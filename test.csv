0,This anti-static wrist band is worth the money. I just wish the band was elastic instead of Velcro.  Will buy another once this one goes bad.
1,"I bought this unit for two reasons - to play MP3's and view DVD's. It seems to handle DVD's fine, but the MP3 features are a mere after-thought. It will NOT shuffle play MP3's, which means you either start with track 1 and play the whole disc through (200+ tracks) or you have to tediously program the tracks you want. What was Sony thinking? So I replaced it with a Samsung DVD-S221, which better suits my needs."
2,"While shopping for new headphones I just realized I bought this item as a kid--13 years ago (Thanks Amazon for reminding me when I've bought something)!I'm not an audiophile so I wouldn't be able to elaborate on the specifics of sound acoustics but I can tell you this: I've had loud neighbors in the past and these headphones were able to block them out. I've never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this. Listening to music with this is quite superb; the bass, mid-range and highs are all equally there.As for the build quality, these have definitely stood the test of time. The original fabric-like material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn away--this DOES NOT affect sound quality. In fact, I think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty. The cord looks like the day I got it, the printing on the plastic has not worn away.The only minor issue (and this is mainly because I've read about it from others), is creaking sound when turning your head. The cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending. Again, I never really noticed it until others pointed it out.I haven't had to replace these for 13 years so gather what you will from that statement. I do not *need* new headphones, but I am window shopping should these ever break (and I hope they don't!). I originally bought these for $90 so I'm not sure why it's now $200+. If you can get them at a good rate I do recommend these fantastic headphones!"
3,"As other reviews here suggest, this device isn't very powerful.  Unless you are really close to your tuner, it may not work.  And it won't work at all in many automobiles.  I gave up and replaced it with an IROCK unit, which works infinitely better (i.e. okay at best).  Obviously the unit fits the iPod really well and it would be great if it worked well.  I also had problems with the station tuning samples--my iPod would often crash playing them, and I eventually got to the point where I couldn't change the channel and couldn't figure out what channel it was playing to.  At that point I gave up and tossed it.  Don't waste your money."
4,"I find the ergonomic keyboard extremely easy and comfortable to use. However, the paint used on the keys begs for improvement. Within a short period of time, the more used keys completely lose their markings which leave something to be desired."
5,Till yesterday I was all praises for this camera and would have given 5 stars. Its got the features for a beginner to reach a serious amature role with low cost. Well yesterday it died on me. I have had the camera for 2.5 years and shot probably around 100 rolls with it.Now its a great camera. Its given me some awesome pictures. I like the metering except the fact that is does not have spot metering. This is a disadvantage. More over the the partial region of the camera is not well defined. I have the eye control. 85% it works and its great. But it does fail and irritates me at times. Low light focus is not so good but with the speedlight(420EX) it focus in a sec. What a difference. The depth of preview button is at time hard to findI love the fash 4 frames per second. I used it twice but it gave me great results. I love the feel of the camera.With all its defects I love the camera and might go in for the same.
6,Has no preamp and not battery powered so all passive. Volume on channels has to be turned up so high that you barely hear anything and full of shhhhhhhhhhh (white noise)Don't buy it.
7,"I bought these headphones for working out.  The sound is pretty good, nothing exceptional or bad.  My biggest problem is that they really pinch your ears after 5-10 minutes.  The springy clips rotate around, but not out.  They compress the upper rigid parts of my ear and it's quite uncomfortable.  If you have a normal or petite ear / head you will probably be alright, but if you are a little bigger in either department these may hurt.  No matter how I adjust them I have the same result.  I will be switching to behind the neck headphones."
8,"Product was delivered quickly and efficiently.  It came in a plastic bag, with a made in china label.  Has no discernible Belkin label anywhere.  It may well be a Belkin product, but there is nothing that would lead you to believe it really is; there is no labeling on the cable, there is no labeling on the package.  The item does as it promises - provides you with a 6' cable that does work.  Usually there is SOME tell...not here.  It is possible belkin sells bulk cables to other manufacturers; it is possible this company may package cabling for Belkin sale and this might be that cable... I paid a bit more because I like knowing I am getting the product advertised but there isn't much to confirm that in this case."
9,constant drop outs and just a flimsy service overall.  thought at first it seemed alright - but after it kinda retires itself.
10,"This is a nice cheap adaptor, but don't expect the female 1/4&#34; jack to last forever. If you're using for a one-time hookup, you'll most likely be fine. But after multiple inserts and removals, the 1/4&#34; female jack loses it's grip which results in signal loss."
11,"These are the best headphones that I've ever owned. I am prone to headaches, I work in a loud environment, and I like high quality sound. These over-ear headphones block out a lot of noise, don't squeeze too tightly on my head, and have incredible sound quality. I am very happy!"
12,"I have never had a huge problem burning music onto cd-r discs till I purchased these Memorex.  I am an avid Amazon customer but I did not purchase these from them.  I still felt I owed it to all buyers to warn them.  Had I bought them from Amazon I would have been able to return them hassle free with the huge problems I encountered.  Regretfully I purchased a 100 spindle of these Memorex cd-r discs somewhere else and 20 out of 25 have been unusable and turned into everready coasters.  I have a great HP computer with a superb recording drive andd also use Roxio as my main recording source.  Over the past 5 years I have used many different brands from name brands to store brands and honestly never had problems other than the rare and random fluke bad cd.  But here whenever I go to record my own playlist the cds have a mind of their own and will burn some of the songs but not all.  Like everyone else I thought it was me until I realized howe many hours and discs I had gone through.  I tried burning through itunes as well as Roxio and I am not a novice.  I do know what I am doing.So, does anyone out there want 50 coasters?  I won't even attempt using these ridiculously subpar cd-r discs.  And as one other reviewer said items such as this really are basically a 1 or 5 star product.  If you purchase a 100 spindle pack and have 2-3 discs that may not work that is a 5 star product but if you use over 50 of them and 40 do not work as is my new score at the time of finalizing this review that is in no way anything above a 1 star product.  Please be kind to yourself, avoid the hassle and purchase another brand.  Last note, I found a cd-r review site that categorized excellent quality, medium quality and bad quality cd-rs and Memorex was on the bad list.  And remember, Amazon sells the product but is not responsible for its subpar performance."
13,"I see now why the reviews are so torn, this product can be good or bad completely depending on the type of laptop you have.  I learned this after I bought two of these for my laptops and here's what I found:1- 15.6&#34; Toshiba touch screen 2013 laptop: On a high resolution touch screen I would rate this a 1-star.  If you have one of these newer laptops that's touch screen Windows 8 you need to avoid this privacy filter.  After one day of use I removed it and never used it again.  The touch screen functionalities fall away when you have this on and the high resolution just looks far too faded. Also, major air bubbles that I could not get out no matter what I did.  That and the faded look make it impossible to look at the screen - too distracting!2- 14&#34; Lenovo corporate laptop 2010: Perfect!  On this laptop I deployed the glue method, it stuck on first try no air bubble and no problems.  I haven't take it off since and it's a perfect look and fit.If you have a chance to go to a store to see it and talk to someone about it I would recommend that because your experience will truly be unique to your laptop."
14,"I think about a week from today, this thing broke on me. I've had it for about 4 months, and you guess it, the CD changer broke. I had a CD stuck in it, and it took me a long time for me to get it out. I eventually did. The radio and tape player still work, but the CD player is completely dead. I'm returning it tomorrow hoping that 1) it was just a malfunction that won't happen again and 2) that the store will actually take it back for a new one. I hope this doesn't happen again.UPDATE ON 12/20/04Well this is just fine and dandy. I have the stuff I need to return it including receipt (is that how you spell it?), but Wal-Mart is unwilling to help me. Sony said take it to the shop in Tucson. The shop was also unwilling to help and said it would cost $100. HELLO THE WARRANTY IS ONE YEAR!!! They obviously don't care and said it costs $20 to even look at it. Now, I'm taking it to another repair shop called Martin's something and it will only cost about half of the Sony repair. Gee, thanks Sony! Thanks Wal-Mart! I know I should have purchased the RCA at Best Buy. How silly of me."
15,"I have a 32 MB Sandisk Compact Flash card for my Nikon Coolpix 950, a 2-megapixel digital cam.  This card will allow you to record about 50 pictures at the standard (640x480) resolution, so if you find you're not a  'power user' of your camera, it should be plenty - and the  dollars-to-megabyte ratio is right!However, if you regularly shoot at  higher resolutions such as 1600x1200 (i.e. 8&quot; x 10&quot; photo  quality), you won't be able to fit 20 photos on this card.  In that event,  you might want to think about going for their 96MB card (also available  from Amazon!)With this size card you might also want to think about  going for Sandisk's inexpensive USB card reader - it's up to 50x as fast  and a lot less hassle than hooking the camera up to the computer!"
16,"I love music and demand great sound quality in my headphones. With that said... The MDR-V6 Monitor Headphones are the stuff of Legend. They've been making these babies for well over a decade, and as far as I know their quality has always stayed true.  They have stood the test of time, and will give you the most ""bang for buck"" compared to any other model. And when you see how these are packaged, you'll see that Sony still has much pride in their product. There are so many reasons why I think these headphones are a true ""Classic"", but I don't want to re-iterate what thousands (if not millions) have already said about these through the years.  If you're in the market for Great Monitor Headphones (for a very reasonable price), don't hesitate to buy these. You won't be disappointed.Pros:-Amazing and Balanced Sound-For what you're getting, these headphones are truly a great value.-Long cord 10 foot cord.-large headphone adapter included.-Great build quality, they should last you for many years... and even then, you'll probably only need to change the ear pads.Cons:-None (except that I wish they were indestructible... but that's not gonna happen (and unrealistic :)"
17,"These are just about the best headphones you can get for ~$25.The entire sound range is great.  Great response, great bass, clear midrange.  Gives the original Sennheiser PX-100 (another excellent headphone) a run for its money at less than half the price.By the way - The drivers are identical to the famous Koss PortaPro Headphones.  Despite what some claim, the sound between the Sportapro and the Portapro is identical.  I've owned at least 3 pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two.  Just buy whichever is cheaper."
18,I received this coupler with a piece of plastic broken off on the inside of one half which prevented it from working at all. Just bad luck.
19,"17 Mar 2013.  Update, four years later:This lens has been in the shop for repair twice; the vibration reduction motor has given out on me twice.  The second time, customer service from Nikon was horrible, so bad that a repair dept. manager called me and assured me that he would make sure, personally, that my lens was repaired correctly.  And yet?  When I got it back?  It wasn't repaired AT ALL.  It still had the same problem.So far I'm out $1200 in repair and shipping charges on this lens, not counting what I paid out for a rental lens once so I wouldn't be caught out.  And I still have a lens that doesn't work.I have bought a Sigma 70-200, f2.8, and it's working like a champ.  I'm about to head in to do battle with Nikon -- I think that given the time and money I've put in on this lens, I really ought to at least have it repaired correctly, and no, I don't have any intention of giving them any more money for it.Frankly, at this point, I think it might be of more use to me converted into a travel mug.******Okay, this is my new baby.  God, it takes spectacular photos.  I do concert photography in dark venues, and I took it out last night to shoot a show, and I got some *amazing* photographs.  Just spectacular.  Will post a few when I get them sorted out.People are correct when they say that this lens is heavy, but I'm 5'3"" and I weigh 120 pounds soaking wet, and I did not notice the weight being an issue when I was shooting last night (hand-held, over a period of about four hours); I was having too much fun taking amazing pictures.  Use a proper grip, stay balanced, and it feels like the high performance machine that it is in your hands.In a couple of weeks, I'll be hitting a festival, shooting constantly from Friday afternoon until Sunday night.  Saturday will be 11 am to two or three in the morning.  I'll post again and let you know how tired I am of the weight after that.  But right now I'm delighted with this purchase."
20,"First the pros:Large ball feels very nice and scrolls very smoothly.The unit (aside from the item mentioned below) seems well made.The buttons have a nice positive click to them.Now on to the cons:I had to send mine back.  The scroll wheel had something wrong with it.  When it scrolled it felt like it was out of round and scratched and scraped around as it turned.  Whereas my mouse feels like I'm rolling a rubber wheel on glass, this felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on hard plastic.  Reading the other reviews it turns out this may be by design?!  Apparently it has to ""wear in.""  I really have a hard time believing that mine would ever ""wear in"" enough to be acceptable.That notwithstanding, the design on this trackball is really hard for me to understand.  Now this is probably a matter of personal preference, so try one out yourself and see.  The angle you have to hold your hand at to use this is terrible.  My wrist started hurting almost immediately.  I have a Logitech Trackman and it fits my hand perfectly.  This was just really awkward to use.  Even with the supplied wrist rest the angle of extension on my wrist is just to much for me.The large size of the ball combined with the inclination of the device places the top of the ball about  2.7 inches off the desk and about 1.2 inches above the part of the device where my hand rests (with the pad installed).  Without the pad my hand rests on the desk.  To compare, the top of the ball on the Trackman sits about 1.5 inches from the surface of the desk and only about 3/8 of an inch above the part of the device on which the back of my hand wrests.  This feels much more natural to me.Again, the caveat here is that this is one person's opinion.  I think a trackball is a very personal thing and it depends a lot on your own preference.  However, all the research I've done indicates that wrist extension and flexion are things you want to avoid.  Your write should rest in a natural position as much as possible.  I don't see a way to accomplish that with this device."
21,Good Quality and a good price.  Belkin is a name I respect because they have always provided a reliable & sturdy product line.  This simple USB cable gets the job done nicely.
22,Extends across the kitchen about ~15 ft.Begins to get a little tight. Isn't stretched out or anything yet as well.I like the product but the Pb issue or warning says higher than some standard.I don't know why it would have lead on it. Says in the wires. I didn't see no need for solder.Many products should be Rohs by now. (lead free)I don't even know why lead would need to be used on a phone cord.
23,"I do not regret buying it, but it is slow on shuffle. Expect it to last only a year or so, I had a 300 CD Sony changer before this that started skipping after 11 months of use. Frankly, I am surprised at this lack of quality from Sony.Added edit on December 12, 2006: This is now skipping, too. I'm not pleased."
24,I bought two of these and they work fine as long you don't plug and unplug them very often. They feel very cheap and if I pull on the ends at all they move. I would not trust it if I was going to be plugging and unplugging it often.
25,"These fall into the you get what you pay for category.  They're bulky, hot and uncomfortable after 10-15 minutes.  Getting the volume to balance is as difficult as getting the US Congress to agree on anything.  Spend a little more, get a lot more."
26,"won't accept male plugs.  I'm not sure if I got the one bad one or if this is a regular problem.  Fortunately, it is cheap enough for me not to bother to return it."
27,The first lens out of plastic bag can not be used.  Dust blocks light.  How dirty can you get?
28,"I teach a counseling skills course at a local community college, and needed this for the students to turn in an audio recording of an interview. Not all students are into the digital realities of today, so this analog tape recorder did the trick.I gave it three stars, 'cause it only runs on batteries ... there's no where to plug in an A/C adaptor (my preference).If ya gotta go tape, this unit is alright."
29,"I gave it 3 stars because the only problem with it is crappy documentation. The Device itself works flawlessly and I give that 5 stars. I have a Vista Machine and i was having problems like others mentioned, However the fixed proved surprisingly easy. I uninstalled all the crap the disc installed on my pc.Works flawlessly ever since, connected a Bluetooth Logitech Mediaboard Pro and a Cellphone and it works great.So for any others who cant get it working on vista do yourself a favor and throw the manual and the disc out and trust vista to install it and set the bluetooth for Discoverable mode."
30,"I really prefer vertical in-ear headphones - they don't block out surrounding sounds completely, and are less likely to damage ears with too much volume.The sound quality of these Koss headphones is decent for the price - no problems there.The fit, on the other hand, is very awkward, especially for smaller ears.  The speakers are large and the edges are rough, making for an uncomfortable fit.Also the back-of-the-head band is NOT adjustable, so all-around, it's a bad fit for anyone not of the largest build.Your money's better spent on the Sony vertical, ADJUSTABLE, headphones - style #MDR W08L"
31,"I love the Sony quality sound, but I've gone through about 4 pairs of these headphones in a year and stopped buying them.  The spot where the two cords come together to become one is the weak spot, and anywhere from a few weeks to a few months you start noticing one side getting lower and lower til you can't hear it anymore.  I think Sony has it right in the sound quality, but they need to rethink the construction so they don't break so easily."
32,"I bought this remote to replace the remotes for my sony TV, phillips DVD player, Panasonic VCR, a Fisher stereo system, and, hopefully, a HDTV set-top box in the future. I've been able to get it to learn codes to do most of the functions of each component, but not without difficulties. First, using the learn function is not always successful, even though the unit says success, it's not always true. Sometimes it takes two or three tries to get it to work. Second, some things it just won't learn. It can't seem to learn to switch some of the functions on my Fisher stereo. Third, it didn't take long to use up the learned memory, and I still have lots that I want to program into it. I know I can go out and buy a cable and so on, but why should I have to do that? I should be able to use whatever memory is available to fully customize it to do what I want it to do. Oh well, I like a challenge so I will probably end up with the cable and software someday.I like the feel of the remote, the buttons have a quality feel to them plus the remote has a solid feel since it is a little on the heavy side, not an issue unless your toddler throws it at your head like mine does. It's also durable and has survived a few drops and throws.Pricewise, it's a good buy, even at full price. Lot's of features for the money.Most liked feature: Buttons light up (though I wish they were green or blue, not red)Least liked feature: Not enough memory available."
33,"This cable works like I expected it.  It came in on time, wrapped perfectly and it works great.  The price was right too!"
34,"The price should maybe be lower because the wires seem just average.  Some days i have to wiggle the jack for a second to get one side to work. But it is not that annoying and it might be the computer jack's fault, in which case i would say 4 stars not 3. I'ld buy it again just cause i did not see a better made one in the short time i looked on amazon."
35,I bought this cable for a recent trip so my wife and I could both listen to movies through our headphones on our Galaxy Tab. We initially had some trouble getting the cable to work properly. At first my wife would hear music while I would hear the voices. After playing with the cable for a little bit it ended up working and we were really grateful that we bought it.
36,I have these hooked up to my computer because I listen to Radio and watch NetFlex while I shop or read.  These work great as far as blocking the TV noise.
37,"I am a petite person (5' 1"") and the headphones did not fit on my ears at all."
38,neither the cd that it comes with nor the d-link website has vista drivers.  you either have to use bluesoliel 6 on a trial version and have data transfer limited or purchase it.
39,Product is what I expected. The software that came with it had to be upgraded from the website. I still have not gotten it to work.July 2013. Do not purchase this item. It never worked. After more research found out it was a cheap Chinese imitation!
40,"This is NOT a touch lamp, though product description says so.  Read the most recent reviews. Of about 17 or so reviews since May 24, 2010, as many as 15 says this lamp is NOT a touch lamp! Nevertheless, Amazon.com keeps selling it as a touch lamp!  I've been a satisfied Amazon.com buyer for many years, but this is the first time I have encountered something as bad as this.It is a pretty lamp, and is probably worth the price if you don't mind turning it on and off using the conventional switch on the cord.  But look for something else if you want a touch lamp.  I have returned it for a refund."
41,"I tried plugging this chord into my mac and iPhone, and the male connection was loose, making the connection bad, and staticy if moved around."
42,"Don't waste your money, the sound of this headphone is very bad.And the price is too expensive to this bad quality."
43,"This KVM switch is very well built.  I switch it between Windows and Linux machines without issue.CAVEAT: The unit only switches using the front panel buttons.  It does not support a hotkey sequence.  The manufacturer's website incorrectly represents this.  If this feature is significant to you (like it was for us) you need to purchase the UR-14+, and not the UR-14 or UR-14-KIT.  Very easy-to-confuse part numbering doesn't improve my opinion of this manufacturer.Another item to keep in mind about this device: whenever you switch PCs, it emulates plugging and unplugging of your keyboard & mouse.  Doing this repeatedly can cause instability in some less mature USB stacks.  The UR-14+ doesn't do this; it emulates an idle mouse & keyboard for all the other PCs."
44,"An excellent product, the audio quality is commensurate with the cost. Its design is perfect and comfortable. I've used products like this headset PRO2 and for less money obtiee very similar performance.Excellent, I recommend it."
45,"My 1st digital, so maybe I'm somewhat biased, got a great deal (less then $500) on camera, battery, and charger was display unit, local Bxxx Bxx had close out on this model for some reason.The good:GREAT detail, 3.4 meg is fantastic, have had 8 x 10's made, very comparable to 35mm.Easy to use in AUTO Mode Easy to use in SCENE ModeThe Bad:One irritating point is the &quot;noise&quot; the camera makes as it tries to focus. The Nikon 880 makes a lot of &quot;whizzing&quot; sounds as it focuses -- a bit too conspicuous in quiet environments.MUST have rechager and rechargeable batteriesNo photo editing s/w included.If you get beyond point and shoot, it is VERY complicated!Bottom Line: I REALLY like this camera it takes incredible pictures."
46,"I got this because the studs I used to use would always fall out when I went on a run or a bike ride. Little did I know that the wire connects to the left ear piece that then sends another wire to the right ear piece. Major fail. Someone wasn't thinking when designing this headset. It's extremely annoying to wrap up and store anywhere. It always get tangled and is a pain to unwrap and wear...To make matters worse, when it's on, it actually starts to hurt my ears after about 15 minutes. Maybe I have big ears or maybe it's just too tight of a hard plastic build, I can't decide... also, when I had it on during my bus ride home I'd have to turn the volume up because my bus isn't the quietest ride which would be okay except that everyone around me can then also hear what I listen to... I would have loved some more noise canceling or a less public listening experience at higher volumes...(like with my ear buds)Now, I only keep these in my work out bag in case I want to use it on the treadmill or for a run. I definitely would NOT get these as my primary pair of headphones."
47,"I bought this CD player simply because it was the only one I could find that was not too wide for my entertainment center.  Unfortunately, it's a roll of the dice whether the disc changer will work with the remote or not--usually not.  Also, It's a roll of the dice whether the player will play a CD or not.  I've had brand new CD's out of the box not play at all on this player.  I've moved them to another player and they work perfectly.  So--unless you're really desperate, I'd pass this CD player by...."
48,"There are a lot of nice things about this camera that are mentioned in the other reviews.  I just want to alert you of some of the drawbacks that lead me to give it three stars.1.  The autofocus is slow and there is significant delay from when you push the button to when the photo is taken.2.  Pictures of things in motion come out blurry.  For example, I took the camera to the park with my children and photos of them on the slide, swing etc. all came out blurry.3.  The battery dosen't last very long if you use the LCD display and the flash.  If you buy the camera, you should get the extra battery.4.  If you are using the flash, it takes about 30 seconds for the flash to recharge between pictures.These might seem like small things, but I've been using the camera to take pictures of my children and it seems like I miss the nice shots because the camera hasn't focused or I'm waiting for the flash to recharge or my kids look away between the time that I push the button and the picture is actually taken."
49,"I bought these two months ago after reading all the rave reviews and was not dissapointed. I'm amazed that PortaPro are just $30. I own a pair of V-moda in-ear phones that costed me more than double the price, and a pair of Seinnheiser PMX60. I can safely say that PortaPro are FAR superior sounding than the other two. The best part is their bass. Mids and Highs are great as well. Pretty comfortable to wear. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is their 80's look. But headphones are for listening, so I'm over the looks. Highly recommended."
50,"I just got these a week ago and am ready to throw them in the garbage. The sound itself is fine (I thought it would be a lot better than the earbuds included with my iPod, but it's not), but the design is so annoying and useless that I had to warn other people away from making the same mistake I did.Sony has designed the cord to be extremely short (you CANNOT clip your iPod--or any other MP3 player--to your belt, nor can you even hold it at waist level. So, you MUST use the included extension cord, which is way too long. MY EXTENSION CORD IS USELESS BECAUSE IT HAD A SHORT IN IT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX (there are other postings with this same problem).The design of this impossibly SHORT cord is also configured to cause annoyance and frustration. The left side of the cord is much shorter than the right, so it's very easy to turn your head and have the earbud pop out of your ear. At the very least, you get a tugging sensation.These faults render the Sony MDR-EX71SL Headphone useless for running, taking to the gym, or other active endeavors.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. IT STINKS!!"
51,When I received this item I expected the battery that came with it to work.  It was dead.  Have no idea how to get hold of the supplier to deal with this problem.
52,Though it has an LCD window the buttons are far too similar with small print; no backlight on the LCD so it's hard to read; and doesn't really display much of use. Better off getting a cheaper model that's easier to use.
53,It works. Ends are secure. Nice sheathing but not to stiff. Not much else to add about a  CAT cable is there?
54,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this tripod was very weak. the legs were flimsy, the mount for the camera always made me worry that my Sony Alpha-100 would fall off, and the telescoping mid-section couldn't bear the weight and would drop down suddenly. Get something slightly more expensive and thank yourself later."
55,"Bought for my daughter for her sound engineering class.  They are versatile (2 types of connection) for home and studio.  Great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well.  Highly recommend. Not the best money can buy, but a good deal."
56,"All the other reviewers are in fact correct; you'll be lucky enough if 50% of the package aren't dud CDs. I tried the dud CDs on four total computers, so I know my technology is not at fault. The computers wil spit them back out in the beginning; deeming them as unwritable... Or when it is close to 99% completed, the computer will come up with an error message. Do not waste your TIME and MONEY. It literally took me one hour to burn two CDs because I ended up going through SO many CDs just to get the job done. What a huge frustration and headache. Please listen to the one-star reviews. We are not lying about this joke of a product.And as far as ordering these through Amazon... The first product I received was in a huge box with little padding; therefore, the spindle broke and CDs were everywhere. Luckily, Amazon has a wonderful return policy. The next shipment I received was in a smaller box, however, the top clear plastic lid popped off, but since the box matched the item's size, the CDs weren't detached from the spindle."
57,"Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase."
58,"The main reason for getting this accordion extension is because the distance from my vintage Dokorder receiver, and my bed, is just a little too far for me to use my Sony MDR-V6 studio monitors, when listening to audio books, or music.  The Sony accordion cord will make it but it is just too tight for comfort.  I have a nice accordion extension somewhere, but can't find it.  So instead of tearing up everything, I decided to get this one.  One can't have too many small necessities.After reading the one, and two, stars, it is apparent that half of the one stars are 'sour grapes' ratings for not getting perfection at a very very low price.  Obviously the 'entitlement mentality' is alive and well in the US.I'm giving this extension cord four stars because the weight  of the cord is less than that of my lost extension cord, and also my Sony cord.  And too, the length is something to be aware of, since Maxell is using the ideal starting length before the cord was heat treated in order to make it an accordion unit.  But that is something that anyone using common sense would know up front.Sound quality wise, things are no less than anticipated.  Expecting sound to be as good as one without another connection, is expecting too much.  Electrons flow from point A to point B, and any connection short being fused together is going to offer resistance in the flow of electrons, which will cause the signal to be ideally less than without the joint.  Again, another common sense issue.As for loose connections, I tried the connection to my Sony, and it was solid.  However, plugging into the Dokorder's 'phones jack, the connection was less than tight where it fit into the 1/4"" Sony adaptor.  But that I can forgive, because the cord will disconnect before it does damage to the adapter, and I think this was intentional.Over all, a product that is of sound quality.  The length and weight of the cord is not audiophile quality, but I am not paying audiophile prices either.  To all the disenfranchised one star raters, if this is enough to totally ruin your weekend, you have more than just a problem here.  I suggest you seek counseling."
59,It operates by inferred.  This is not for the D200.  Sent it back.  The description said it worked with the Nikon D200.
60,"Although the B end of the cable did not fit as snugly into my microphone as the original shorter cord that came with microphone does, and this cable had a tendency to want to fall out upon initially plugging it in, it still has good signal quality and did not result in any static or any noticeable unwanted background noise to occur. A little work on the B end of the cable with a pair of pliers to correct the shape of the plug and everything is just about as it should be so I'll give the cable partial marks."
61,"While the features and ease of use may be good on the A70, the overall quality and durabilty is VERY POOR.  My camera developed a fuzzy spot (presumed inside the sealed lens) that appears at the top corner of every photo.  A panel on the body also has begun to loosen, even though the camera has always been cased, and never mishandled.In reading other complaints and problems in this forum, it seems that Canon sees users of its consumer cameras as idiots, who will gleefully send these cameras back to the factory and pay a further $150 (plus shipping) for a refurbished replacement.I suggest you purchase a higher-quality brand (Nikon, Leica), and leave Canon to sort out its obvious Quality Control problems on other, less-informed consumers."
62,"stay away from Hawking Technology!!  This thing doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for majority of people.  Contacted tech support and wasted many hours.  Didn't work for Minolta PagePro 1350WI've updated firmware, etc.  configured it through the web.  tried various ways of network setting, none of it worked.  document just got stick in the print queue under xp and windows 7.  tried rebooting the print server and printer.  No avail.finally, go to their web site and it won't list print server compatibility."
63,"If you have the Jornada, you have to get it.  It is loads better than toting your laptop around.  I keep both in my jacket pocket and haul em out whenever I feel the urge to be productive or write in my journal...which I then sync with my desktop.  Sweet."
64,"I ""sort of love"" this Cobra Roadtrip CB gadget, but only when I'm home and when I can use my both hands on it.  It's a bit cumbersome to use while driving and it's too heavy to handle, especially if you have batteries installed in it, so for that purpose I recommend buying the external microphone.  I bought a BNC to standard VHF antenna adapter so I can attach my ""real"" home and car CB antennas to it.Most important thing to remember is to use the external antenna - it's practically useless without it when you're in a car, unless you have a buddy in a car next to yours.  Antenna, preferably external, is the key part of every CB station.  I have a 102"" whip antenna and I sometimes take it up to the roof of our 15 floor building and talk to people who can't believe how far I am.  Moreover, they can't believe that I'm talking from a hand-held, battery operated CB radio. In order to persuade them, I just unscrew that antenna and use the smaller telescopic one and if they can hear me they will confirm I sound like it should.  One guy about 5 miles away was saying that his signal meter was close to the max while I was using the big antenna and he could barely hear me with the telescopic one.The major flaw of this radio when I compare it to my low end Midland CB is the way its squelch feature works (or does not).  I don't know whether it's just my particular radio or whether this is a flaw of the entire series, but you have to set your squelch level unreasonably high, which makes you miss a lot of conversations further away from you.  When you set your squelch level a bit lower, or whenever someone is right on the edge of squelch threshold, you will hear a lot of unusual noise coming from the radio, almost as if it is undecided and it keeps oscillating back and forth from passing and blocking the signal. This sounds like a driver next to you is pressing and releasing the PTT button 4-5 times a second and it is much louder than the rest of the sounds you can hear on this radio, so it can be very disturbing, especially when you are driving and your loved one is asleep next to you.NiMh batteries last forever and I don't ever connect it to my car's 12 V lighter output any more.  However, another downside is that it requires two different external sources, one for charging the batteries and the other for just using the car power.  The provided cable is good only for using the car power and it doesn't charge the batteries.  Why not use the same connection for both?The manufacturer claims that Soundtracker ""...dramatically improves the sound quality of the transmission and reception of CB radio signals.""  I can't see a big difference.All in all, it's pretty cool to have a hand held CB, but that's all what it is.  I don't recommend it for drivers."
65,"It seems to do what it is made for. But I found the following issues:1) The device creates a laud hiss sound when the source sound is silent. So the quiet moments become horrible. I think there should be a threshold where the device stops amplifying the source sound.2) Once, I got to a song that has different levels of volume in a short period of time. The device kicked in and released like crazy and I had to turn it off."
66,"In general, I really like Sony products, and I started out really liking these a few years ago. I have three pairs now, and the two newest pairs have started the wire-shredding thing you've probably read about. The oldest and most-used pair has a more ""plasticy"" feel to the wires, whereas the newer ones are rubbery and stretchy, and will continue to deteriorate over time. This is a well-known issue with these lately, so if you can get ones with the plasticy wires, you should be in great shape. BUT, once you've tried high-end in-ear-monitors (IEMs) like Ultimate Ears or Shure, you'll do what I did and give these away or sell 'em outright. Would have been 4 stars without the recent quality issue.Pros:Decent sound. Although you can do better in this price range with Sennheiser, Panasonic, or Creative, these are by no means ""horrible"". A definite HUGE step up from whatever lousy free 'buds you may have gotten with your player. STRONG bass, lots of treble. Cute carrying case, nice to have different size tips to use to get the fit right. They don't protrude from your ears, so you can probably sleep in them if you want to. If you buy them, buy 'em here.Cons:Durabilty, durability, and durability. I'm personally going to avoid these for a while until Sony gets the wire issue sorted out. Bass, while strong, is not detailed or controlled. Treble, while definitely there, is subject to painful sibilance at higher levels. Cute little case will fall apart quickly.Bottom line: Formerly a good product for the price, but you should try to find something else if you haven't already been stuck with these."
67,"I use this to connect my MP3 player to modern AV equipment (TVs, stereos, etc.). works well and is just long enough."
68,"I found this product to work well and serve the purpose of sound control in my cubicle at the office. The cord is long enough to move around easily and I can even use just one earpiece when/if I am needing to listen for visitors, etc.I found it to be well worth the price."
69,Onkyo is a relatively large japanese audio maker.Onkyo is popular but middle class maker.Accuphase and Luxman are the best japanese audio makers.
70,"Piece of junk.  I used it for 4-5 months without incident, but it always ran hot, not warm, HOT.  I came down one morning and the KVM switch was so hot it burned my hand.  Went to check my computer and found the KVM literally fried my MS keyboard and MS optical mouse (on PS2 adapter) - keyboard dead - MS mouse had a MELT MARK underneath (no joke!).Thier tech support is overseas (ergo: terrible), I sat on hold forever trying to get an RMA.  All I really wanted was to make them aware that this switch is possibly a manufacturer defect, and quite possibly a fire hazard.  They claim no one ever called to complain about it before.  Amazon's review section proved them wrong, and I told her so.I went with an IOGEAR KVM switch at half the price.  If that one dies I'm going with a hard wired KVM box for more money intead of these 'all in one' switch units, I think it'll be worth the piece of mind since I use my computers for a living at home.  I can't take the risk some junky cable could destroy my livelihood while I sleep.Linksys claims they never heard any issues with this unit overheating or melting down components, but if you search the web you'll find lots of ""my computer will not post, connected to Linksys KVM switch.""  This thing is overpriced garbage and a fire hazard as far as I'm concerned.  Avoid cheaply made overpriced junk like this."
71,"Idk it the faults i find are just because its supposed to be a certain way but these headphones dont make me bob my head and feel the music when im listening to it. Buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about. It picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from Tupac's song (Who do u believe in) i've never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had, even from the KOSS portapro, which are also freakin amazing. The bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because they're not intented to be that way. So in conclusion, these head phones, to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording, which is why i bought them. So =DOh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my Macbook pro, a little staticy sound, very very faint, is noticeable when u move the jack."
72,"Linksys appears to be riding on their reputation.  During the 1990s, their stuff was top notch and we bought nothing but Linksys.  Then, they were purchased by Cisco, and their quality appears to have nosedived since then.We had the exact same experience as another poster, with indicator lights remaining on after the plugs were pulled from the corresponding sockets, and within a day, the whole unit died.We've stopped buying Cisco/Linksys and found Netgear products to be what Linksys used to be: well made at attractive prices.  I'd suggest anyone looking to purchase Linksys products look into Netgear instead."
73,"Great product, works as expected but creates lots of shadows on the screen that are not there when plugged in directly so they are artifacts from the switch box."
74,"Personally, I prefer using a sharpie to label my baby's clothes, but my wife is into the whole label maker thing and labels everything that's his. Sooo, I went and got this product. It does what it's supposed to do, but be remember that any iron on adhesive will eventually fail after time. Otherwise, I like the labels."
75,"As the owner of a ten year-old, 8mm tape, chunky sized Sony handheld VCR/TV unit, I really looked forward to this RCA Lycra. Boy were my expectations too high!As someone else said, RCA made a premature release. I am tech savvy and cannot record video from my computer using every codec available. This is only good for recording directly from the TV (cable box, TV set, VCR). The provided RCA web link does not even work!!The video is very poor. I know it's analog, but so is my Sony and its video quality's better. The RCA has several features that are not yet active. So why put it on the market?After plugging in the USB, there's no previewing until it's unplugged. After unplugging it, you are asked to reset the unit...huh? Then the unit turns off. You turn it back on, in my case, only to discover that the video file does not play.This is a tease because while I'm tempted to return it, I am already attached to the ""idea"" of it. I will record mostly from the cable box, so it serves that purpose. I also have a long commute to work and this'll make it easier.I'm sure improvements will come, but they should never have put this on the shelves as-is now. It only gives the competition an idea of what NOT to do."
76,Got this cable to connect from my laptop to my printer. Works great and pc had no issues with it.
77,"I have been gradually upgrading my home network to full-on Gigabit, and this little piece of junk was the last thing standing in my way.  No more.I have the GS105v2 (from a while ago), and while I believed it was the first step to gigabit nirvana, it proved itself to be the last step preventing me from reaching nirvana.  When I removed it from the network, I finally enjoyed all the speed I'd been paying for.My now-working network consists of anASUS RT-N16 Wireless-N Gigabit Router, a pair ofTRENDnet 8-Port Gigabit GREENnet Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps Auto-Negotiation, Auto-MDIX Gigabit Ethernet Ports) TEG-S80G, and anHP ProCurve Switch 1810G-8 - Switch - managed - 8 ports - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet - 10Base-T, 100Base-TX, 1000Base-T - 1U - external, and now I've got Gigabit actually working.  When I insert the Netgear into the mix, it lies by telling me that it's made a gigabit connection, and proceeds to throttle traffic such that a 2GB file transfer would take over an hour (instead of under a minute).  Bad!"
78,"This is one of many Monster brand cables I purchased over the course of my life and only recently realized that I paid about 10x what the product should actually cost.  For many years (basically from the early 90's until the late 00's) Monster had a brilliant marketing scheme whereby they trained B&M electronics store employees to push their absurdly overpriced cables whenever anyone purchased an HDTV, Blu-Ray player, A/V receiver, etc.  The employees would tell people things like &#34;your new HDTV won't work without this gold-plated Monster HDMI cable&#34; or &#34;you won't get full 1080p resolution if you buy brand XYZ HDMI cable&#34; and other nonsense.  There was once a time when gold-tipped, ferrite-shielded, magic-imbued widgets actually had an impact on picture/sound quality, however, with the use of digital signals, all of that is obsolete.  Digital signal quality is not boosted at all by any of Monster's technological mumbo-jumbo; as long as the 0's and 1's make it from point A to point B, everything else is irrelevant.  Please do yourself a favor and Google all of this as it was a real eye-opener for me.  I now try as hard as I can to dissuade family, friends and other consumers from feeding the coffers of the greedy Monster.  Please look at excellent alternatives such as Monoprice, Blue Jeans Cable, Amazon Basics, etc and buy a product that is just as good or better than the Monster cables for a fraction of the price."
79,"These are good, blocks off all sound so you stay focused, so when I'm in grind mode in the studio I'm in GRIND MODE. Only thing is, if listening on high volume in a tight place, like the car, EVERYONE will hear what your listening to. EVERYONE. Just wish somehow it would stay within the headphones, and you."
80,"they were kind of a waste of my money to me. the sound is too poor of quality for thirty. the treble was good but no bass. if you want good sound quality get earbuds they are the best especially the MDR-EX51LP and the E2C. if your buying these for running id get the sony brand they are cheaper and are the same sound quality but if you want good sound quality for running get clip earbuds. earbuds are probably better becauseallthe sound goes into your ear and none of it is lost. clip, behind the neck, and lightweight headphones arent good because the sound goes into the air. so yeah like i said i would get earbuds, clip earbuds, or the big studio headphones with the ear cushions, the sound isnt lost. if your low on money though and want to spend less than twenty or maybe even ten try MDR-E828LP and HA-X570 and MDR-J10 for good sound under twenty."
81,"I just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair. The old ones still sound GREAT, but unfortunately I didn't bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well, so they started cracking, and after dropping them, one of the swivels stopped working, so they didn't stay on right.With minimal precautions, you too can make these last for years and years - just apply some leather protector once in a while, and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor. These things are the best headphones I've ever owned, and it was well worth another $100 to purchase a second pair. The first pair served me well, and actually sound great still - they're just not comfortable, due in NO part to the quality of the headphones themselves.They are solid, and it's nice to have a cord on only one side. It really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each side.Highly recommend these even for those of you who aren't DJs. These are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk. I can't hear A THING, and people are always waving their arms at me to get my attention.These have an amazing level of bass, better than any I have heard in any headphones before. It's an experience, these are."
82,"I've used this and the 100 F2.8 L series macro and this is as sharp under most circumstances at half the cost.  The L series offers image stabilization (IS) and while I don't see that as a macro issue, these lenses are GREAT for portraiture and general use.  So, if you plan to do that sort of thing (and are not always on a tripod) and especially if you love sunset landscapes or candid portraits the IS might throw you to the L series.  If not, this is your lens!"
83,"It's not a perfect fit but good enough for my usage. I find that it's darker than I would like. I understand that it's to prevent onlookers on the side to see your screen but it's sometimes annoying when I have to squint so much. Luckily I only use it on airplanes and public places, reducing the possible near vision damage that it would cause."
84,"Before I review the product itself, let me just say how terrible the Linksys / Cisco support was when I called. When I got the obligatory Indian support representative and after he asked me what the device I was calling about, he said he was going to put me on hold so that he could ""validate the (mumble)"". ""Validate the WHAT?"", I asked. ""Validate the (mumble)"", he said again. Eventually I agreed to let him put me on hold, but it was never clear what he was ""validating"", though I hear from people who've been there that in India it's not uncommon for people to ""validate"" in ditches in public places. I guess for a $35 device I shouldn't expect top-notch technical support, but I digress.On the other hand, I did expect the thing to work, and it does . . . sort of. The hardware I have isn't exactly Brand X: I have a Microsoft (manufacturer) / Dell (reseller) keyboard and a Logitech Trackman Marble keyboard and I'm using Windows XP. So this is pretty mainstream hardware and software we're talking about. Anyway, to make a long story short, despite getting no help from technical support (they told me the device was defective and that I should return it), I eventually got it mostly working. ""Mostly"" meaning that it sometimes misses mouse clicks, usually one of a pair of left double-clicks; you know, the kind you use practically every minute that you're on your computer. If I click more slowly (i.e., allow more time between clicks) it works most of the time, but what the heck is that about? It's a hardware device, for goodness sake: I shouldn't be able to double-click too quickly. What's it doing, anyway? ""Validating""? I guess my Indian friend was right about one thing: I do need to send it back. And I will."
85,"I have never tried other wireless headphones, so I did not know what to expect. These headphones will only work in the room where the base is...that is not too much of a problem because I use them to watch movies when others in the house need quiet, but the amount of hiss and noise is quite distracting. No matter how I fiddled with the volume of the unit and the volume of the surround sound system I could still hear it.One other thing that may be purely personal: I usually am reclining on the sofa when I watch the movies, with my head propped on pillows--these headphones have a ""behind the head"" design that is much less comfortable when you are laying back.The only really good thing for me was the price, but I would be willing to pay more to solve these problems."
86,"The tip for cleaning lens will not last long while the brush is convenient for removing  dust and other fine particles. Also good for mirror system.  Just don't  count on the tip  holding up, purchase a micro cloth and air blower. (I purchased a nasal aspirator and works well. Also much cheaper than a camera bulb)."
87,it's a cable so nothing to get really excited over.  It performs well.  Be warned that the 1/8&#34; male end will not likely fit into a phone or tablet that has a bulky case on it as it's kinda fat.  That's the only downside though.
88,"Buying cables is not fun, so of course I went the cheap route. After buying a $10 white cable at radioshack and having it crap out in under a month I gave little thought to buying ""name brand"". So I went on Amazon and bought this one since it was el cheapo. Well there is of course a reason why its so cheap. The cable itself worked for about A week before I lost the left audio channel from my devices completely and only by twisting and crimping the cable in such a delicate manner and being carful not to move my iphone was I able to get stereo sound again ha ha. Also the cable rustles and shakes to the point where you can barely here any audio coming through. And of course it now does the glitch where only the low drum of the lyrics and faded beat come through because the cable is failing. Absolute garbage, but not at all surprised. Recently I tried plugging in the iphone once more just for entertainment and now find that the cable emits a shrill buzzing that increases and decreases pitch based on the rpm's of the car ha ha. It's actually entertaining how much a of a failure this thing is. I don't even think the CEO of the company could hang himself with one of this cables without it snapping in half. Avoid this cable and just bite the bullet and buy the last male to male 35mm jack that you'll ever need."
89,"I've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment.  I use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality, much better than the earbuds I was using before.  The included carrying case is another bonus, as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane."
90,"First, the sound rocks.  I bought them for my teenage kids, but have swiped a pair since they block outside noise great and the sound is just awesome.However, they are huge.  I didn't think they would be that big and that is the one reason my daughter doesn't much care for them.  They are quite comfortable and don't seem to give me a headache like others do.  If the size (covers whole side of head) doesn't bother you, they are great. They could adjust a little more, as in the headband part could go a little taller and then they would be just perfect."
91,"1. Very susceptible to fingerprints2. VERY REFLECTIVE3. VERY Hard to keep in place. The stickies provided to hold it to the screen keep falling - and yes, I did clean the area with a solvent before applying them."
92,"I received the product, which does work, but was totally damaged in the container it shipped in.  The stand that they come on was shattered, so I had to find additional means to store the product."
93,"I thought I could get into astronomy but I was wrong. These binoculars definitely didnt help because they frustrated me constantly. The adjustment knob kept moving and more importantly it's heavy as hell. definitely not something i would want hanging around my neck. It seems pretty great when it actually does work but the cons have drawn away my interest. The bino's have been sitting in my closet since December and that's probably where they'll stay until i get married, have kids, they have kids who come to visit and go through my old things."
94,The picture doesn't lie.  Look closely at the plugs.  This is a MONO cable.  Not stereo.  I needed a stereo audio cable.  oops.
95,"***Died in less than 30 days; no luck with getting manufacturer to replace or repair it***[my original review:]This DVD player (and CD player too) looks great, quite svelte and high tech. It has so far played any format I've thrown at it, and the video quality is nothing short of excellent. The audio outputs are adequate for most anyone's needs.I've had 2 Apex TVs for some time, and along with this DVD player, I must say they are very good performers at bargain basement prices."
96,"Most of the time I had very good luck with Amazon, but the last order of these cases, there were too many broken cases. Six of the first 15 were broke. I have not examined the other 35 cases. The discount on the Amazon Warehouse price is not that much less than the new cases. In the future I will buy only new boxes of DVD storage cases."
97,"So far, does what it is suppose to do. The quality does not seem to be excellent, but as long as it works"
98,"This mouse use to work well back in the day (2002) but now the newer mice have improved laser technology over these mice with the newer mouse pads.  It was good in it's hay day, but it has expired unfortunately."
99,"I've had these phones for 15 or 20 years, can't acctually remember.  I use them daily for long periods of listening and then I'll leave them for a while and go to the stuido speakers.  They still look like the same model they sell now. They are extremely accurate.  Will rip up a bad recording and make a good one sound everything it should.  The ear pads are vinyl, but under that on my was a terry cloth so I peeled the vinyl away about 15 years ago and they are more comfortable.  I haven't heard any phones that sound any better than this in my looking around.  If they give out after 20 or 30 years I'll get another pair in a heartbeat.  But this pair are like old blue jeans to me.  You won't be disappointed with this.  I think you would have to shop long and hard and spend lots more to get this quality in any other model or make."
100,I am an independent contractor for computer repair and this kit is more than adequate.  I do wish I had purchased the magnetized kit instead though.
101,I thought a dvd case is a dvd case but the plastic on this product is so thin and brittle that the little tags that hold the front and back together break off on half of the cases.  Next time I'll spend the extra money and hopefully have better luck.
102,My Radio Shack signal booster worked fine at nearly half the cost.  It has two outputs and a dial to control the amount of boost.  Save some dough.
103,"SONY has a default 90 day warranty. If you register online within 90 days(sugggest you use a spam attracting email address!) the warranty period is extended to 1 year. The web site service descriptions suggest that SONY isn't very strong in the service department, but we've not called.We've twice experienced a complete reset with total data loss on this device. Once might have been due to the battery cover coming loose. Watch that battery cover.Several users have commented that the text is very fine and hard to read. A Japanese developer has generously provided a fix for the world, the resulting fonts are quite readable. (ThinFontFix"
104,"Very disappointed with this purchase.  Their Tech Support was pretty good although they couldn't help with drivers for other software.  I wanted to capture some old VHS tapes.  The capture software supplied was poor, I had other capture software, but none would work with this card because Hauppuage doesn't have any drivers for other capture software .I had many other problems while trying to capture.  If I changed to full screen while capturing the software would change channels!I returned the card for a refund and I am looking at other cards."
105,"I imagine this would work very well, only I found a better way to make notes for stories, so it's sitting in a drawer like the Palm."
106,"Possibly the best headphone I have ever bought. The build quality is great, One complain the ear cushion can ware off easily but I third party replacements are available."
107,"First off, it feels cheap to just hold it in your hands. It lives up to that expectation: it worked fine a couple times then suddenly decided it would not stay closed with a VHS tape in it, so I had to hold it shut by hand for it to work. The latching mechanism wasn't too trustworthy to begin with, but it had no problems staying closed when it was empty, but that kind of defeats the point of the device.After reading reviews of this and other Kinyo devices, I don't know WHY ANYONE WOULD BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!"
108,"This is a pretty good deal on a Kodak 1-megapixel camera. What is a 1-megapixel camera you ask? Well, it's about the maximum resolution (the best) you would want for a digital camera whose main task will be taking pictures for emailing or website posting. Higher resolution makes for larger files which require not only more time to upload (i.e. to transfer to an email or to post on a website), but more time to download for your reader. In fact, the new 3-megapixel cameras make photo files so large that a person with a well-tuned 56k (regular modem) connection would have to wait almost 6 minutes to download (view) a single photo! This particular camera then is well-suited to internet apps, and you'll probably use it on lower than 1-megapixel resolution most of the time.  PROS: 1) Price 2) Quality  3) USB connection  4) CompactFlash (expandable) memory  5) Through-the-lens shooting. CONS: 1) Limited zoom (digital zooms are poor relatives of optical zooms)  2) High battery usage  3) Mediocre flash capability."
109,"Purchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing.  He likes to listen to music on an MP3 player while mowing the lawn.  These work well, he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise.  He is very please with them."
110,"Hi folks its Vince the Radioman . I have a large collection of radios and I love to do compares and share my thoughts. The ATS 909 and 606 , if you've seen my reviews are great buys and probably Sangeans best radios. The 505 is a very good buy for someone who want Single Side Band and can't spend a large amount of money .The 505 is the least expensive radio out there with side band and fine tuning( 1kh increments). The overall construction and quality of the build is ok at best and the radio is a little top heavy and bulky . The tuner sensativity is far better than the Grundig yb400 on AM and FM but on SW the 505 is about equal on its best day. The step down to 1 kh tuning is inconvenient where you need to push in the tuning dial to go to the fine tuning mode. The dynamic range and selectivity is good but the ATS 606 blows this radio away, same price , but the 606 has no SSB. The new Eton E 10 ( probably the best of the new Eton line for the money) also blows it away but no SSB. So , if you want SSB and a fairly decent radio for a low price this is a no brainer. If you want a mid-sized and priced radio for AM/SW and FM get the Eton E 10 or the SONY SW35 or the Sangean ATS 606."
111,"Pros:- In terms of sound quality, it is above-average in its class.- So very very comfy!Cons:- It sounds very weak on portable players. If you want headphones for you're mp3 or CD player, these are NOT a good choice.- Big- Yes, they sound good for cheap headphones. But they just don't sound as good as a pair of $100 headphones.Another thing worth mentioning - the cord is extremely long. This may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're using it for. Normaly I love long cords, but the cord in this is just ridiculously long.If you're in the market for computer or media system headphones, and want something you can wear all the time withought you're ears coming off, these are a great choice. If you want some better sounding headphones, and comfort isn't an issue, then I would recommend the Jensen JF25 Stereo Headphones."
112,"These headphones are a must buy. They are very comfortable and have really good sound. I use them for music, games, movies, and tv shows that I play on my computer and the sound is terrific. They have just the right amount of bass, and are really good for games especially. I would recommend these headphones to anyone. In order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if you're careless. Overall, these headphones are a great purchase and I will buy these again."
113,I like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my (large) head.  Good sound and comfortable enough :)  They seem well enough made.
114,"These are great for running or doing outdoor activities without being bulky. They sound great and are easy to wear and to store. I highly recommend for lightweight headphones, and they don't fall out of your ears like ear-buds always do. Good product!"
115,"it works, but it doesn't work flawlessly.  just like most of the other reviews say, this mouse makes for a jumpy cursor.  one second your in the middle of the screen, the next your in the upper left corner.  it's only once in a while, but still annoying.  go for a logitech instead."
116,"3rd set, what else can i say lol ... they have always been a little heavy on the base but as a work horse they are perfect"
117,It works well with mySennheiser HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channelingand my laptop's headphone input socket. however the 1/8th inch is a bit too narrow? not sure what's the word for it. but it easily slides out from the audio jack on my laptop. and sometimes it'd slip out without me intending to.
118,I am using this cable with a multiuse Brother printer. Been using it for 6 months now and it is working perfectly. Well built.
119,"I ordered this STEREO coupler as part of a solution I built to mount and connect my iPhone to my car stereo. Unfortunately, this unit, despite being billed as a stereo connector, was only working for the right channel. I replaced it with one from the local electronics store as it wasn't worth dealing with the return."
120,"Unfortunately, there is a grounding problem with these speakers.  The center channel just produces static.  I did some research and found this to be a common problem.When I emailed Creative tech support, their answer was to isolate the ground looping problem in my house.  I'm sorry, but I shouldn't have to rewire my house to get some speakers to work."
121,"I put it in my machine when the error read &#34;Head Cleaning Required!&#34;. After I used it, same message. Not a fan."
122,"Belkin 55-Piece Computer Tool Kit with Black CaseI have use this kit on a regular bases, for my electronic kits..Worth the price the quality of the tools."
123,"I went to a Handspring Prism after my Palm M500 (actually, two of them) stopped hotsynching.  Although it performs well and I really like the color display, there are two major drawbacks.  First, it is too bulky.  I thought this would not be a problem for me but unlike my Palm, I find myself somewhat bothered by the fact that it won't fit into my shirt pocket.  Second, the display washes out in sunlight and is difficult, almost impossible, to see.The Visor series is advertised as being ""infinitely expandable"", and it is.  The problem is that while there are currently more expansion options for Visor than for Palm, those options come at a rather steep price.  Furthermore, prospective buyers should also be aware that Handspring intends to get out of the personal digital assistant (PDA) market and concentrate on communicators such as its new Treo series.  This might dry up the expansion device market and make the modules even more expensive than they currently are.If you know what you're getting into, the Prism isn't a bad PDA.  Personally, I think the Visor Pro is a much better deal for the money.  Although it doesn't have a color display, it does feature 16mb of memory (to the Prism's 8mb) as well as a slightly thinner case, and costs about the same when you factor in the $50 instant rebate currently being offered by Handspring."
124,don't plan on using this printer with any Linux system - simply amazing that Kodak is incapable of accommodating simple LPD printing via TCP or UNIX spooling systems (CUPS would be preferred)
125,"These are quite flimsy.  They do work for your CD's or DVD's but they do not close very well and have a ""cheap"" feel to them.  I would recommend against these is you are getting into the case often."
126,"I wanted earphones that had some sort of storage device with it because I was getting tired of untangling my earphones and those little 'earphone bones' kept getting lost.  The storage is o.k., but not really what I was looking for (still in search of the perfect storage), but the earphones themselves are very disappointing.I read a review that said that the ear pieces were too big and painful.  I should have taken that review more seriously.  The sound quality is o.k., but I can't really use the earphones for any length of time before they start hurting my ear.  I only use them as an emergency spare pair."
127,"Have to turn up the volume on the amplifier to hear the sound. Muffles audio frequencies too much. Music sounds bad, loses most the high and low frequencies. Makes pop sounds. Not what was hoping for."
128,I have this plugged into both a PC (for media access) and the wall-wart power.... sometimes the high-Amp ports do not seem to keep my phone charging overnight when the PC goes to sleep. Odd since it is powered. Only happens few times a month.
129,"I've always gone the cheap route, and purchased $30 headsets that would last for a couple years and develop crackly sounds along the way.  Tiring of that in my middle age, I decided to spring for something a bit better, but first checked with Amazon's reviews.  This led me to the MDR-V600 headset, which was about $80.  Should have done it a long time ago...  Money well spent!  Excellent volume range, comfortable, covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output.  I used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while I do other things.  Occasionally to practice piano/keyboard.  Like I said, money well spent, although I have only had them a couple months.  Other reviewers give high marks for longevity, so I expect they will be satisfying for me as well."
130,"I am using this daily as a hardwired bridge between my modem and switch. It does the job very well, and seems to be a very quality cable. Can't go wrong with Belkin cables."
131,"It seems like a good product now that I have it up and running. I've been on wireless the past few months because my network card stopped responding and with this product, my connection is noticeably a lot more stable and faster.I almost returned the product, however, because I could not get the driver to install. I tried on 3 different relatively new laptops, two of which are Toshibas, and one of which is a Dell - all running Windows XP. As soon as you plug it in, it is recognized, but if you try to install the driver from the CD as suggested, it does not work. It says the driver is missing or corrupt. I tried pointing it to the actual file but that did not work either (by the way the manual is garbage - whoever typed it up never actually tested what they wrote. There are spaces missing in file destination paths).I got it working after going to the D-link website and downloading the driver there and pointing to the specific file myself.Kind of a hassle for me... it might be for you as well, so be wary of that.On a better note though, Amazon.com is great. I ordered late on a Sunday night - Monday was a national Holiday (Columbus Day), and I received it late tuesday afternoon. It wasn't supposed to arrive until next Monday with the Free Shipping I selected, but it only took a day and a half."
132,"I've only had them for a month, but so far I'm quite satisfied. They have a good sound, noticeably better than your bargain basement earbud. My main concern now is to see how durable they are, or if they break down after 2 months like a lot of earbuds. If they prove they can stand the test of time, my review would move up to 5 stars."
133,"This lens isn't something uber professionals would probably use, but for a novice like me with a Canon Rebel this lens has been great!"
134,"This product does not work properly.  I have to reboot the modem at least 2-3X a day as the connection is constantly lost.  It was cheap, but still a waste of my money."
135,"This unit was OK but not spectacular. It often did not read a disk IE: You had to re-insert them at times. When it worked it worked well though.Bottom line: After a year and three months this unit has quit working. It will not read any disk that is inserted. It cannot be used as a paperweight because it is too light LOL. I paid a low price and got what I paid for I guess.If I were purchasing another DVD player or any other electronic item I'd shy away from Norcent - or is that AVorcent (Notice the ""N"" in Norcent's products is composed of the letter ""A""and then the letter ""v"" to look like an ""N""That was the coolest thing about this unit. Now I'm going to put my old Toshiba DVD back into service."
136,"My sister's Bose headphones finally died and so, her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the high-end stuff, i gave her my JVC HA-RX700 and she loves them even more than the Bose. So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly ""bother"" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can't imagine headphones getting that much better. i've heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me."
137,"Seriously, what are you expecting for $10?  These are super cheap and super crappy.  Save your money and spend $20 and get a higher quality product."
138,"After breaking my fourth headphone after 2 weeks, I can no longer recommend these headphones.I would recommend the Sony MDR 25G S2 sports headphone WITHOUT the folding option.  The folding joints break too easily.If you do order them, you should order multiple copies as you will need them.  Or, be VERY careful each time you fold and unfold them...That said, these are great sports headphones.  They are great for high sweat activites like running and allow enough ambient noise in to hear approaching hazards behind and around you.  These headphones are far superior to the earbud types out there for athletic activity."
139,"I really hate this design as it's really awkward but I guess you can get used to it.  However, by the time you get used to it, it will start making your thumb hurt after extensive use.  But IF you have severe issues with regular or ergo mice, this is OK to use I guess."
140,I bought these headphones for my dad...they do the job  but1.the phones don't fit easily on the base to charge ..a bit tricky  you have to move them around until you get the right position & the charging light turns on2.you have to face the transmitter if you move your head to the side .. static takes overwould not recommend..if you want something reliable and good buy other headphones
141,"I have tested Bose Around Ear Headphones (not the noise canceling version) and my Sony MDR-V6 beat Bose by far!Bose got a softer cushion and better response in the very low frequency at 16Hz, but Sony are far more consistent with the output level throughout the entire response range.20-20000 hz on Sony sound all at almost the same level - very nice flat response Sony have indeed. It will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering - you can hear them all on Sony's. But with Bose the bass will sound better and that is it - nothing else!I am so happy I got the MDR-V6 instead of Bose! (When I got my Sony both were almost same price.)"
142,"I've been trying to find one of these adapters that would work on either or both of my Dell servers (PE T105 and PE SC440) which are controlled by a KVM switch with PS/2 connections.  After waiting a couple of weeks for shipping from Hong Kong, this adapter would not work on either system.  I even tried it on an Asus MB in my self-built HTPC and it was nogo on that unit as well.  I have found a couple of adapters that do work on all of these systems and have been trying to source a 3rd so I can quit swapping the working ones around.  The item is too inexpensive to send back as the postage will exceed the cost."
143,"It works just like a piece of wire, not even worth my time to send it back."
144,Name brand and quality build.  I use it on a Canon 'L' series lens without degrading the image.  I would recommend it to a friend
145,"I use this 256M Xd Olympus for my C5050. taking pictures is good and comparable to the 256M compact flash with about half of the price tag. Ater downloaded the pictures to my computer, the card went poopy!!(card error and cannot be able to reformated) I used the same Sandisk card reader as for my compact flash card! I used the other reader (computer built in), well I fried another 64M Xd fujifilm. Performance may be! but reliable, I don't think so. Giving a 2 is too generous !!!"
146,I use this on my 18-55mm kit lens and it works well with no issues. Tiffen is known for making decent quality filters.
147,"About the only thing Bose has going for it is pretty packaging...the sound, build, and electronic quality is mediocre at best given its outrageous price point.My sister refused my advice and bought this system.  Then I bought her a cheapo JBL powered sub and cheapo JBL satellites which cost about the same...and she was stunned!  I just felt bad for Best Buy, they had to absorb the loss."
148,"Specifically purchased IR to limit range. Had RF conflict with neighbor.This thing is horrible compared the superb Sennheiser RF headphones. Tinny audio, constant loud hissing.Occasional loud ""pops"".Earcups are spring loaded on the headband. They keep riding up to the top of my ears.Second Review:Have had these just under two years. Left earcup speaker has failed. Junk."
149,"I have a collection of headphones, but now by far this is my favorite, very comfortable in long use. Highly recommended. On the go they are lightly and when not in use, they fit in the pocket of my regular jacket. I love them, the sound is crystal clear. And for that price nobody can beat them."
150,"Okay, first off, the battery life is arguably the worst I've ever seen.  I think a non-waterproof watch at the bottom of a pool might run longer than this thing.  But I'm in no mood to test that.Secondly, the playlist navigation is almost a joke.  When in random mode or shuffle mode (yes, those are two seperate modes - how novel), skipping forward plays a new and completely unexpected song.  Good.  Skipping backwards however does NOT play the last song you heard.  No, it's essentially exactly the same as pressing the forward key.  What?!  Who thought this up?If you're thinking that isn't all that annoying - how about this?  If you shift from &quot;random&quot; or &quot;shuffle&quot; mode to &quot;once&quot; mode during song play, the device completely forgets what the heck is going on.  It will continue to play the active song, but display on the LCD panel the very first song on your playlist.  Next, it will play the second song, and the screen will catch up to itself.  Completely unacceptable.  It should continue to play AND DISPLAY the active song, and then proceed in order through your playlist from that point.Sigh.  Using this thing drives me crazy.  And mastering it's operation is almost self-defeating.  As you get better at being familiar with the intricacies of how to navigate the device, you can quickly advance to the point of being faster than the device.  Key response time needs help, and desperately.But, all in all, what do I think?  Well, I love it.  I mean, as long as I don't touch it or look at it, it's great.  It was designed to be listened to, and for that, well, wow, it really excells.  Songs sound amazing, and the idea of leaving my apartment with every CD I own, all in my pocket .. well, c'mon now .. that's just darn cool.  Creative needs desperately to get their act together with the firmware, but the hardware itself is definately worth the price."
151,"I purchased these three years and four months ago, they still sound as good as day one. All sound is crisp and clear.  They are comfortable for many hours. I got them for sixty -six bucks. The ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so I bought replacements, for eight bucks. Hope to get many more years service out of them."
152,"As a warning, when used with a standard, 2-outlet wall box, this surge protector will block both outlets in all scenarios."
153,Item received in this order was not in good working order and was more difficult to use than the same item previously purchased.
154,"The SportaPro has a dirty little secret.The Sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the KSC35, but instead of attaching the KSC35's clips, they attached the SportaPro headband. Here's my head-fi review 'snippet' of the KSC-35 which IS the same as the Sportapro:KSC-35, the more mature Koss clip-on that was discontinued and then brought back (only on the Koss website), for a pretty hefty $45. I'd say it's hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the KSC75 range, not 3x as much. They sound very similar to the KSC75. However, they are fuller sounding, with fuller bass approaching full-sized type bass, and the mids/vocals are very rich and forward. Treble is also quite neutral for me, not being too smooth, and not too sparkly. I actually am quite fond of their treble. The KSC75's treble is harsher, grainier, and more fatiguing. The mids on the KSC75 are slightly laid back, while the KSC35 presents them up front and more fleshed out. In all honesty, you can say the difference between the KSC75 and KSC35 is like the difference between the K701 and Q701. One is brighter, drier, and thinner sounding, while the other is more natural, and fleshed out.All in all, it's a solid sounding headphone, that does work very well. Bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones, but slower than the KSC75. Based on sound alone, I'd say the KSC35 is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue. Kind of like a smaller, more bassy HD650. Nice tonal balance that I don't think anyone would dislike.The Koss Sportapro houses the same drivers as the KSC35, for less than half the price. You can literally buy the Sportapro, snap off the drivers, and snap the KSC75/35 clips on to the Sportapro drivers, and you have a cheaper KSC35. Ideal solution is getting the Sportapro and KSC75, putting the KSC75 clips onto the Sportapro drivers. This will save you $10, give you BOTH the KSC35 and KSC75 as a spare, and give the most comfort, IMHO. Just make sure to bend the KSC75 clips to place the drivers closer to the ears, as stock form may place the drivers too far, losing bass and overall sound quality.The more popular alternative, is to buy the cheap Parts express headphone (http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Stereo-Lightweight-Headphones-feet/dp/B0002KQZJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1371458925&sr;=1-1&keywords;=parts+express+headphones), taking off the crappy drivers, and using the headband for the Koss drivers. I prefer the Koss clips rather than the Parts Express headband, but I'm in the minority."
155,The cable is good for short range network assembly. Definitely better that a Cat 5 or 5e. I used it between my Modem and router.
156,"I decided to upgrade my SLR camera. I've had a Canon T-50 for about 14 years and really liked it but now I would like to do some more creative things with the aperature and shutter speeds whereas the T-50 didn't have any controls for creativity but was a great point and shoot SLR.This camera is much bigger than my T-50 but has tons more features. I just love auto focus now. This camera lets you focus on whatever your eyes look at and focuses quickly and quietly. And film transport is basically silent compared to the T-50 which is so loud that whenever I would take a photo the noise would draw everyone's attention.The lens that comes with this is the lower end but is USM (Ultra Sonic) and is fine for point and shoot and does have a nice wide angle and fairly good zoom (90mm).This camera isn't quite as solid as my T-50 as that camera could be tossed around and held up beautifully over the years but this camera needs more TLC as it is more plasticy but considerably better than Canon's other SLRs (excluding the higher ended EOS's such as EOS 1D and EOS 3).The flash is adequate for most close up purposes but suggest an external one for large groups at a distance where you can also set the angle of the flash.Over all this is a fun camera. Has so many features to experiment with. And the tracking focus is awesome for photographing anything moving fast such as cars, horses, etc.I'd recommend it to anyone and prices seem to have dropped since it was introduced. Enjoy!!"
157,"It works with my Epson scanner, but my Canon i960 printer didn't like it. Computer didn't have a clue the printer was turned on.  However, I don't know if that is an issue with this hub or the printer.  The printer works fine plugged directly into my computer, though."
158,"Well, I am not a bass friend but I would like to get more bass from this ear.IMHO, this earphone is over-rated. This is a very popular and good earphone and it get a broad recognized. I am a music friend who writes electronic equipments test report. I deal with many music players and earbuds. This earphone is good for those people who enjoy pure music. If you love R&B; and Rap... A Sony one with close price would be your choice.This earphone is also getting a high recognition in some Chinese forums (I'm from China so I know it), but I guess it is just a good choice due to its cheaper price and acceptable quality. Generally if you good for price and you do not care much about bass, this would be a good choice.I am buying another MX-400 from Sennheiser and I will let you guys know how I think about that one later on."
159,"Bought these head phones for my wife. She uses them when she flies, they fold up nice and they have better sound quality  than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive. Next ones i buy will be the sony's"
160,"For the price this bag is great! Because of the size of todays handycams, digital cameras, cell phones,etc. you'll find they can all fit into this one bag, which makes it easy to carry them all(& carry on airplane) when on vacation."
161,I have a trendnet wireless router and like it. figurd this would be similar features minus WIFI.it was so wrong. the filtering options on this are the worst Ive ever seen. This is pathetic.  i am a network administrator and planned to use this as a simple gateway for a wireless camera system that has its own RF receiver.Really useless. Ended up getting an old Linksys router and disabling wifi and installing DD-WRT.
162,"I no longer own this lens - I have replaced it with Canon's EF 180m MacroOptically this is an excellent lens, the focus speed is very good (better than the 180mm) - it is quite light and easy to hand hold. It also makes a very nice general purpose short telephoto.However for small shy creatures it lacks sufficient 'stand off' distance resulting in missed opportunities - it also is not compatible with Canon's teleconverters.My biggest issue with this lens was the optional tripod ring - it comes with a plastic sleeve that fits around the lens to which the tripod ring attaches - I found this system inefficient - it was stiff in operation and fragile.  As most of my Macro photography is shot from a tripod this was a big issue"
163,"These fit great and look good but need a volume control and some real speakers. The sound quality is very poor, it sounds like your in a tin can. You get what you pay for"
164,"I purchased these for sport use, and compared them with a set of Sennheiser earbuds I use at the office. The Sonys are a little more expensive, but they have better sound, more bass response, and fit my ears better. Although I'm a fan of Sennheiser products, in this case the Sony product is superior."
165,"The card worked great but the software included for capture [stunk].  I think it's the same with all cards, they always give you the ... software for free.  In this case, it was the Ulead Video Studio software, but the 'SE' version, not the good stuff.But as for the card, I just put it in, booted back to Windows XP, it detectd the card and away I went.  I didn't even need to give it my driver CD.Since it included a firewire cable, I didn't have to purchase one either."
166,"The initial release of this router was very unreliable.  Recently, Linksys released a new firmware - version 1.67.  I have loaded it and have had better luck with this firmware than when I first got it.The initial firmware would not connect to my ISP.  It also had to be rebooted daily to allow the wireless network card on my laptop to connect to it.This could be a 3, possibly 4, star review.  However, I have not had version 1.67 firmware long enough to see if Linksys / Cisco got the major issues fixed.  Proceed with caution."
167,"Bought this because I was going to be putting a new PC together, which involved a lot of parts moving around.  I don't have a good floor for this, so the wrist band was a must.  I'd rather not take my chances with having to touch metal every so often.The strap fits well, and the cord seems to stretch far enough for my needs.  However, the only problem I've noticed is that the teeth are not as grippy as they could be.  I've had them fall off many a time from just reach a few inches past the tower, which becomes a bother after the 6th or 7th time.  Oh well, it was cheap and it works.  Can't complain too much."
168,"I got this antenna after borrowing a directional Philips PHDTV3 antenna from a friend. Despite getting pretty mediocre reviews on Amazon, that one got pretty good reception in my apartment, but only in one direction (as it was designed to do). This antenna from Terk is multi-directional, so it gets a lot more channels, but only a couple of them are coming in 100% clear. This product had such positive reviews that I expected it to perform at least as well as the antenna with poorer reviews. One of these weekends when it bugs me enough, I'll probably try moving it around some more to see if there's a better spot, but it's so big that there aren't many places I can put it."
169,I use this lens on the Canon Digital Rebel. It gives me great color &amp; sharpness up to 11x14. Canon makes better lens than this but for this price range you can't beat it. I'd reccommend it to any one. If I lost this one today I'd order another one tomorrow.
170,"Am not sure if everyone has the same view, but the one that I got from the market place seller - could be moved only in two directions, and the third direction is almost not movable at all.The plastic is cheap material, but thats what we get for the price. However, its unacceptable that the tripod doesnt enable us to move in the direction that it has to.Easy to carry, but only a limited 2-way movement possible."
171,"This cable replaced a new cheaper one that would not stay connected. The materials that make up the Belkin are of very good quality, the cable works flawlessly."
172,"The sound that these headphones reproduces is simply amazing. Right away I was astonished by the vast details, crisp vocals and all the little details that was intended to be heard by the artist!For under $100, this is one of the best in that price range, it even sounds better than some higher priced headphones!This definitely sounds better than my Beats, and Bose headphones!These headphones are also very comfortable, feels much more durable than Beats and Bose.Based on other reviews, it seems that these headphones will last a long time!Buy it, don't hesitate, you won't regret it! :)"
173,"Anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note: they were designed and advertised for DJ use specifically.  And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours."
174,the image was misleading. i actually wanted black cords but instead they were white. not a big deal because they work properly and they were shipped to me on time but i think they should make the buyers aware that the picture is not exact.
175,"Buy them. Light, comfortable and great sound. I will say that I was disappointed at first. Initially they are too (painfully) bright, but after about 30 hours I was really impressed."
176,"Wow. Maxtor is terrible. Following all of their instructions to the letter, I attempted to copy my Win2K SP4.0 system disk (20GB) onto this newer, larger drive. The first attempt took 2 hours and failed at 95% completion. When I attempted to perform the copy from within Win2K, it took another 2+ hours to complete. Everything appeared fine until I attempted to boot off the new drive. NOTHING.Yes...NOTHING. No recognized boot volume.WORSE YET...my original system disk was totally corrupted. My recently made repair disk failed. For every fixed file, there was another one waiting. After several nights of trying every trick possible (including analyzing the system on another win2K machine), I have given up.The drive itself works...so maxtor gets a 1 star. But their software violated the PRIME DIRECTIVE: DO NO HARM.I have written to Maxtor several times. Eventually, a human responded and said &quot;The warranty says we are not responsible for any incidental or direct data loss&quot;. TRANSLATION: MAXTOR does not care what happens when you use their software!!!! Not only did they cost me &gt;24 hours of my LIFE, they refuse to compensate me in any way for their faulty software that corrupted my original (perfectly fine) system disk!Well, if they don't care how messed up your data is going to get, why would I care to buy their products in the future."
177,"I used these for biking. They were ok for a few days, minimal wind noise, but the left side just stopped working after less than 4 hours of use."
178,"My wife and I have been using a meditation program for over a year (Holosync) and these headphones are recommended by the company to use if you want to enhance the listening experience. We had good results using just earbuds and more advanced listening devices aren't necessary until you get to advanced levels of the program, but we decided we'd give them a try. They were also much cheaper from Amazon than buying from Centerpointe.They really have improved the listening experience. I have some slight hearing loss and these headphones allow me to hear a greater range of sound without having to turn the volume up too high. The headset is very lightweight and comfortable for the bulk of it. The cord is long and dangling and is really too much for an iPod (which of course they're not really made for anyway), but it's easy to reign in when necessary.If you get them, keep in mind that the bigger connector plug can be unscrewed to reveal the more common mini plug.Over all we give them two thumbs up!"
179,"In my experience Tiffen makes a very good filter and this one is no exception. Threads match nicely and the filter seats firmly yet is easily removed. The rotation of the filter is buttery smooth and stays put. The Tiffen adds a nice degree of polarization that gives colors a bit more saturation and contrast with a minor loss of overall transmission. If you're not shooting with a polarizing filter you probably don't realize just how much stray/reflected light is affecting your photo's. Once you see the difference a good filter like this can make you'll wonder why you didn't start using one sooner. Put your UV filter back in the bag and put something in front of your lens that will actually improve every shot. I've spent bigger money on other brands of filter (Hoya, B&W, et al) and I just don't see that money buying me a better filter. Maybe I'm missing something but, ""the proof of the pudding is in the eating"" and Tiffen filters do the job for me without breaking my budget."
180,"three and a half years and dead.  plus the fact that everytime the printer thought the ink cartridges were empty, it would quit printing and you cannot empty them completely.  no more expensive printers for me.;"
181,"It's a circular polarizer, a pretty good one too.  This particular one takes about 1 to 2 stops out of your exposure.  I use it for the ND effect sometimes.  No problems with it on my Nikon 80-200 or 24-70."
182,"I've owned an iRiver ifp series player for over a year. I've been pleased in general with their operation except for the issue that when the unit breaks (which yours may or may not) iRiver has no facilities to repair a unit beyond its warranty period.On the plus side:+ Small size+ Long battery life with single AA battery.+ No OEM battery that can't be replaced+ Audio good, and EQ settings very flexible+ Many changable option features+ Software can be flash upgradedOn the negative side:- The software for loading the device is only fair. The unit can supposedly be modified by software to act as an external drive, but I have not tried this.- The need for an external cable is a hassle, nicer if it could just plug into a USB port without a cable- FM radio is not very sensitive. Only local stations are heard. The earphone cord is the antenna, so this accounts for the lack of sensitivity. The stereo decoding takes about 10db more signal so only strong signals will be heard in stereoBut, I bought this unit as an MP3 player, so the FM aspect isn't that important.NOW... FOR THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH IRIVER.....I had my unit for a little over a year. One day, while playing music, the unit just quit, and the display went dead. Checking for the obvious problems, like a dead battery, nothing seemed to be wrong with the unit EXCEPT that it wouldn't turn on or do anything.I sent multiple emails to iRiver and received no reply. I called their 800 number, and was informed that ""they do not have a servive center, and make no repairs of the flash players""I cannot give any higher rating than two stars to a company that charges $150-200 for a product and then expects it to just be thrown away as they don't service their product.Apparently, if the unit is still in warranty, they can send out a new unit as a replacement, but beyond the warranty period, you're out of luck as iRiver won't touch the unit.Buy iRiver at your own risk."
183,"As far as picture quality and ease of use go the Fuji FinePix 4900 is by far one of the best digital cameras you can buy. Fuji probably discontinued this model though because the battery only lasts about 45 minutes to an hour if used with the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). If you use the EVF (Electronic View Finder) the battery will last longer, the LCD just looks cooler is all. The software that comes with this camera is also very user-friendly and appears to be compatible with all OS's. Overall an excellent digital camera!!!! Extra batteries can be bought through the following web site. --> [...]"
184,"I recently purchased this headset and all I can say is 'ech'.  The distance doesnt go farther then 7-10 feet and the slightest obstical infront of the signal cuts you off.  I put a peice of paper between me and the transmitter and the signal just cut off.  the range it broadcasts in is around a 100 degree radius in front, NOTHING can be heard to the direct sides or back of the transmitter.  I just cannot believe how lousy the signal.* Lets you enjoy music while roaming around the house or yard (As long as your house IS your yard with no walls and facing directly in front of it)* System has 24-foot range and lasts up to 35 hours( More like 7-10 feet)* Simple battery recharging  (Yea this is true)* High-powered ferrite magnets generate superb sound (Sound is very nice)* Weighs 6.3 ounces(bout right)All in all I am dissapointed with this device.  I have used it both at home and at work with same results, lousy signal"
185,"That's what these headphones create for me.  The sound quality is nothing less than awesome, from deep, well-defined bass to clear mid-range (Sade, Billy Joel and Etta James just sound divine!) to sharp (but not overbearing) highs.  The dynamic range is astounding...you'll hear little details in songs you never noticed before.I'm sure you could find better headphones, for a lot more money. But unless you have the hearing of a dog, you're not going to notice enough of a difference to make the extra hundred dollars or so worth your while.  If you're willing to spend some dough, but not wanting to pay a mint, these are highly recommended.My only caveat is that the fit is a little snug.  In a way it's good, because it helps keep background noise out without the distortion that noise cancellation can introduce.  These are ideal for noisy environments where you want to be alone with your sound.  But I could see where individuals with wider than average heads might experience a bit of discomfort with prolonged use.  If I take my glasses off while wearing these headphones, I generally have to take the headphones off to put my glasses back on.  But then again, eyeglasses and headphones are always an awkward mix."
186,"In the end, if a pair of heaphones is uncomforable to wear like the Sony MDR-V150s are to me, the sound doesn't really matter.  The only reason I gave two stars is perhaps these do fit some people OK; but I could not wear these for over 15 - 20 minutes without discomfort."
187,"My first complaint is that the ""instructions"" that came with the product are useless and the diagram of parts doesn't match what's in the box.  My unit has a single wire FM antenna that I had hoped to improve upon but the Terk antenna comes with a live and ground wire connection.  My unit does not have a 75 Ohm coaxial cable connection so the little red thing with the two wires sticking out (unlabeled) is useless and the connection attached directly to the antenna unit doesn't seem to fit any of my unit's connections.  Would be helpful if Terk had specified the connections needed to connect the antenna.  This will just go into the trash."
188,"I bought this DVD player in July 2003 and enjoyed it until Apr 2005, when it stopped working with a ""HO2 - NO DISC"" error.It turns out that premature death is a common problem with this player. A search on ""Panasonic DVD-S35"" and ""NO DISC"" will bring up these reviews.Reviewers share a common complaint -- the player is great for the first year, and then dies (I got 18 months out of mine).I strongly advise that you do not buy one of these used, as it is unlikely to last even a full year.--Pat"
189,"It's Cat 5 cable as advertised, and cheaper than anything else you will find. Just the length I needed for wiring part of a small system of networked computers and similar in performance to other Cat 5 cables in the same ecosystem. I don't particularly care for the clips on each jack, they are not horrible but are a bit twitchy to plug in and unplug. Not a huge deal, but the one less than ideal aspect of this cable. Can't really complain too much about it for the price."
190,"My 3rd trip into the facinating world of Personal Digital devices.  My 1st was a dismal failure (I don't want to go into it for fear I may weep onto my keyboard -- again), my 2nd was my Palm M125, and now my Visor Platinum.  At first, I figured just by the looks of it, this was going to be my PDA of choice -- but after the initial surprise (I was given this device by a friend for my birthday) I found that yes, this IS a very good product, but is it better than my M125?  Nope.  They cost roughly the same, have 8MB of memory...both are upgradable...fast...but for MY personal tastes, the M125's smaller size was actually a better selling point for me.  Plus it has Palm OS 4.0, a small but significant improvement over the Visor.  Sure the screen is smaller (some would say too much) but for me this is in NO WAY a problem.  The screen is crisp and very sharp, and I haven't had a problem with viewing it in different lighting conditions.  The basic advantage (for me anyway) of the M125 over the Platinum is it sits more comfortably in my hands, and it's smaller size makes it easier to carry and use...not to mention the multiple faceplates that Palm offers as well as other accessories, hands down I find myself using it more than my Visor.Okay, enough of the downside.  If size IS a problem for you, then maybe the Platinum could be your next handheld.  Personally I'd go with the less expensive Visor Deluxe, which does basically everything the Platinum does, but for about $70.00 cheaper.  But again, that is up to you.  If you are already familiar with a Palm device, getting used to pretty much ANY Visor product will be a walk down the same pathway (for the most part, anyway).  They both use the exact same graffiti script and, with small exceptions, set up virtually identical.A quick note, Handspring plans to slowly (but surely) cut back on their production of PDA's and begin to market cell-phone/PDA's as they work to become a communications company.  They will be introducing their TREO phone/PDA any day now (if not already) and they are nifty items, but again, the cost is prohibitive (for now anyway) for many folks who just cannot afford to have a 2-in-1 product such as this.  Personally, I've found that my cell phones wear out the more often I use it, and if I handle my cell phone as much as I handle my PDA, I simply cannot see it paying off in the end (but that is just MY opinion).  I feel the more you know, the easier it is to make a decision...and when it comes to PDA's and what is availble versus the cost, the more information you have the better.  Good luck."
191,The wheels have lumps that cause the video camera to jump very slightly as you slide.  Not good for professional looking shots.
192,"I""m just an average guy who likes listening to music.  I also use them for privacy when watching tv in a ""full house"".  I'll let the audiophiles give the specs/high & lows/bass & treble reviews.  I bought these to replace my jbl-610's (see my review of those).  Yes I understand those were bluetooth and these are not.  I really didn't care that they were ""wire only"".  These headphones are VERY comfortable.  The giant earpads engulf your ears.  The leather (or what i'm guessing is leather) is very smooth.  I'm hoping for some durability there but I can't attest to it so early after purchase.  They are big enough that I don't have to extend the ear pads at all.  The headpiece is soft but solid.  No worries there.  I use mine at the desk so the cord is plenty long enough for me.  I haven't had them on a plane so I can't say how they will do on blocking out noise but I'm hopeful..... I'll update on that as it happens.  One last common man observation, and maybe I missed it in Amazon's description, the plug is a standard stereo sized plug but you can unscrew is and underneath is a 3.5mm plug.  Anyway really like them and for the price, you can't go wrong."
193,"I bought this DVD Player last Christmas.  I'm not technically knowledgeable about what all is available in DVD technology.  I did some research, liked what this model offered, and purchased it.  Being not technically knowledgeable, I appreciated the ease of set-up and use.  I have been using it for 7 months now and am very happy with it.  I've read comments about some people being unhappy with the noise the player makes, but I have not noticed any such noise.  The unit is quiet and easy to operate."
194,"The Kensington Expert Mouse is a high-end trackball mouse that I'm tempted to call my favorite mouse on the market (when it's working!) - However, I cannot recommend it.I have been using this mouse eight hours a day for 2-3 years as a medical transcriptionist, and unfortunately it has been replaced three times (for free) through Kensington's warranty on account of the left click and/or scroll wheel breaking.The left click button will work fine anywhere between 1-4 months, but then it slowly begins to function incorrectly. For example, I can try highlighting a paragraph from the top left to bottom right while holding the left click button down, and unfortunately the mouse acts as if I have released my finger from the left click button when in actuality I have not. This issue affects any type of clicking and dragging of icons on your desktop, and any event where you are intentionally holding the left click button to move something. Once the problem crops up, it persists and worsens. From there on out, holding the left click button will be interrupted and the mouse will ""drop"" whatever you're trying to highlight or click & drag EVERY TIME it's attempted.The other issue I had with this mouse was with the scroll wheel simply deciding not to scroll at all for a minute or two and then it would resume scrolling as usual. This happened repeatedly for about two weeks before I decided the mouse needed replacing.Both of these issues persisted after turning the computer on and off, reinstalling Kensington's ""TrackBall Works"" for Mac, and before/after upgrading to OS X 10.7 Lion operating system. I also use Windows by way of Parallels and all of these issues persisted in both operating systems.Although Kensington provided great support by replacing this mouse three times for free, it's time for me to move on and find a mouse that will function correctly long-term. I will be avoiding Kensington products from this point on."
195,"Did a lot of research with Consumer Reports on vcr's as we're in the market for a second one.  They don't rate any of them &quot;excellent&quot; and only a few get &quot;very good.&quot;  I think this reflects the industry's investment in these machines - just aren't putting the quality into them any more.  That being said, this machine works okay for my purposes.  So far, no troubles (only 2 months old), it's fairly easy to use, and I do like the &quot;commercial advance&quot; and index features.  Also, it's fairly compact."
196,for the price you will not find a better pair. sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say
197,"Price is good for an entry level lens but personally I really disliked it. I returned it after taking a couple test photos, the focusing with the lens is in my opinion is louder than acceptable. I returned this and purchased the 50mm f1.4 lens."
198,"Although the switch itself has a ""lifetime"" warranty, the power adapter is only warrantied  for two years. Our failed after about 2.5 years, and Netgear charges $27.00 for a replacement with is close to 50% of the cost of the switch."
199,"Worked for a while, web interface is junk (looks like it was made with Frontpage). Stopped working after a while, can't seem to be able to get back in using any of my admin passwords.Can't reset the password anyway.Stay away from this piece of garbage!"
200,"These V6's sound amazing. Especially for the price. I purchased them &#34;used&#34; from Amazon warehouse and I can't tell them from a brand new pair. I compared the sound quality against a set of $300 Bose QC 15's that I have for my many business trips and the Sony's sound significantly better. Of course, they are not noise cancelling, so I will still use the QC15 for trips. But for listening around the house or at the office, hands down I would use the V6s."
201,"Description of this product is incorrect.  This teleconverter will ONLY MOUNT TAMRON LENSES ON A CANON CAMERA BODY!!!!The instructions included with the teleconverter specification notes state ""This device is designed specifically for use with Tamron lenses. It is not compatible with other lenses.""This is in direct conflict with the Amazon description ""Tamron  AF 2X Teleconverter for Canon mount lenses""I am in the process of returning the teleconverter.  It was very disappointing Xmass present."
202,"So I was hoping this would work with my Mac, and it has a very bare bones functionality. It can transfer data, but it is extremely slow and the installation instructions say that it is only compatible with OS X 10.4 - 10.6, which would have been nice to know BEFORE purchasing. If you are looking for a cheap alternative to the Apple version, this is NOT it for newer Macbooks. Plus, the TRENDnet site doesn't have the Mac driver on the site, so you are forced to use an external optical drive to use the in box CD."
203,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago.  They fit very well and sound good, and if that were all I would give them four or five stars.  I paid close to $40 dollars for them (not through Amazon).  However, they suffer from one major defect:  the insulation around the very flexible cord has failed.  The reason?  Well I think they cannot withstand the heat as found in a closed car during the summer.  After doing that once, the cord started to feel ""gummy"" and started to stick together.  The cord never recovered and now the insulation has broken in several places.  You could say this is my fault; however I think this device should be designed to withstand these sorts of temperatures.  I live in the Northeast...I can't imagine that these will fare any better in the South or anywhere else it gets hot.There are two other more minor ""problems"" with these headphones.  First, without the extension they are very short.  They are good for an armband mp3 player, but you'll need the extension for anything else.  Second, I use them when I work out (and sweat).  I found that once in awhile they ""clog up"" and stop working and need to be dried out.  This may happen with any in-ear design...so I don't know if this is specific to Sony's design."
204,I have a more expensive microsoft optical mouse at home and I really like it. I decided to buy a second one for work to replace my mechanical mouse and decided to go with the cheapest version becuase how different can they be.Well it turns out that they are very different. I have no problems with the speed and accuracy but the mouse itself is so light that the cable pull becomes really annoying and you feel that you are constantly fighting it.Next time I will spend a little more to get the one model up.
205,"I have two sets of these headphones - one has been my companion in my gym bag for about 15 years, and the other has gone traveling with me over many trips in my computer bag as well as used frequently at home.I probably have a dozen pair of good to excellent headphones, including various sennheisers, grado sr 60, shure, super.fi pro 6, sony mdr v6 and v300, etc.Honestly these Porta Pros do not offer the best sound quality in the world.  But they might be the most comfortable.  And the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small.  They are easy to carry around, and I have found them to be surprisingly durable.By comparison I also have the Sennheiser PX 100s.  The Sennheisers are OK, but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled.  I always go back to the Porta Pros.  In fact, no matter what ever headphones I try I always go back to the Porta Pros.These have been around a long time, but no one has yet made a better portable headset.  Usually I don't like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review.  But these headphones are that good, and I recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp3 player."
206,"I've owned several types of clip on earphones in the past decade and this is possibly the worst I've tried.  First off, the clip doesn't swivel.  It's a static piece of plastic without a hinge.  This makes it difficult to put on my ear (maybe I have big ears?).  This also makes it tough to put on the clip with one hand.On the plus side, when it does go on it's clipped on tight and doesn't move.  One thing that sort of made up for the uncomfortable clip on mechanism was the really cushy foam speaker.  The foam cover on each headphone was soft and yielding, so it made the fit quite snug without feeling like my ear was being clipped off.  Still, I prefer the looser fit and easy-on convenience of a hinged clip.  Other models of clip on headphones strike a better balance of being easy putting on, staying on, and staying comfortable.The sound quality is my biggest problem.  I listen to a lot of spoken word audiobooks and podcasts on my commute to work.  The sound seemed muffled and quiet even when I maxed out my ipod volume.  When listening to music, the sound had pretty strong highs and decent lows, but the mid range was a bit soft.  Again, I had to max out my ipod volume to match the same loudness i get from 50%-70% volume with other headphones. When walking down crowded streets the surrounding noise often drowns out what's playing in these headphones.Finally, the bulk of these things is another issue.  They're significantly larger in diameter than other clip on headphones.  If other headphones are about 1.25 inches across, these are about 2 incheas across.  At their thickest point, they're about 3/4 of an inch.  There are much thinner clip ons out there.  Panasonic has a slim model (which used to be about $6 on amazon but has gone up since they've been discontinued) that's a much better size, sound quality, and clip style.I've only had these headphones for a couple days now, but i have used them enough to know that i don't like them.  I will probably return them and try a different pair.  I've had better luck with Sony and Panasonic.  If you like a really snug fit, don't mind a bulky headphone, and don't mind a quieter headphone with good highs/lows then these might work for you."
207,"When this camera focuses accurately the resulting images are really amazing.  However, a vast majority of approximately 1000 pictures we've taken so far are out of focus.  Switching to center-point focus doesn't help.  If only one feature on a camera works it should be the auto-focus.  Do the five-star reviewers have low standards, or is my camera defective?  I noticed one other review that mentions terrible focusing ability, so I don't think it's just me.On the brighter side, the movie mode is surprisingly good and produces nice, sharp movies.  However, zooming is not possible in movie mode.  My five-year-old, 0.8 megapixel Sony Mavica allows zooming in movie mode.  C'mon Canon.  Get with the program.Battery life is good and charging time is brief.  I don't have a backup battery or the AC adapter kit and I haven't had any reason to need them yet.The flash is nice and bright and allows for pretty decent indoor photos even in relatively low-light situations.  The AF-assist light probably could have been left off the camera altoghther.  If you need it to focus in really low-light you don't have a good chance at getting a good picture.  Don't expect any red-eye reduction from it either (same AF-assist light stays on during image capture when red-eye reduction feature is on).  In fact, unless your subject is willing to incur retinal damage by looking directly into the stunningly bright light, there is no real chance of reducing red-eye at all.  Big disappointment.  Canon needs to utilize the strobe-flash technique for red-eye reduction.Bottom line:  It's easy to look at the very best images this camera can produce and believe it to be a great camera.  However, when you end up with pictures which are out of focus and when everyone in them has red-eye, you won't be thinking of the great picture the camera produced yesterday."
208,"You get what you pay for.  I bought this for my daughter to use in Media at school and she hated it.  It didn't cost much, and because of this, it's not even worth the expense to return.  Next..."
209,"I went ahead and spent the extra $500 bucks based on the Nikon reputation for a reliable quality product which could be used in the field for years to come.  After a little over 6 months of pampered use, the autofocus on this lens just stopped working altogether for no apparent reason.  Being the first Nikon product I have owned, I was not impressed.  The image quality however was quite nice and very wide at 12mm.  I never experienced any vignetting, but lots of flare when pointed anywhere near the sun.  I got the auto focus fixed under warranty and ended up trading it in for a little over $500 dollars considered in EX+ condition.  So I'm learning.  I'm done wasting my money on overpriced equipment.  Unless you are independently wealthy or get free gear from Nikon I would get a Tokina or Sigma instead.  If anything good comes out of this, it is that I used this lens in trade toward a Mamiya RB67 body and back, which looks like is going to be a lot of fun :) enjoy."
210,"Just letting folks know - I downloaded about 420MB of songs very easily - software worked pretty good with XP.  There was several times that it would just &quot;freeze&quot; but I just unplugged the USB cabled and &quot;restarted&quot; the FY200, and all seemed ok UNTIL...  IT IS NOW COMPLETELY DEAD.  All I did was simply hit the delete key to delete a 14MB song that took the total flash memory used to around 420MB and the thing is now completely useless.  I tried rebooting my computer and completely restarting FY200 to no avail.  Somehow all those 420 songs are still in the flash memory, but completely UNACCESSIBILE on the device itself.  No clue.  My dear hubby got this for my birthday 2 weeks ago - we have the Best Buy receipt and I'm taking it back today and keeping the cash or maybe will try an IPOD or minidisc.  The directions in the manual are completely a JOKE, and from what I've read the customer service will be equally laughable.  This is a defective product -do not buy."
211,"Best headphones I have ever had. These are also the most expensive headphones I ever purchased. So, I can't really compare them to more expensive brands.I find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones I have owned.The only problem I had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about 1/2hr to and hour.- To fix this I just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headband.It looks ridiculous but works great."
212,I've been using the Terk with a couple of Sangean and one Grundig radio.  Sometimes it helps reception and sometimes it seems to make no difference.
213,"What a piece of junk this receiver is!  The picture quality on non-HD programming is mediocre at best although the HD picture is amazing.  The problem is that only a handful of shows are in HD on DirecTV.  The first problem I had was when the analog receiver went out so I could no longer watch cable or traditional over the air broadcasts.  The receiver soon began to shut itself off for no reason.  After it would shut itself off, it would need to be fully reprogrammed. Now it has frozen on and you cannot shut it off, change channels or work the receiver with the remote or directly on the box.  The manufacturer told me to unplug it and plug it back in after 15 minutes.  Still frozen.  If I had not had it for 5 months already, I would have tried to return it and get a Sony."
214,"Despite the description stating that this remote is used for Nikon DSLR cameras, this remote does NOT work with the Nikon D3100 camera model."
215,"Does not charge my Ipad Mini 2 or any tablets I have with any of the ports, including the 2 supposed higher output ports."
216,"This is a great product.  I was able to purchase it from Amazon for only $25.00, and definitely got my money's worth.  I like this model because it has volume controls for both your voice output, and your hearing input.  I use it as a headset, and the only complaint I have is that the speaker has a lot of bass.  There are not any highs in the voice you hear, so your friend's voice always sounds emotionless and flat.  I guess it is this way to protect your hearing.  The sound is quite clear, just a limited frequency response."
217,"Fit perfectly on my head - I'm 5'1&#34;, so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too big.Great noise cancelation without giving me a headache.Great clear sound"
218,"I have always had a pair of headphones, usually purchased at Best Buy or something similar. I used to think price= quality. Turns out in the audio universe, that just isn't true. These headphones are really great for the price, and even for a $150 pair of headphones.Look, bottom line is: these are marvelous headphones. But connected to your laptop or other digital source, you will be missing out on SO MUCH audio quality. Everything either needs to be analog, or you need a semi high-quality USB DAC. Do some research, because given the proper signals, these headphones will really blow your mind. And take all these reviews with a grain of salt. One reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an iPod and another might be reviewing on a $10k audiophile setup."
219,These Koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for MP3 quality recordings. Not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of use.
220,"Koss is still making great products.  I have been buying Koss for over 30 years, and I have no complaints.  Got these for my college son.  He says they work great. They go on top of the ear, which my son likes that better than the ear inserts.  They fold up into a neat little case."
221,"I bought the Sony MDR-J10 after reading many glowing reviews. My experience with them leads me to wonder if I received a defective product.I own many Sony headphones and have had none of them disappoint me as much as these.  I bought these headphones to wear when exercising in the gym.  If the sound had been as good as expected they would have been a perfect choice.ProsOver ear fit: I agree they are comfortable around the ear and don't slip.  The cord is nothing different than cords I'm used to and performs well regarding tangle, length, and the headphones look like they'll hold up.Price: $8.12 is seriously good.ConsInside ear fit: Others reviewed the product as fitting so well in the ear that they had a hard time hearing outside sounds.  This wasn't the case for me.  I like this design over the plug style which gets too sweaty in the gym to be comfortable.  I was hoping these would be a good alternative, however I have small ears for an adult woman and found the bud part fit in the ear but not into the canal sufficiently to block outside sounds.  I could hear people talking and the overhead music in the gym.Sound: The biggest con for me was the sound.  I like Sony brand headphone sound and own several.  I've never had one sound this bad.  The sound is light and for the lack of better terminology - empty.  No ""delivery of deep bass"" as advertised and they lacked the fuller sound I am used to.  I compared them to my oldest set of Sony headphonesSony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphoneswhich I use to listen to movies on my tablet and laptop.  I found the MDR-J10Hs paled in comparison.For now, I have to keep looking for a gym headphone set."
222,"If your needs are for quick, web-based pictures. This camera will do the trick. It's handy to use and will give you decent shots for use on the web. Keep in mind a few things though... It needs plenty of light to give a good image. It eats batteries (I got about seven shots before having to replace the first one). The fact that it supplies both USB and Serial cables for connectivity is nice (something that many high-end cameras don't do).Overall, this is a high-end toy - or - a low-end digital camera. Don't expect too much from it. I moved up to the HP PhotoSmart C315 almost immediately after purchase. But this is a decent camera for the price, and one of the few at this price range which has support for Macintosh.Comes in a blue finished body as well."
223,I have one of these sitting in a closet somewhere or did my wife throw it out. This thing stopped working after light use in about 6 months. Velodyne is a respected name in the subwoofer industry but this thing does not cut it . Good velodyne subs cost a grand and then some. Quality control is sacrificed on the cheaper models. Also the power rating is misleading. Your sub has to be able to handle more than 100 watts especially when paired with a good quality amp. Don't buy it because of the name. If you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category. Velodyne won't get another dime of mine.
224,"The remote (overall seems to work). It was difficult to find codes to work my amplifier, however, the amp is 20 years old (backup amp for whole house system). One for All did respond rapidly, happily and succinctly to my problem. After code uploads (via phone and computer - very easy) were executed the 12th code did operate my system (in the majority). But ... I specifically wanted the remote for the RF capability. I could only get the RF remote to work well at 15 feet and intermittently at 20 feet. I really needed at least 50 feet (I used new batteries and changed the position of the receiver). It is possible my home has too much interference and it does have metal studs in the walls. So the upshot is I returned the remote."
225,"Some anti-snooping screens also prevent glare, but not this one. In fact, it has a high-glare surface that makes it almost useless in many indoor environments where you can't adjust the lighting. The privacy feature works well, but the glare makes the screen unusable in many environments."
226,"I ordered two Lens Pens to keep in the different bags, and I avoided buying the generic ones for the quality of the Nikon brand.. The disappointment was the black residue the cleaning tip left on my hand (picture added), which lead me to avoid using it on my lenses."
227,"Is it just me or is this one of the most cheaply produced units on the market?  The slide out cd tray is so flimsy that I fear putting any pressure on it for fear it will break in  half.  The unit is loud when the dvd is spinning, but otherwise the picture quality is good.  I had to relocate the unit on top of the tv instead of the tv stand for fear my son might accidently bump it the wrong way and break it."
228,"Put me down as another consumer that has had to send back his N75/F75.  I received this camera new the other day.  But, right out of the box it was broken.  Seems on many of these models, when you try to load the film, it just backs it right in to the canister.  The 75 is supposed to unwind the film to the end of the roll and then as you shoot, it winds it back up to the canister so that when you are done, the roll is completely in the canister.  But, on mine, and many others, there must be a firmware bug.  I'm waiting on a replacement now."
229,"We live in town and still had breaks in the signal. Just needed a portable radio for yard work, walking; but this didn't work well. Return procedure was a 5 star."
230,"This isn't rocket science. Both ends work as advertised without loosening with use, as is often the case. I recommend it for non-critical applications."
231,"I got these over a year ago at Walmart for $20 after my earbuds kept having their cord snapped and I figured they could cover my ears on those cold winter days while commuting. Long story short: they are and sound like $20 Walmart headphones. If you like higher quality sound, no need to read any further.Construction:Initially they were pretty tight around the head and really pressed on my ears, borderline discomfort after awhile. But after a month or so, they stretched out and now they fit alright. The frame and joints are all plastic and very noisy when you touch your headphones or try to adjust on your head, there is a noisy creaking and squealing of plastic rubbing on plastic. WD40 helped it a tad. The cord is definitely not sound isolating, as you can hear every time it touches or rubs against your clothes. These were clearly not made for portable devices because you could wrap the cord around your foot and still keep the iPod in your breast pocket while listening - the cord is really that long!Noise:These are not closed back design, so you get a hefty dose of outside noise. Listening to these while walking in noisy downtown is not a joy, they almost seem to amplify specific sounds while muffling other frequencies. There is minimal sound leakage, though, from the headphones outwardSound:Everyone has different taste and expectations. With these cans, you get what you pay for. I usually listen to Sennheiser HD570 or AKG Q460. The Sennheisers are in particular known for their almost overpowering treble, so listening to the Sony cans, I feel like they are missing something:Bass is there, but not really tight or thumpy. Quite muddy. Mids are very prominent. Treble is somewhat weak at the lower end and the high trebles are nearly non existent.Sound stage is not particularly wide nor forthcoming. There is not too much color to these cans, but what they really lack is detail and clarity. Instruments in complex records tend to just blend together (especially, if you like classical music, you will feel it). A good amp makes some difference, but not by much. They sound much worse when hooked up to an iPod directly.Impression:If you are used to iPod's bundled ear buds, you will find these OKIf you are used to something like Koss Porta Pro's (which are awful looking awesome sounding cans), you will find these Sony's weakIf you are used to circumaural AKG, Beyerdynamic or Grado's, you will find these atrocious.I use these Sony's mainly for listening to audiobooks.Suggestion:If you don't want to spend more than $20 and sound is not an issue to you, go for these, they will serve you well and last at least a year.If you could spare $50 or more, forget about these and look into Grado SR80 (on sale) or AudioTechnica's M50's or M35'sI'm growing more and more fond of AKG's Q460 Quincy Jones which are in the same ballpark as the Grado's. Not strong in treble, but pleasantly colored sound with good tight bass and wonderful clarity and detail, even straight from iPod, without amping them up. Very comfortable, very good noise isolation on these supra aural cans."
232,"I bought these partly to inspire myself to vacuum more often, thinking I could listen to podcasts while cancelling out the vacuum cleaner whine. Unfortunately, these headphones don't quite get there. The noise-cancelling works well for low-to-medium volume electric motor noises (computer, refrigerator), but not for a high-decibel machine like a vacuum cleaner. So I guess I live with the dust bunnies. :)"
233,"I write A LOT and was hoping to use this pen to free up paperwork. The moment i received it, it failed to work and I notified the vendor ASAP! The vendor was sorry for the inconvenience and promptly provided a refund and told me to discard the unit. I appreciated his prompt, courteous service but would not recommend this pen to anyone unless it came with the supporting software and special notebook needed."
234,"For the money, these are the best headphones you can get. They have strong bass, are loud, and the sound quality is great. They are pretty sturdy, I have owned 3 pairs, and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time. The only thing I suggest is buying some extra pads, they tend to get sweaty and I like to change them out so they can dry properly. I have ripped one, but replacements are cheap. Don't waste money on more expensive headphones, buy these and enjoy them for years to come."
235,"We received this item around Nov. 2003. The initial setup was problematic, and afterwords it worked some of the time, but mostly it would lock up the laptop. After several calls and emails to tech support, they finally acknowledged that the problem might be with the card and not with the laptop. They sent us a replacement card, and issued an RMA for the original card, which we had to pay to ship to them. The replacement card that they sent works fine, no crashes at all in the last two weeks. Very disappointed with their tech support."
236,"My main speakers go down to honest 30hz (NHT classic four).  So I thought I'd give my frequency response a bump in the 20-35hz region.  This sub can't play a frequency it's asked to play, and it's the slowest sub I've ever heard (it takes a second for it to ""warm up"" to a frequency, and another second for the sub to stop resonating - I'm exaggerating, but NOT REALLY).  For most people with a crossover of 80hz-120hz, this sub will basically ruin fast jazzy contrabass lines, it won't even sound like a double bass.  I was ok with this, music below 30hz, rarely demands speed (and my mains were taking care of the speed, and most bass anyway), I just want the rumble.  But, to top it off, it plays 2nd harmonic LOUDER than the base frequency below 30hz (that's one octave up). There are some Bjork pieces in which bass (just about pure sine) goes well into 20hz region, and this guy just plays one octave up.  It sounds alright musically, but I don't need my subwoofer to make musical decisions for me and transpose my music to whatever octave it decides to play :)  I prefer my subs to just give up and roll off gently if they can't do it; but this is UNACCEPTABLE.  I had to get my signal generator to confirm this and do a 20hz-200hz sweep, because I couldn't figure out why everything sounded ""off"".  I've had other subs in the exact same room and location, and none of them did this.  I had a special case where I crossed it very low, so my set up brought up the worst in this sub, it'll sound ok with a usual xo of 60-120hz.If you need something for explosions, it's alright; it sure produces the volume that my main speakers can't.  If you just want ""bump"" in your music, it's ok.  If you want this sub to actually play your music - LOOK ELSEWHERE.This sub can only be described as sloppy, you'll never hear a tight bass-drum coming out of this, just the sloppy rumble with boomy thump with an audible attack delay; even if you cross it at 150hz.  You'll get 300W-RMS of ""this"" though :), I don't know how polk decided to put its name on this monstrosity, and I'm totally not surprised about ridiculously low prices that these go for these days, and the only reason they fetch even that much is because of the polk name.  This sub sounds like a DYI project that doesn't sound quite right and needs more tuning.  And I had to get a signal generator and an oscilloscope to find out what it was doing.  Simple answer - just forget it.  I haven't tried other subs in 200 dollar range.  I've had ""legacy audio"", ""m&k;"" and ""velodyne"" subs before, so perhaps I've been spoiled."
237,This polarizer is useful to reduce excessive glare on my outdoor shots. The polarizer can be rotated to control the amount of polarizing effect that your camera gets.Overall this is a good buy for almost any kind of DSLR camera to enhance outdoor photos and giving that deeper blue sky and more vivid tone of outdoor shots.
238,I bought this mouse since I started getting some pain in my write from extended mouse use. I wanted to buy something ergonomic. This mouse itself is ergonomic. The palm and wrist positioning is good. However the bad part was having to move the mouse just like a regular one. It is uncomfortable and clumsy. I found positioning the cursor accurately quite difficult. The mouse would also fall off often from my tilted tray.I returned this and bought a Logitech Trackman. I find the trackman much easier and comfortable.
239,"I find myself in agreement with almost everyone else. I lay no claim to having an educated ear, but I have anyone's subjective ability to distinguish better sound quality from not so good sound quality. These headphones are definitely in the ""better"" category.I bought these 'phones to wear during keyboard practice so I wouldn't annoy others in the room. I quickly found they were so good that I started plugging them into the laptop when I wanted to watch a flick or listen to something on line. I imagine they will replace every other pair or headphones or earbuds in the house.I don't have comfort issues with them, but am sometimes annoyed at their tendency to fold up when I take them off for a moment. I'd rather fold my own headphones, thank you, not have a spring system do it for me.Old guy alert: I'm closer to 70 than 60, and I have the usual age-related high-end hearing deficiency. In the real world I can barely hear the top two or three notes on a piano. Through these headphones the tones are still faint, but clearer. I take that to mean that the over-ear pads are screening out some of the aural clutter that will bury all but the loudest high tones for me.All in all, very satisfied."
240,I was not impressed with this item. The ear cups were too small and felt to tight on my ears. It seems to have a less than quality look about it. I would not buy a similar item from Sony.
241,"For the money, these are excellent. I'm not very discriminating so can't comment on fidelity; I use these for my electric piano. They cover my ears well, provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended (one hour or so) wear. Also they're cool looking...."
242,"A must for sunny days and good value for the price, you could pay a lot more and that's ok if you camera is earning you cash. Budding photographers shouldn't be without at least this filter in their arsenal of photography gadgets and gismos."
243,"This has a bad connection, so I have to wiggle then try to tape it in a position that works. Will replace. My actual unit was a waste of time/money"
244,"I got this remote and was able to get all my devices to work but factory remotes have buttons with different funcctions and while you can learn a few keys lack of namming on an lcd really limits useability.  To contrast I eventualy got a urc rfs200URC RFS200 PowerPak Bundle w/ MasterControl RF20 and PowerBlasterfor about double the price and have about 15 or more LCD named programmed functions for every device.  the first 5 I programmed and nammed on each device are to turn its necessary companion devices on and to right setting such as on dvd I have tvpwr(tv power),hdmi2(tv to hdmi2),stpwr(Stereo power),stimp(stereo imput to dvd). the next set of screens have those wierd functions programmed in that only original remotes usually have.  Macros usually end up off so I prefer a simple layout like this just click them 123 in order.  Once you have a better remote like the urc rfs200 you really know what your missing and even though urc9910  gets the job done no namming and less programability makes it hard to use and less classy."
245,"I purchased two, didn't work for either one - in box to be shipped back to Amazon for a refund. Too bad, I wanted it to work, look like ok quality.Was for my new MB with one combo PS/2 port. One of the ports on the splitter works with either mouse or keyboard but not the other - couldn't get both keyboard and mouse working at the same time. Had different keyboards and mice around my office but no combinations had worked including reversing the ports, purple to green and green to purple. Also, few combinations locked my Windows 8 computer - soft or a hard reset didn't work and couldn't get the computer running, needed to unplug the power cord. Back to USB for the mouse and PS/2 for the keyboard."
246,"I loved this radio at first.  It has a lot of bells and whistles and appears to be a quality radio.  The earlier model lasted 20 years so when it finally gave out I purchased this model with the expectation that it would have a fair lifespan.  It was treated with kid gloves sitting on my bedside stand in an airconditioned house and used for about one hour a day.  After two years (one year after the warranty ran out) I tried to turn it on and found that keys were locked and 00:00 was flashing.  I did everything the manual advised and then tried the Sony online chat.  I was advised that it needed to be sent in for service.  Then I tried email.  They came to the same conclusion and added the link for service.  No repair was available but they offered an exchange for a reconditioned radio at the cost of $120 plus tax and shipping.  That is nearly the cost of a new radio!  I will never buy another SONY product.If you want an expensive disposable radio with neat features, this is the one for you."
247,"Will not work at all with any keyboard I have... Never tried the mouse, since I don't own a PS2 Mouse.The drive installed, but will not work.It also shows it in retail packing but just comes as a loose cable in a envelope."
248,"Have you been considering good headphones? Have you searched the net and Head-Fi looking for advice? Look no further. If you want open headphones, choose the Sennheiser PX100 or Grado SR60 or SR80. IF you want closed, there is no better choice under $150 than the MDR-V6. Beware the other Sony models - they have a few good ones, but most are not so good, even a few that are pricier than this one. This is the same headphone (except for cosmetics) as the MDR-7506-great sound-easy to drive with or without an amp-durable-comfortableDo not hesitate - you won't regret these!Update 6/2010:These are still great, but Shure has since introduced two models (the SRH-440 and 840) that are very nice and worth a listen, some will certainly prefer them to the Sony. The 440 is very close in price as well. Also worth considering is the Denon AH-D1000 and D-1001, which when on sale are around $100. The Denons have great sound, perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the Sony, but the Denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under $500. The Sony wins on ruggedness and value, though, and the sound isn't worlds apart..."
249,"I used to have these along time ago.  When I first got them, they were better than my other headphones I used to own.  These headphones have some serious bass and treble, and DJ's still use these headphones.  They are great for part 15 broadcasting, and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song.  They are good for remixing, shuffling music, and running a small FM or AM station.  Also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator.  They are the best!  I hope I can get another pair soon."
250,"While an attractive package with built in wireless (Blue Tooth, 802.11B), fingerprint recognition (for enhanced security and easy login), HP has in fact delivered a mess.The saga thus far:  Upon delivery the unit was delivered with a stack of supplement manuals and addendums describing the add-on features, however there was no manual for the Pocket PC 2003 operating system.  The manual is 160+ pages, and hidden on the CD as a PDF file (although my first round with tech support couldn't find it on the CD, and pointed me to the web site - where he couldn't find it either!)  It was explained to me that the O/S is provided by a third party vendor (Microsoft), and therefore HP isn't responsible for it!  Right...  (Never mind that it is essential to the unit, and is useless without it!)  Further, attempts to move the PDF to the iPAQ so it can be read with Adobe Acrobat Reader for the Pocket PC when needed proved useless.  I personally think this is inexcusable - I shouldn't have to download the file to a PC, keep the PC with me at all times, so I can have access to it when I have a problem with the Pocket PC - or print out a 160 page book on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper and figure out how to carry it with me.  (Kind of defeats the purpose of having a pocket PC!)  The unit needs to be delivered with this basic tool.Next: The unit filed after 2 hours of use.  It turned itself on while in my briefcase, got extremely hot, and completely locked up.  The 5450 would not reset.  Turns out that HP will not send a replacement (unless you want to pay for an additional warranty), so it disappeared for a week and a half (vice the 3 days that were promised when I called technical support).  When it was returned, I was informed that they couldn't duplicate the error, so they did nothing.  I have since determined that the optional leather executive case sold by HP was designed so that it can readily touch the overly sensitive power switch - turning the unit on so it will overheat and run the battery dead.  If I don't use the ... leather case (sold by HP for the 5450, it is much less prone to turning itself on and overheating!The handwriting recognition is poor and difficult to tailor.  As often as not, the unit will not exit the keyboard mode without a system reset.  (BTW, I find I do 7-8 resets a day at this point between this problem, memory card problems, and wireless problems.)As for the wireless - I have gottent it to work exactly once.  After numerous calls to technical support, I have managed to get it to work with one of four wireless networks.  According to tech support, the unit will not tolerate 802.11G in the area.  They consider it a problem with the 802.11G standards, never mind that my other 802.11B devices are working with no difficulty!  It gets worse! The configuration for each network involves multiple control panels that are scattered throughout the O/S, counter-intuitive and poorly documented.  You won't gett any help from the FAQ's or technical support web site either.  For instance, if you should manage to get the wireless to recognize a network, you then need to go through the network settings control panel, and indicate in three different drop-down boxes that you are connecting at ""work"" (rather than the ""internet"" or ""home"").  Use of any other setting will effectively prevent the device from using the wireless, and requires you to configure a modem (never mind that the whole point of wireless is to avoid using a modem, or you may need different wireless configuration settings at different locations)!  (Why work=wireless has yet to be explained to me by technical support.)  Clear yet?  I thought not...The latest saga has to do with the SD memory card.  It cannot be written to or have the existing files deleted.  Suspecting a corrupt file, I tried to find information on formatting the card (or any other information on the memory cards) on the HP web site.  There was none.  When I called technical support, they informed me that every SD card needed to be formatted before it was used.  (Again, nothing in the user guide or the web site).  Further, there was no utility provided by HP to do this!  I needed to go to a another vendor's web site, and BUY this utility separately (even though it was REQUIRED before I could use the card - even the one HP sold me with the 5450!.  Despite my better judgment, I bought the utility - and low and behold - it doesn't work either.  Again, how HP can justify not including a basic utility that is required to use the device eludes me.Finally, this was one of two units I bought for evaluation in my laboratory.  The other I gave to my network systems engineer.  His story isn't any happier. In addition to the issues I have encountered, his problems have centered around that expansion pack, and the fact that they are such a poor fit, that the unit constantly sees the battery in the expansion pack as going dead (because it fits so poorly) that the unit keeps shutting down.  Any devices plugged into the expansion pack are constantly seen as being removed and installed - requiring numerous resets as things try to reload.We have also bought the new Viewsonic pocket PCs and Casios for evaluation.  They have been an order of magnitude more reliable that the HP iPAQ 5450, despite (because) fewer features, and further came with complete documentation.  None of these have failed to date, nor have we had an issue requiring our contacting technical support.Our conclusion: the HP iPAQ 5450 is a poorly executed design, lacking basic documentation, with poor support, and should therefore be avoided at all costs."
251,"First off, I'd like to advise not to throw the box away before registering this product.  The serial number is on the back of the package and you need it to claim the 2 year warranty registration.I bought this for the TI-Graph Link (Black) for my TI-86.  It's an old serial link, which used to work on a Windows XP computer I used to have WITH a working serial port.Now most computers don't have serial ports, so I will have to buy the TI-Graph Link (Silver)Texas Instruments 94327 Ti Graphlink USBa 20+ USD value.Aside from this I don't know what else I can use this devise for.  I tried saving the graph link with no success at all.I write this so you don't go making the same mistake.  I can't rate the product higher, as my experience was disappointing."
252,"Like clockwork, I experienced the dreaded memory card error after 18 mo (just out of warranty). I recently bought a new battery because the generics had such short lives and were a source of frustration for me. However, even with 2 canon batteries I only seem to avoid the memory card error temporarily. I'm hesitant to buy another Canon camera based on the reports about the 1) Memory Card Error, 2) E18 Lens error, and 3) fragile LCDs on the new SDxxx series that I hear about. Here are some tips for those of you dealing with the experience:1) I used photorescue to recover some of my pictures from my CF ( [...] ).2) At some point you may find it necessary to truly WIPEOUT your card if you are not able to reformat it properly ( [...] )3) Always keep your batteries fully charged, a low battery will increase the chances of the dreaded memory card error and render it useless until you remedy the memory card error (see Tips #1 & #2).I really loved everything about this camera, the 3min movie clips, crystal clear LCD, good quality photos (although I gave to edit the images to remove the extreme red hue in some of my indoor images), and compact size/weight. However, the rampant memory card error is inexcusable, warranting only a 1 or 2 stars. If you haven't or don't experience these problems, consider yourself lucky. ;)Note: I never experienced any of these problems with the s330 model. I had the s330 previously, which I gave to my sister. I'm sad to see that the new Canon models are having a lot of problems."
253,"I had this head phone for 12 YEARS now i bought in 2000 when i was single and had cash and was looking for best head phone i could buy. i got in 2000 for $100 bucks thought was alot but has last for 12 years now and still sound as good as any head phone i have had.  my kids have used them too now days, i see these dre beat and other head phones and see people go through them head phone and wonder what they do to them, you pay for head phone that cost that much you would expect them to last! I went through whole decade with these, i saw headphone get smaller and smaller, now getting bigger and bigger. which is funny but i have had this pair and nothing go wrong with them,  can wear all day without problem.  i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding head phones that will last.  i see the price has double since i bought them last, but will being another pair whenever these go out if they ever do!!!"
254,"I got my item within a week even though it is mentioned it will take a while to deliver. Item condition is also good, but It is not 3M original product. It is not perfectly fit to my office laptop Levevo T420. I knew earlier but price was so cheap compare to all others. I bought it, main duty of privacy filter is to hide screen from others who seats near to you, that is working perfectly. My near mate always thinks what I am doing in my laptop, because he can't see anything from that direction. I liked this item not loved it, because original 3M privacy filter I saw it, it is very cool and awesome compare to what this item is. anyways it worked for me, I am now happily working in office without worry what others can see in my laptop screen, lol. I enjoy it."
255,"-Lightwieght-Durable...so far-Excellent Bass-Good Treble-Very Crisp Sounds-Affordable-Cool Design-Fairly comfortable (I don't find it too hard on my ears even after 5+ hours of wearing them, but I have small ears)."
256,"This is a plug adapter only, not a voltage converter. This was not clear in the advertising. My only clue was the sticker across the  plug holes that said, YOU NEED A CONVERTER to use this!  GEEZ.  Keep shopping. Find a converter/plug adapter kit instead."
257,"Sound quality is ok at low volumes but speakers ""rattle"" as you turn up the volume.  Bought them for both my notebook computer and cd player.  Batteries go dead really fast when turned off.  Very short speaker cable (3 ft).  Not worth the price!"
258,"This is a nice combination of VCR and DVD and a great space saver.  Unfortunately, 7 months after purchase, the DVD stopped opening and closing.  Philips has a 91-day to 1-year warranty and will prorate the product for replacement.  You send them the machine and a check and they send you a new one.  Not good pricing on exchange, either."
259,"I ordered the ""refurbished"" version from ""Happyezdeals"" for my son in Oregon.  I expected him to have lots of pictures for me already, but then I just got an e-mail that they had ""just"" sent it.  So I am not a happy camper! Not only that, but the vendor writes: ""I took a great care to give you the best service possible. And I hope that you will evaluate this transaction positively.""  Yeah.  The price seems very good, and I hope that the card has arrived and works for my son.  I'll let you know.  In the mean time, I'd advise that you avoid this vendor if you are in a hurry."
260,Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.
261,"As a previous reviewer wrote, incompatible with Sounblaster Live cards due to a conflict with the Memory IO C000-C01F being used used by both cards.  Disable one or the other and your fine, both will cause a BSOD(Blue Screen of Death)."
262,"As my other reviews show, I'm easy enough to get along with and don't expect the world from cameras, radios, etc.  But I do expect them to do something for the price, and this didn't.  I bought one from C Crane five or six years ago and had the typical complaints that have been voiced here:  Poor AM performance when GREAT was advertised, and the mysterious LCD fade out.We're talking metro NY here, it could only sporadically pick up WCBS in Parsippany! (That sounds like a Seinfeld line, but it's true)My $5 garage salew bought Thompson (GE) did better in Bergen County)Now, since you're reading the reviews (which by the way, I've never seen so many 1, 2, 3 star reviews for ANY product on Amazon)I will make a recommendation: the Etone E10, which is what this was supposed to work like and didn't. And save $60, or save $90 and get an FR400, or get that in camaflouge and save $120.BUT GET SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS!!!!Luckily I lost mine a couple of years ago so it's not around to annoy me."
263,"I bought these based on good reviews like above. The treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm. Not tight and detailed based like from my Sennheiser 580's but those cans cost ~$200. Only issue I have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time. Eventually, they start falling out a lot. Nice sounding phones but won't take huge amounts of abuse."
264,"After minimal use over the course of 2 months, the cable produced a short near the plug. The springy metal next to the plug gave me the impression that would never even be an issue. Apparently the purpose of the springy metal is for something else, not to prevent a short.These headphones are rated very well on Amazon, maybe I got a dud."
265,"This is my experience: I was making a few CDs and noticing that many of the songs I recorded on them, particularly those at the end of the disc, skipped and popped a lot, basically rendering the whole CD worthless.  After spending several hours rebooting my machine and checking all of the hardware to see what the problem was, I figured I'd try another brand of CD-Rs and eureka! I was able to churn out a bunch of CDs with no problems whatsoever.It's a bit surprising that a brand name like this puts out such low-quality CD-Rs.  I ended up throwing away at least half of these CD-Rs I tried to record before just pitching the entire spindle after I got this other brand.So if you're having trouble burning CDs, check what kind of disc you are using first before wasting time checking to make sure your computer equipment is okay."
266,"This monitor was a real deal, considering a lot of other monitors that have the same tube technology and technical ratings (or less) cost a whole lot more!  (See LG Electronics)I just bought this monitor, and find that it was more than I was looking for.  19&quot; is a real increase in screen space for me, but too often I find that this does not mean high quality.This Samsung 955DF monitor is worth every penny.  I just hope they do not get smart and lift the price.I need to save money, and I am glad that I choose this."
267,"The Linksys USB hub has worked without incident with several devices attatched.  It is small enough to even pack in my briefcase if needed, nice rubber feet on the bottom to ensure it stays where you want it, even with a little pull.As another user commented, the LEDs are a bit confusing, I don't really pay attention to them, but nonetheless, confusing.  Other than this, I found no annoying issues with the product.Installation was a breeze, as with most USB devices, no extra software needed, and the user's guide was very straightforward.Overall, I rate the Linksys USB hub 4 stars, because of it's simplicity and excellent performance, along with it's confusing LEDs."
268,"This was one of the worst switches that I have bought.  none of the software that came to manage it worked.  After many attemps to resolve with netgear, I returned it with no hassles; thanks Amazon.  I ended up buying a 608 netgear which works flawlessly."
269,The Nano is much smaller than the iPod holder on the Belkin pack.  The suction cups still works but overall the design of this battery pack does not suit the Nano.  Afterall you paid so much price for the Nano for its cute thin design.  Carrying this battery pack with the Nano beats the very purpose for which you bought an expensive Nano.I am sure some other company will soon come up with a battery pack exclusively made for the Nano.  I will wait and buy that rather.  I returned this product within 2 days of buying it
270,"ok, so i got this lens because i wanted a compact wide angle lens that i could easily throw in my bag to cover events. however , i was greatly disappointed with the lens. it vignettes like there is no tomorrow, even using profile corrections on photoshop wont get rid of all the vignetting. PLUS this vignetting is not a pleasing vignette. its dark, ugly, and what it does is under expose images by more than a stop. another major issue is image quality. the image quality takes a beating with this lens. im assuming its because of poor optics. i own a couple of L lenses and the comparison is night and day when it comes to image quality. also im comparing it to my non L lenses like my 50mm 1.4 and my 85mm 1.8. pictures just look grainy with this lens and the color contrast is pretty bad too. I wouldn't recommend this lens to anybody really.Pros:-small- solid build- fast focusingCons:-massive vignetting-poor image quality-horrible lens flares- bad color contrast-poor optics- more cons than pros."
271,"These headphones are FANTASTIC.  Not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound, but they're also lightweight and extremely comfortable.  They fit firmly on your head, cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vice.My dad bought a pair of the Koss Pro4AA Titaniums and I have to say that this Sony pair blows those away. While the sound quality is similarly great, the Koss's are about 5X as heavy!  They really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour.  The Sony's are much more comfortable and MUCH more lightweight and portable.  I definetely recommend these.  You won't be disappointed."
272,"The product delivers the appropriate output from my hosting unit to my two separate speaker systems.  However, once the two output sources are both connected to this unit, a buzzing sound from both speaker sets occurs.  If just one of the speaker sets is attached to the splitter, the buzzing goes away.As an amateur, I cannot say whether this experience is to be expected from a splitter or not.  All that I can say is that I did not expect a side-effect of a splitter being that the two output sources would have a buzzing sound.  I assumed that the sound quality would still be preserved.  Will be trying a different splitter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIESU/) to see if that corrects the problem.And to be clear, the unit DOES NOT split my audio into a right/left like other commenter have suggested.  My only complaint is the buzzing noise!"
273,head pad part  can be folded easily and save lots of room.and it came with extra adapter for big hole. so my daughter can use it for her digital piano and listening music from regular MP3 player
274,"Great quality in sound and are quite durable. We use a pair at work to monitor Camera sound during interviews and it blocks exterior noise well without completely blocking off sound so you can still hear your fellow crew.Folds down to a manageable size, and comes with a cheapo leather pouch that does the job. For the $60 or so bucks I paid for it I really can't find anything wrong with it or any reason to go for a more expensive model.If you want Beats headphones, take the stickers off the side and use a white sharpie and write a B.Good set of features for the price for sure."
275,"I have used the MDR-V6 since 1990 when I was just a kid. I have loved using them everyday since the day I first heard a CD play on them. The sound is like liquid sxx in my ear canal. I seriously had to spend some quality time with the lights out and my CD player and these HPs. I still have my original HPs and they sound just like the virgin HPs I unwrapped the day I first heard digital music. I use the MDR7506 on my Digi 002 for Pro Tools sessions, but they sound exactly like these imo. I'm emotionally attached to these HPs though. The MDR7506 is what's in the studio for anyone. I keep these MDR-V6 for ME. I bought these in a special Gold Edition wrapped in red satin pillow with a special screw on 1/4"" adapter. I lost the adapter and the satin pillow hit the file 13. I bought another 1/4"" adapter from a local store for my midi keyboard. I like the ability for these HPs to be worn with one ear folded up so you can listen to yourself sing and listen to your audio at the same time.[...]+++EDIT DEC 2011 **********************************************************-Sony dot com is selling these today and they have better response than 7506 HP , its V6 5-30k and 7506 10-20k[...]-sweetwater dot com sells the beyerdynamic DT250 earpads that are better than the sony ones after a few years. The sony earpads will flake after a year or so. The beyer ones fit the sony v6 and 7506[...]"
276,"I read the reviews, not a bad product but my choices were1) Keep the 3 (2 feet at initial stress) foot Panasonic original cord2) 12 feet3) 25 FeetThis one starts to stress at 3.5 feet maybe and is pulling the phone around at 4 feet.I gave it 3 stars since it's probably my fault for not believing the reviews."
277,"I have owned a lot of headphones over the years, and I have never found any reasonably priced headphones that approach the sound quality that these have.  Yes, they aren't exactly stylish - the design dates from the 1980s and it shows.  But there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years.  You don't survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for it.They aren't perfect for all occasions - I wouldn't go running with them because the old-school foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty.  You could use them on a plane, but they don't have any sound-isolating/noise cancelling features and they don't isolate your ears.  But for like commuting on the subway, at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep, they are perfect.  Good base response, but nicely balanced throughout.  Crisp, not muddy at all.  They hold up well if you don't abuse them, I had a pair years ago and they lasted a long, long time."
278,"I've had this gadget for a while now.  It was well thought out and it works well.  I'm completely pleased.  I made my decision based on the comments by Amazon reviewers.  Thanks for the good advice, people!"
279,"I need several KVM switches of this general kind, but need to find out if this permits the use of a PS2 to USB adapter.Two hours on the phone with some folks in Bangalore (or thereabouts) has left me with more questions than answers.WHY would we buy a product from CISCO>/LINKSYS when their tech support people are so clueless?"
280,"At 1024 x 768 resolution, this memory card holds 200-390 images on my  Polaroid PDC-700 camera (that's like 8-16 rolls of film).  The price and  capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events.  **Go crazy**  and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eye!I  took 89 pictures in 5 hours at my company's &quot;Relay for Life&quot;  event on Friday, and really enjoyed not having to &quot;budget&quot; my  photos or worry about running out of film.  The image quality was  excellent, and downloading was quick &amp; easy with a digital film  reader.I'm planning a 2-week trip to Spain this fall, and am considering  an additional 32MB SanDisk memory card just in case I get **Too Crazy**.  Does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cards?"
281,"Was happy at first, the cables are a little weak and flimsy, after connected for a while, one speaker quit working.  The speaker works fine with Hosa Dual 1/4&#34; TS to 3.5 mm cord.  Will probably return this item.  Have always been happy with Hosa before."
282,"In my past I've specified many cabling jobs and researched all of the ingredients required for a good job.You can use the best cable, switches, etc. but if you have a crappy plug you have compromised the entire job. I've seen it and it makes no sense to skimp on any one part of a good cabling job.I always used AMP part number 5-554720-4It's for a solid (never use stranded copper) CAT5 and above cable and whether the job specified all 8 wires or not I always specified that all 8 wires be terminated (TS568B) because that's what the plug's crimp (strain relief) was designed for.Also, don't just pick up your crimper and assume it's OK. Test it. I've seen contractors use the same dye for years and the teeth wear down. They fail their cable test (with a definite pattern across all closets) and the last place they look is their crimp tools. Ethernet is somewhat forgiving but always go for the best you can get.Use a good crimp tool and dye designed for that crimp tool. I always specified AMP because I wanted to be consistent across the plug, crimp tool, and dye. Contractors used to crap their pants when they read in my RFPs that I was specifying the crimp tools, dyes, and plugs (and Cable Testing Tools) but you have to if you want the best consistent results.Whatever. Do your homework, find a good system, and move on to the next level of cabling."
283,The head will not lock sufficiently to keep the camera from flopping over even for a light weight compact camera. I returned it.
284,"This works well as a 7-port USB HUB (2 Powered Ports, and 5 Others, all USB 2.0)  however in my dell laptop it seems to make the Laptop crash at bootup to a blue screen everytime that it detects that this device is plugged in"
285,"I've bought two pairs of these now, only because one was a gift to my Dad.  They're the best sounding I've used for the budget (and budgets hundreds higher).  Just know the ear pad will start to fall apart after awhile, I think it was around two years for me."
286,"These are not top of the line nor are they junk, mid grade and do what they are supposed to"
287,"Being budget minded, I didn't want to spend $300+ for a CL polarizer since I'm not a high end user, but I didn't want to buy a $10 cheepo either. This seemed some where in the middle with good reviews.The Tiffen polarizer really brings out the definition in the clouds and removes glare on water or shiny surfaces just as it should. Super snug fit, smooth rotation, good photo results.Definitely get the plastic wrenches for removal though. Once it's on your lens, it's on. Tightening ring is so narrow, fingers just won't do.Overall though, very happy with this filter."
288,"After purchasing my first dslr (Canon Rebel XSI) I quickly discovered that the kit 18-55 just didn't have the range I needed.  I somehow landed a job doing freelance work for the local newspaper the same day I got my camera, so I needed something that would give me more versatility on a very limited budget.  After reading the reviews I ended up with this, and I've been pleased.Granted, this is not an ""L"" lens, but at this price I wouldn't expect that.  Also, if you have shaky hands or take a lot of photos in low light this may not be the right lens for you.  It might be worth looking into the 55-250 IS.  In decent light this lens takes beautiful photos, and I've had many successful results with it.  It is great outdoors (I recommend purchasing a lens hood).I recently purchased my first ""L"" lens--the 17-40mm, and while it's a great lens, the 28-105 still lives on my camera for its versatility.  And even though I'm now in the market for something with IS, faster, and with more range, I think I'll still be hanging on to this one for awhile.  If I wasn't serious about photography as a career and used this as just a hobby lens I would be thrilled.  If you want something affordable with decent quality, I highly recommend this."
289,"After used it a while, it starts losing left speaker sound and it diminished volume. Don't try to fix it by cutting this part and affix it to your old one, it doesn't work. Don't even buy Phillips or other adapter with 2 wires attached together if you're looking for quality sound and be able to talk on your phone while listening to your party on car speaker. One line is the only good product, like iMonster from Walmart..."
290,"Well, I was somewhat happy because it came well preserved no cracked jewels cases from other buyers. I was looking for clear all over and another brand but amazon did not have others instead this brand. I did see other sellers but I like to buy directly and sold by Amazon in case there's a problem.My reason not giving it a 5 star is as followed:I wanted cystal clear trays front and bottom.More importantly, these cases contain label warning saying contaims a chemical lead that can cause cancer according California state law. My concerns are due you wash your hands after handling the cases. If I was you, yes these avoids paranoia when trying to have contact with food. I know we don't live in a perfect world. Its impossible so I learn to live with it and get use to it. I suppose!"
291,"The item I received was ont exactly the one pictured.  Those received appear to be made of high quality materials with stout connectors.  Having a ""tight"" connection at the RCA jack is important but these are ridiculous.  It's nearly impossible to fully seat them, and when removed they pulled both of the rim pieces off my female RCA jacks on my NAD tuner.  These things are just WAY too tight to be of good use and might damage your equipment.  Some cables are designed to be loosened by twisting the end before inserting, but this does not appear to work for these cables.  Overall VERY disappointed in these things."
292,"This extension cord is a lifesaver.  I recently installed a very noisy air conditioner in my apartment and as a result I could not hear my TV without blasting the sound.  Not wanting to be ""that neighbor,"" I invested in this cord so I could watch TV with headphones.  I'll echo what others have said: the cord transmits sound very well even through my rinky little iPod headphones, though the coil is pretty tight and reaching to 20 feet is a stretch (pun slightly intended).  I'm fine with that because the jacks on the cord are very secure (no slipping) and I only need about 10 feet of extension, but if you're looking to use this for longer distances, then I'd suggest buying two cords.  Still, ten bucks is a good value for this handy little product."
293,I tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound. I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better. These are just right.
294,Even though it is advertised to work on a DSLR it will not fit the Canon lens. I called the Tamron tech support and they affirmed it will not work on digital cameras. It resides in the useless junk pile along with other stuff I bought on Amazon that did not perform. The resellers advertise stuff that does not fit the manufactures description. Too bad as the price is so low it does not warrant returns.
295,"I bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to. I listen primarily to classical music, but these are good for Rock and Pop as well. The bass is big, deep, and roomy.  Your amplifier doesn't need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion. Even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble.  The bass doesn't overpower the rest of the frequency range. Right now I am on the fence as which I would recommend: these Sony 700's or the Sony 7506's.  The 7506's just seem a tad more accurate.  If you are into Rock or Pop more and like beefier bass then I would opt for the 700's.  I have no long term use with either.  So I will defer to others as far as long term durability."
296,"Fairly comfortable for short term use, decent length on the springy cord. I don't know if it helped but I used it to build 2 PCs and they work great. Probably not a necessary buy but better safe than sorry when building $1,000+ computers. I read on Tom's that sometimes small, not-noticeable shocks can hurt performance without killing the component, so probably worth the investment."
297,I have these connected to Alesis M1 320 active monitors from my Mac Mini. I also own the same HOSA cables with the RCA jacks.I did the following test. I hooked each up and noted the volume levels. The RCA jacks won clearly - louder output at a lower volume level.At least with my speakers.
298,"I have looked at the others, even bought a different one when I mistakenly thought it wouldn't work on an xp machine.  I much prefer this style of keypad to the flat wafer looking ones on the market.  For anyone used to a regular adding machine style calculator layout, this is the best one I've seen.I think I have an older model but it looks exactly like this one.  It says its a KU-9880.Now, a usb hub would be a cool addition to it, but... I'll sacrifice it for the ergonomics."
299,"The Sony V900 Headphones have a printed frequency response of 5-80,000hz and I believe it.  They are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels.  They have great imaging.  The only thing that is wrong with them is that don't fit my head the way that they were designed and I have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear.  I can wear them hours on end.I listen to mostly classical music, but right now I have some Lords of Acid on which is dance/electronic.  The response is fairly flat, but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt!  My opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral.  Someone mentioned the Sony model 7506 which to me has a more forward mid-range.If you can't afford these headphones the Sony DJ MDR-700 seems to be just about the same, but a tad less comfortable.  It has about the same response and sensitivity.But I would recommend this model for long term use and happiness.  The only problem I have had is the ear-cups have worn out and that is because I am in Florida and sometime when coming in from the outside I have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of that."
300,"great in total, but very bad auto focus, as much as i spend my time to tell you abut how much  am disappointed about focusing in low light situation, keep searching  for the focus point till you turn it to manual and show it to her.....  ;0)but still great lens in that value of money( sharp, light like plastic toy, fast )"
301,"Extremely hapy with these. I was looking to replace the pricy Koss PortaPros, had tried the Koss KSC75 Portables but found them awkward and too fragile, as well as Koss&#8217;s &#8220;The Plug,&#8221; which yes&#8212;keep falling out of the ear. The SportPros are actually a mini-version PortaPros, same over-the head construction, fold-in ear pieces, leather case, and  plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound. Not to take anything away from the PortaPros, but  I can have two sets of these for the same price. They stay on your head, they stay on your ear, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the over-the-ear hooks of the  KSC75 Portables. Just an-all-around better headphone&#8212;nuf&#8217; said."
302,"I was only attracted to this lens pen because it's a Nikon product and it had a bunch of good reviews on it. However, when I received the item it was in a used condition (although I paid for a brand new one from ""Shopit"").Aside this, the brush works fine, I use it to clean dust particles off the camera and lens.The downside of it, is the tip brush usually aiming at cleaning finger prints and tough marks on your lens glass. When I first received the item I opened the cap where the tip is located. I applied it on my finger and I had a black ink-like circle on it. So I thought I might have a bad copy as it was used. Nonetheless, I checked other reviewers comments and it seems that everyone is facing the same issue. So I preferred not to use it on my lenses as it can damage the expensive glass.Better use a microfiber cloth along with a rocket blower to clean the lens."
303,"I won't say anything more than the positive reviews here. I have had a pair of PortaPros since 1998. I use them everyday to go to work on the trains. I literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use. The great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something, they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to Koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6. I have done this about 5 times in 9 years. Try that with Sennheiser!!"
304,"They are cheaply made & often break just using them in a normal manner; but what isn't these days..They hold the CD's & DVD's & I guess that's what counts in the end.I wish there was another manufacture making these, but there does not seem to be many.."
305,these headphones are ok.  slightly too tight (i do have a big head).  and the sound quality is average.  i do not reccomend them.
306,"Hooked this up to a Dell desktop and an IBM T43P via docking station. Mouse doesn't work with IBM laptop, even if laptop is rebooted. Checked the manual and it says if you have an IBM or Toshiba laptop, it won't support both mouse and keyboard so use the laptop's keyboard. Yeah right!I called customer service, which has no toll-free number, long wait time, and they eventually just said ""yep, doesn't support IBM"".Wish I had sorted the reviews by ""worst first"" before buying, rather than relying on the overall rating."
307,"faulty. focus ring stuck.  a lens should last years!! not months!! This is the second one that has failed, and I have only used it once. I would not recommend this lens, because it is apparently too fragile or has a manufacturer flaw."
308,"I wouldn't ever buy a Tivoli product just because of their bad customer service.No, I don't own this model I owned the Tivoli Pal but based on my experience I'm offering my advice to stay away from Tivoli.I registered my new Tivoli Pal and I had to install two new batteries at almost $24.00 each and then it died completely after only eight months.Tivoli customer service refused to honor my registration as proof of purchase, does anyone ever keep a receipt?They wanted to charge me another $50,00 to repair it."
309,"I have had 2 pairs of these and they are the best.  Awesome sound reproduction. Very ""true"" reproduction for those of us who scoff at the BASS BOOST buttons.  I used both primarily for live sound mixing. But after these it is hard to use anything else in you MP3 player.  The size adjustment keeps them comfortable. The flip earphone allows you to hold it up to your ear for a quick listen.The first pair was a travel pair and went on plane flights, car rides, remote shows. After excessive abuse, one of the ear phone joints broke.  I repaired it once and that lasted about 1 year.The second pair sits on the Board at our church.  They have been there for years. The ear phone foam is starting to flake off onto those of us with facial hair."
310,"I would classify this headphone extension as light duty.  The wire material is small diameter which is nice and the coil is likely to stretch a little faster than more heavy duty type.  This is to be expected on any coil type wire.  The connectors are your typical molded pieces.  I expect to have to replace them at some time in the future.  Again, not a fault, but a reality for any cable.  For the price, you can't beat these.  The adapters are very functional and handy to have in your kit."
311,"My experience with this router has been less than pleasing, to say the least.I used the router rather happily, without issues, for a few weeks. Then one day my internet connection went down, and when it came back up I couldn't get my computer to connect to the router. Even sitting litterly right next to the router, I would get an error message, stating ""There was an error attempting to connect to NETGEAR"". After hours of troubleshooting, I finally got it working again. But that success was short lived. Now it seems like just about every day, I inexplicably lose connection to the router, despite being only about ten feet away from it. Then, half the time when I try to reconnect, I get an error message. What's more, there are times where I supposedly AM connected to the router, but the Internet doesn't work, despite my connection being intact. Then I have to play around with disconnecting from the router and then trying to connect again, often without success, and to the point of driving me insane.To be fair, the router does have its strong points. The password protection is definately a plus. I'm glad not to have to worry about other people using the connection. Still, I don't think that this router is worth the trouble you have to go through just to get it to do what it's supposed to do. I'm sure that there are plenty of better password protected routers out there. Get one of those."
312,"Looking for headphones to go with my iPod, since the earbuds that came with it hurt if I wear them for long periods of time...Not impressed with these headphones.  ""Rich bass"" my ear -- the cheap headphones that came with my last portable cd player have better-sounding bass.  These Sony headphones are tinny sounding, and I need to crank the volume to hear anything through them (or press the 'phones to my ear -- the spring clip doesn't have enough tension to put them in that place for me).On the plus side, I suppose, they are comfortable to wear - I don't find that they ""deform"" my ear in any way, and they don't hurt.  They'll suffice for running, but I'll be sticking with the Apple earbuds for other uses (plane trips, at work, etc.)"
313,"keyboard works, however, mouse is not recognized.  I purchased 5 and all five of them have the same problem.  Software does recognize a usb compliance mouse device, however, mouse click/movement does not register at all.fake advertising about how it would work on kvm.  it does NOT.Got TRENDnet USB to PS/2 Converter TU-PS2 (White)  instead, works wonderfully."
314,"Reception seems adequate, but this is pretty cheaply made.  After less than a year, it was ready for the scrap heap.  Overpriced!"
315,radio has poor calibration of frequency poor sensitivity. company just pushes cause its modelled after the KLH table radio. Don't waste your money on this nice looking but very poor preforming cheap Chinese crud. I wont buy another. I would suggest sangean or Cambridge audio but not Tivoli.
316,"I know many on here love this trackball, so please don't flame me. I bought this today and set it up. I was shocked at the flimsy, cheapy feel of the scroll ring, and of the motion of the trackball itself. I was not at all impressed, for 100 bucks. I'm returning it."
317,"I have issues with the budget Tiffen UV-filter not being multi-coated due to the potential for flare.  While this is not multi-coated, you are less likely to experience flare due to the types of scenes that you typically shoot with polarizers (not into the sun).  It does do a decent job of polarizing and while I would prefer a multicoated one, they are significantly more expensive (unlike multicoated UV filters).  This does the job and I am able to manage the flare, so I'll stick with this until I can afford a better one."
318,"It seemed like the best deal out there.  16 Gig ports for a great price.  I own two of these, bought them together.  Wish I could send them back, and Netgear just won't have anything to do with them.  Within a couple months, they were locking up, dropping connections.  I personally think its because these are fanless, and seem to overheat very quickly. I am amazed that Netgear thinks that a switch should be unplugged when not in use... a network switch is always in use.As far as performance goes, these switches are unable to sustain anything over 200Mbps.  I am going back to linksys.  Was getting over 500mbps sustained and never a lock up with even the cheapest linksys switch."
319,"An excellent player overall. The quality is good, and the download time is really short. The software is very easy to use. The FM radio and voice recorder is a plus, however I don't find myself using the voice recorder much. There are some shortcomings however. The plastic on the docking station feels flimsy and cheap, I was expecting better quality, such as the Sony Clie. Also, all the buttons have the same shape, and it is hard to find the one you want in the dark. I think Creative could have preserved the style of the unit and still made the buttons different shapes. The headphones are cheap and uncomfortable, I reccoment a pair of Sony w.ear. And finally, to operate the unit, you have to take the player out of the &quot;leather&quot; case. They should have just made slots on the sides so you can access the buttons."
320,"This is a great adaptor, HOWEVER it is not in my opinion a complete adaptor. I purchased this thinking that I could use it with my Nikon DSLR camera, and realized after an hour of setting up my telescope and getting it zeroed in, this does NOT attach to the camera, and you need an ADDITIONAL adaptor that fits into this one for your camera ring. These are specific to your camera so I understand that you can't sell a ""universal"" kit, but it would have been nice to know that up front."
321,"54 year old audio engineer, video shooter/editor, former radio host. I used 7506s for my video shoots for many years. They are wonderful. These V6s are every bit as great. Light comfy, straight excellent sound. If you're gonna get a cramp because it doesnt have a red Pro sticker on the side, get 7506s. If you want equally great headphones at steal of a price buy the V6s here, you'll be very happy.Get these phones, and live happily ever after."
322,"Wonderful! The specs looked great. After receipt, I tried them out with my 5 Star iTunes playlist. I had been using Etymotics ear buds, but wanted a longer cord and an over the ear style. The Sony beat them hand downs. I had originally ordered a pair of Audio-Technica ($148.00). To me, the Audio-Technica muffled the bass sounds a bit and didn't give me the crisp highs that I had expected, or was used to. I returned those and ordered the Sony MDR-V6 (about $85), and couldn't be happier! Better than the Etymotic ear buds - solid bass - but not too much., and nice crisp highs. Also, they are a bit more comfortable than the Audio-Technica, and a lot less expensive! The Sony's are solid!"
323,Entry level product but very adequate for connecting printer to desktop computer. Good quality at a good price. Received well packed and sooner than expected.
324,"This device did not work  from the first day I tried to use it. Worse it damaged an irreplaceable tape. I would not recommend this. I was going to return to Amazon, but decided to throw it away instead. Please do not buy this product. It really does not work and it may damage your, currently, irreplaceable tapes."
325,"I have a standard issue Dell desktop, with the default AMD sound. Nothing fancy, but 3.5mm analog headset mics have always worked great for me. This mic, however, cannot produce an acceptable level of volume. I tried multiple applications, but I always sounded like I was talking from the other side of the room.And here's why you shouldn't buy this if you have a cheap sound card: I could not change the settings enough to compensate. I set my mic level to 100 (max), but because I have a cheap sound card, there was no ""microphone boost"" option like I've always seen for the analog mics.This mic possibly works great if your sound card can support it. Me, I went withCyber AcousticsStereo Headset/Microphone, Ambidextrous design AC-201because it's analog, and it sounds just fine."
326,"These sounded great and felt really good for extended wearing. It provides awesome sound isolation. The bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days. the v6 provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy. the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn. other than than, these sound great. The downside is that the hinge is plastic.  I hope they will not snap after prolong use."
327,"UCB cables are indispensable items in the 21st Century. You need them quickly? You get them quickly! Excellent product, excellent service, excellent speed."
328,"Over 20 years ago, I had started working at Circuit City and I wanted to buy a good pair of headphones, especially since I got an employee discount of store cost.  :-)  I tried on all the headphones on the rack, not listening to anything; I just snapped my fingers and listened to how well each headphone muffled the sound.  The Sony MDR-V6 pair did the best job.  Based on that, I bought them.  Imagine my shock when I listened to them and realized that they gave me better sound than my actual speakers did!  Over the 20 years since then, the padding disintegrated, and in my last move, they got... um.  A bit crunched.  I was heartbroken, as I remember Sony replacing the V6 with a far lesser pair of V600 headphones.  They had (I thought) renamed the V6 and tripled the price.  Not so, apparently!  I found my current pair of V6s right here on Amazon for the exact price I'd paid for them (at cost, remember) back in 1987!! (9/20/13 Edit: I bought them for sixty dollars both times; I've seen them go 50% higher on Amazon, but as long as they are less than a hundred, they are still worth it.)If you have any desire to hear your music without distraction, if you want the headphones that professionals use, if you want to have sounds coming at you that you cannot even *hear* but more feel, then buy these headphones!The sound quality is unparalleled in its price range.  Even going double or triple the price does not guarantee you a better pair of headphones, but there are some at higher prices.  Point is, you don't need to go that high for top-quality 'phones.  The 10-foot cord may seem like overkill, but when you need to get up from your chair to close that window, or answer the phone you left on the cradle on the other side of the room, or to look out the front window to see whatever, you will appreciate not being tethered.  Those ten feet equal freedom of movement that couples with phenomenal sound.The phones even let you do that little thing you see professionals do in those shows, where they flip an earpiece over and hold it up to their ear without putting the band over their head!  Or, flip one *while* it's over your head to enable a friend to listen to what you're listening to!I have read some people saying that these phones are uncomfortable.  I cannot imagine how that is possible.  The padding is quite comfortable (if short-lived in the earpads), and they manage to be snug without being constricting.These are, of course, NOT headphones to be worn while exercising unless you really want your ear pads soaked in sweat.  But that aside, these honest-to-goodness studio monitors will faithfully reproduce any sound you can throw at them, and never give you distortion from having the music turned up too loud.  You may go deaf from it....  But it won't be distorted!  :-)"
329,"Returned all three units I purchased for my office.  I tried to connect three brand new PS2 Adesso keyboards to our Dell PCs, but they all resulted in horrible screen errors and stuck Ctrl keys.  Returned for a full refund."
330,Standard nikon 52 mm fits most older and smaller lenses . Rotates for best effect for the lighting . The quality seems good in the image  taken with it . I would recommend it .
331,"This Netgear product is very well known for blowing two internal capacitors within 12 mos. of purchase.  Just Google ""GS 108 blinking lights"" and you will find a long list of hits.  Mine failed Christmas morning.If you do buy it, go ahead an buy a soldering iron and some capacitors so you can fix it when it fails on you too.No more Netgear for me."
332,"I wanted to get a better signal out of my tv cable, so I bought this amplifier. I did not get the result I wanted. so, I bought another one from radio shack, same gain and connected two of them in series. There is a small change, but still grainy pictures."
333,"I don't know if a good wireless speaker even exists. Despite being very pricey originally (almost $300) the quality was really mediocre, poorer than FM stereo. If you are looking for high fidelity, wireless is not going to please you, especially not these. A hiss/hum was always present, even at one foot away. When I went outside with the speaker reception was horrible. With just fifteen feet-line of sight, the speakers (i bought two) constantly would emit pops. At about a year the receiver would die and require the plug be pulled beofre it would work again. Eventually it would die faster until the reciever would work for less than 10 minutes, then went out entirely.A wireless set would still be nice, I miss it, but I don't believe Sony is any better than others. Sony also puts only 90-day warranty on a lot of equipment now. Even THEY don't have any confidence in their manufacturing."
334,"I bought these in a local store probably in 2002 or 3. They've made it to/from many lans and halfway across the country. They are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time. Never once have I had a complaint about these. Great sound and great build, don't hesitate to purchase."
335,"The product description says, ""Reliable L plug for improved durability and reliability"", plug on the one I received is straight."" The picture also shows an L-Plug. The ones I received has a straight plug. Why is this important? Because straight plugs are notorious for defects and guess what, I have no sound in the right earphone after one use. I had to request a refund as the sound is horrible when you can only hear it form one side. These are very cheaply made, I guess they stopped making the version everyone rated as 4-5 stars."
336,"I thought these would be good for running, but they aren't if you have normal size ears.Pros:-long cord?Cons:-hard plastic that goes in your ear-the ear pieces are way too big-always fall out, and are looseThese headphones suck, just don't buy them. I was trying to use them for running and biking (both outside and stationary) and the headphones would fall out constantly. Also, they were always loose, so I could never hear the music anyways. The inside of my ears would also tend to get sore since they're pretty hard plastic ear pieces--come to think of it the outside of my ears would hurt too. Luckily they were cheap, but do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY."
337,"I consider myself rather tech savvy. I've had this router for about 2 years (mainly because I don't own the modem we use, nor do I pay for the internet so I don't really have jurisdiction on it), and it's been /somewhat reliable/. It worked great for the first few weeks, then something happened. I don't know if it fell out where it was standing or something, but ever since it emits this terrible high pitch noise that only young people can hear. It's like having a CRT TV on (when theres nothing playing on it), except like 50 times louder. I've grown used to it.Anyways, this router does what it's supposed to. It routes information and does wireless. It doesn't do it that speedily though, and IT DROPS CONNECTIONS LIKE CRAZY. It sucks. Downloading anything large is impossible because it breaks the download, watching netflix is a huge pain... Never going to be going with NetGear again (Going to buy a D-Link tonight - sorry Cisco, your products in recent years have been sub-par). Never would have went with NetGear in the first place if I was the one who bought the router.The unit also gets pretty warm.Final Take: Don't buy it. Get something else. Obviously N is here but if you just want wireless (G) avoid this one."
338,"I can't stand those tinny earbuds. I bought the best ones I could find for my Droid 2, and they seemed ok, for awhile.  Then I purchased the FIIO D11 and paired it with these headphones. What can I say...it's awesome.  The FIIO on low gain, with EQ set to zero, my droid volume as loud as it would go, makes these headphones loud. Really loud. At high gain, they're too loud. But even then, there's no distortion. None. The sound is crisp and clear.  Drums sound like you're standing in front of the drummer. It's like you're on stage. Just like the other reviews say, you can hear things in the music that you don't even notice using the headphones mortals use.It comes with a nice carrying bag. The bag has a drawstring. It's a nice, leather or faux leather bag, but with the drawstring I can't put the extras in without worrying about them falling out in the wrong place. But I didn't expect the bag, so who cares? The phones fold up easily, and quickly, and won't take up much carry-on space.These phones are really comfortable. I was worried that they would sit ON my ears, but my ears fit nicely inside the cups. And it's easy to adjust them for a perfect fit.I have a trip coming up in a few weeks, and I'm looking forward to putting these on and rediscovering my music collection. I wish I was leaving right now!I highly recommend you get both items in this review, if you have a droid and want quality sound.  Without the FIIO, these phones are probably loud enough for most people. Even on an airplane. They sound as loud to me as my tinny headphones did, but without sounding crappy. Like I'm sitting in my living room listening to a quality stereo."
339,I use these every day at work. Comfortable. Great sound. Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal. I almost never need a 3m coiled cord. I'll probably follow one of the excellent DIY cord replacements online.
340,"OK.  I already owned a Sony dvd recorder.  But I needed another unit for the bedroom so decided to try the Philips.  Took it back after two days and got another Sony.Problems:- doesn't read and write many formats- the menus use strange hieroglyphic symbols - I for one prefermenus in plain English- you use the remote for certain things, then have to go up to the unit to read the display for other things- interesting bugs - for example, half the time, if I wanted to record a two hour show it worked fine.  The other half of the time, it would turn off after recording after only 10 seconds.  Tech Support said this MIGHT be fixed in their current software upgrade... they'll send it and I should have it in about 10 days.- the manual was really poor.  It was at least in English, but was very vague.Nope.  I dont think so.  For just a little more money, you can have a MUCH better unit."
341,"I bought (and then returned) four bags before staying with this one.  Is it perfect?  Of course not, there's no such perfect camera bag.  Backpack?  Sling?  Rolling?  Shoulder?  I wish there was one that had the benefits of all of these, but it doesn't exist.  The backpack I had been using is wonderful for having both hands free, but it doesn't hold enough and when the ""Kodak moment"" came along, I had to wriggle out of it, put it on the ground (regardless of how messy the ground might be) and then zip it open to get the camera out.  Whoops - my subject was gone.  The 5612 is heavy when full of my gear, but I don't have to leave anything out and I can get my camera out quickly when I need it.  Like all Tamrac products, it's made of strong materials and can take a beating."
342,"I've been using these for many years, mostly for playing music during workouts.  I am a fan of really high end headphones (Sennheiser 595s) and, although my Koss phones aren't quite up there with them, they really do satisfy.  Great bass, great presence and you could run over them with a car and they'd still work.  When I bought these (more than ten years ago) the dealer (whom I trusted) said ""these are the best.""  He was absolutely right.By the way, I recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as Koss Porta Pros.  Happily, Koss hasn't changed a thing.Tom Hurley"
343,"So I was very excited to receive my item in the mail, paid a lot more than I normally would for a screen protector at 30+ but loved the thought of having some privacy around the office especially when I have saved all year and actually spent some money on the laptop I have now. HOWEVERwhen I received the case I and opened it and read the instructions it had &#34;clear&#34; plastic tabs (They look like folded up tape) that you STICK on the side of the laptop and slide the privacy screen in and out of them. Wish there had been a picture of these plastic tabs on their display pictures because I wouldn't have bought it.And also to make it easier to pull in and out I guess there is a dip in the screen about half the size of a quarter so your screen is only 99% covered, there is a small cemi circle of visibility also NOT ON THE DISPLAY PICTURE. (Maybe if my screen was a little shorter this wouldn't be a problem but my computer is a true 15.6 in) Needless to say this really cheapened the laptop and I wound up just giving the screen protector to my sister.**Note, my laptop has a black frame, maybe if yours was silver or even better white you wouldn't notice the tabs but on black it is really noticeable."
344,"This device is great in concept, and this particular model was an excellent choice a couple of years ago.  The concept is still great, but there are better choices out there than this one.  The main problem is that the technology is out of date.  Being purely 802.11b, this still runs at 11Mb/s best case, and maybe half that speed in actual use.  There are other 802.11a and 802.11g options that are several times as fast.Other specific issues I had with this model, and the reasons I say it's quirky, are:a) It couldn't connect to my access point unless the access point broadcast its SSID.  If both devices have the same SSID this shouldn't be necessary, and is less secure.b) If you want to use a channel other than 6, you need to change it from infrastructure to ad-hoc mode, change the channel, and then change it back to infrastructure more.c) It couldn't connect to my access point if the access point was in ""mixed 802.11b/g"" mode.  I had to switch the access point to 802.11b only.If I were to buy another wireless bridge I'd get one that's 802.11g compatible."
345,"Yep read the other posts, I am going to go check out the iGo Juice.  Our Apple Extra Portable 65W Power Adapter is total shot.  It is now dangerous becuase you have to wiggle it so much in the wall jack to get a connection it is a hazard.  And my kids use the imac the most"
346,"When I got my ipod, I found the Apple earbuds to be very uncomfortable and they had poor quality sound--especially on the bass end. I upgraded to the Fontopia earbuds, and I loved them. The earbuds were very comfortable (except for the weird asymmetrical cord), and the sound was wonderful. The Fontopias had clear, crisp, full-range response.Alas...after only five months--a full 60 days after the lame 90-day warranty expired, the earbuds lost all sound in the left side. I jiggled the cord and sound was temporarily restored, albeit with static and distortion. For what these cost five months ago, which was about twice what they go for now, I am very disappointed and more than a little ticked off that they died after just a few months--especially because I only use them at home when I read in bed at night. That's hardly serious wear-and-tear. Time to shop for something new and it won't be a Sony product."
347,"This is a jack splitter, works fine, and though i do have a use for this (thus the 3 stars), this is not what i intended when i ordered it.What i was looking for was a 3.5mm to RCA Stereo Female Cable, which is what the picture details, this is not one of those, this is merely a jack splitter, which in itself is fine, however if your like me and aren't overly experienced in tech terminologies, you might look at the picture and purchase the wrong product like i did, so be aware of what this is.The product is 5 stars, however amazon get's 1 star for not showing the actual product, and thus the 3 stars."
348,"Final Review as of (02-07-2012) AVOID THIS PRODUCT.Bought this at Wal-Mart yesterday.  It does black & white prints fine.  The scanner is okay, except the scan bar has no depth perception and you get lost focus around 1/4 inch away from the glass, so no scanning watches or flowers.  Now onto the bad things.  Firstly, the color rendering is off.  WAY OFF. A fix is to firstly install the FIRMWARE UPDATE through ""Kodak's AiO Home Center"" in the Start Menu under KODAK.  Once installed the duplexing should work ""slightly"" better (not chopping off an inch of your print jobs on pageflip). With the default install, you will have severely desaturated reds (about 1/4 the saturation of an onscreen or scanned red color and your blue colors will be muddy.  Then for the second part of the fix, in the ""Start/Settings/Control Panel/Printers and Faxes"" click ""KODAK ESP Office 6100 Series AiO"", then click ""Preferences"" (not Printing Preferences).  This will bring up a window with 7 tabs on top, click ""Advanced"" then in that tab ""Print Processor"", click ""NF EMF 1.008"" (you can alter the COLOR MANAGEMENT color space profiles, but this printer will only use an Adobe colorspace or the default sRGB even if you've set it differently).  After this your reds will be deep and less like a faded pale orange color.  Your colors will still suck though as your reds, finally being actually red now, will be too dark and unsaturated.  If you are using IRFANVIEW 4.30 as your image viewer, then you need to go to Color Corrections and bump the saturation to 192 to 225 (about 88% more) and then you will have a reasonable color match to the reds you see on your screen and that is with blowing out the contrasts to heck on the reds.  Using the KODAK special paper might automatically print normally (given the yellow pattern indicating that it is Kodak Paper), but I am using plain paper and this should not be a problem on any reasonable desktop printer.  Note that I've skipped over the failure to resize booklet pages properly (although they do print in the correct order and orientation) and the problem with the automatic paper feeder for the scanner on top, but that is because I am limited on text in review posting and the biggest problem needed addressing first.  I have not used the fax part of the printer or the WiFi.(Had 3 image link examples to Imageshack here, they were removed when the review was posted - filling in space with color examples that users can duplicate onscreen)Note that the paper output looks fairly close to the onscreen version, but I have to desaturate the newly scanned image by 1/4 to get match to the printed image (it increases the red amount in scanning).  This is also not a perfect color match as I've only had the printer/scanner/fax for about 24 hours to try to work past its quirks).  This also shows that the printer CAN print proper red colors, but it either refuses to or the colorspace matching is horrifically bad.  The red of his boots should be 75% red, 27% green, and 25% blue (RGB 190,70,65)as it is onscreen, in the first print the red is either underprinted or shifted too high to the 78% red, 64% green, 56% blue range(RGB 200, 164, 145) range.For example, if you print a tomato red color from the screen RGB (255,0,0)or (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) HSL (0, 240, 120), the color this printer will output will be closest to RGB (255, 165, 165) or HSL (0, 240, 198) in short, AWFUL.Adding onto my review a few weeks later.  Still no fix for the awful color rendering from Kodak, the SCAM of ""If you run out of color ink, the printer will REFUSE to print black & white prints"" is proven TRUE.  In short, the printer would be tolerably great, IF the Kodak company's management could stop the self-destructive SCAMS against their customers and get the engineers to properly get their hardware working.  I will not purchase another Kodak product again until they clean up their act and stop the SCAMS.  One quick Firmware fix would undo most of the problems with this printer/scanner combo, but from what I see, Kodak desires all of their now-former customers to flee angrily into the night and tell their friends and everyone else on the Internet (you know, THE ENTIRE WORLD) about the products that should technically perform correctly, but are prevented from operating properly thanks to Kodak's anti-customer managerial SCAMS.The hardware still allows this product to remain a great printer, it just needs some HACKING to disable the criminal Kodak Management SCAMS, to fix the color-rendering incompetence, and so the hardware performs as it was sold to me on the box.  Avoid this product until someone competent HACKS it to make it act properly.  I would suspect the horrible color rendering is ""Magically Fixed"" when printing on Kodak's expensive pre-printed (yellow dot pattern) paper, which again is ANOTHER SCAM.  Get your act together Kodak or all the money in the world won't save you from the growing anger of your cold betrayal of your customer's trust and the devaluation of your brand name.Final Update on this review - Ink Usage and Costs.Well, the red no longer prints at all and ""cleaning the printhead"" only wastes ink. Of the pages I've printed recently using a brand new standard black ink cartridge $10 and a brand new standard color ink cartridge $20 here are your results. Black cartridge reported ""Empty"" with 24 text pages black ink at 15% coverage, 24 pages black ink graphics at 20% coverage, 10 pages color at 80% coverage, 2 pages color calibration with 40% coverage, 2 ink cartridge cleaning cycles (reported online to waste 25% of the ink each usage). Small wonder the scam company of Kodak is going bankrupt (no more cartridges in the future kiddies) and I say GOOD RIDDANCE."
349,"Let me just preface this mini-review by stating that I'm not an audiophile, so in terms of these headphones on a technical level, I can't say much.I can say, however, that I had decided about two years ago that I needed headphones for my computer, and so I went to J&R; Music and Computer World to try ones on.I tried these, and they sounded great to me, again, being a non-audiophile, and they were extremely comfy.Here it is, two years later, and the headphones still work fantastically, are still comfortable, and still sound great.They're not noise cancelling, however if you have loud music playing, odds are you won't be able to hear your roommate shouting at you from behind. In addition, since I can tell the difference between say, a 256kbps MP3 and a lossless version of the same song, I can still notice the same difference on these headphones. Yes, this is a matter of audio compression, but the point I'm trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression don't go unnoticed with these headphones.Very highly recommended."
350,"Bought these for my son's MP3 player.  They worked great for about a week, then one of the wires came loose and they were dead.  Try explaining that to a 15 year old.I would not recommend them."
351,I thought this actually recoiled.  I did not realize you have to hand wined it up.  It does not wind up easily.  It is actually hard to do and the case is much larger that I thought it would be.
352,"Technically this product works, and once you've setup it will just do its job and you'll forget that you have it.But to get there is quite the hazzle. The install instructions are incomplete, and whoever designed the product made a lot of assumptions about your environment, which is most annoying.Unpacked the device - all the usual, device, network cable, power adapter, separate antenna, CD with software. Put everything together and installed the software, ready to configure the device. As part of setup the bridge needs to be connected via wired network to setup the WiFi parameters. But the software can't find the bridge and the error message is useless. Tried all kinds of things, no luck. A few Google searches later found out that the device defaults to a different subnet than my network is operating on. So had to go to my network settings and temporarily change my computer to a different static IP address and netmask to get the setup working. Then once configured, reset everything.End to end to get it working, 1 hour.There aren't many reaonably bridge bridges out there which support WAP encryption. But this is not a device for folks which aren't good with advanced network configurations."
353,"I purchased my Sony MDR-V6 headphones in my very early teens (if not earlier) after reading a review in Stereo Review (I believe). Since then, they've gotten tons of use and I've seen them everywhere. I've gone through 3 or 4 cords over the years and they're finally falling apart. I wanted another pair but settled (ha!) on MDRV600's, which are very muddy - all mids. They're going back today to Best Buy and I'm getting a new set of V6's from here -- I can't believe Sony has kept this model alive so long. These are incredible 'phones. Trust me.For alternatives, get the following:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AJIF4E?ie=UTF8&camp;=213733&creative;=393177&creativeASIN;=B000AJIF4E&linkCode;=shr&tag;=swiclu-20&linkId;=IRBSUAR6ER2W4QD7Fairly comparable of its range...."
354,"This is not great, but it is what you expect from cheap tiffen. I like it though and don't use a filter enough to consider buying again a more expensive (much better) hoya pro filter. And it's soooo much cheaper."
355,Had no problem installing these replacement batteries and they are an excellent value. Had to recycle the old batteries separately.
356,"When I first got this bag, I was so excited to use it. It has a good amount of padding on the inside and the bag itself feels durable.I purchased this on 8/13 and my zipper liners already broke. I can no longer use the zippers and they fell off track. I may have gotten a defective one but I would expect a bag at this price wouldn't fall apart in just a month. I hope customer service is good about this."
357,"I bought these because I was looking for a nice pair of headphones that sounded as good as the ones I remembered using as a kid when I had to listen to music through headphones while not disturbing my parents watching tv. Little did I know that Sony still makes the same model! That's right, some 18 years later, I now own my own pair of the exact same headphones. If the fact that Sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesn't say enough about these, then nothing I say would do much justice, but I'll try anyway.I have a 24"" head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly, I bought them anyway. Once I got them I did notice they are a bit tight, but since I have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on, this is not a concern to me. Plus, in time I expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use. The padding on the ears are very nice, but I can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying, but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears.Once on, I can't think of any other headphones I've tried that sound as good. For my desktop speakers, I use aKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)that sounds amazing when playing songs through iTunes or Pandora, so I needed something better than the Apple earphones I was using when I didn't want to blast out my roommates. The MDR-V6 headphones do just that. Of course they don't have the same punch as a floored subwoofer, but surprisingly, the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable.Until I bought these, I wasn't even really using the iTunes equalizer. Now as I change music, I change the EQ because the headphones make you hear sounds you've never heard before! I feel like going back through all my music just to see what I've been missing."
358,I have nothing to compare it to but it works great for my mixer. I wouldn't rave about this product or anything because it certainly isn't one in a million
359,"I enjoy this over-the-head headset.  I have tried over-the-ear and earbud hands-free units, but this is by far the most secure and comfortable hands-free style.  The volume control is easy to use and it has handy mute on/off switch.  No more finding the mute button and adjusting the volume on my Treo 650 anymore (pretty dangerous while driving).  My only complaint is the volume is a little low if you're talking to a soft-spoken person.  But it's tough anyway to listen to him/her without the headset, plus you can detach the cushion on the earpiece so the receiver is a little closer to your ear."
360,"It takes very nice pictures, excepting at night or dark places."
361,"The cases are fine but extremly fragile even if dropped on capet they break,so if you drop them on the floor or any hard surface forget it it's gone.  I estimate about 20 to 30 % you may break.  I don't see anything else better on the market so you just have to deal with it. ""Oh I will buy this product again""."
362,It does the job of providing the extra USB ports where needed (acts like a multi-outlet extension cord).However the &#34;special&#34; powered port for charging a phone did nothing at all.  No better than a regular USB port.
363,"The unit interfaces well with the Delphi XM receiver, but does not provide good sound quality. It sounds like a cheap radio because that's what it is. The speakers are cheap. The casing is cheaply made and my unit did not work with batteries as promised. The design is great, but the sound quality is very poor.If you're thinking about getting one because you ALREADY have a Delphi XM Radio receiver, then it's not a bad investment. But you may want to wait and see what the future holds because surely the XM Radio folks are going to provide us more quality units to listen to their great broadcasts."
364,"My remote came with my iPod when I bought 2 years ago.  The only time I don't use it is when I am using my iPod in my car, where I lay it on the seat next to me & have easy access. Otherwise my iPod is usually in its case, which is in a pants or jacket pocket, and so pulling it out just to change to another song is inconvenient. I often use my ipod while working, which means I'm doing things with my hands & moving around. So the overall concept is great. It features just what you would need to control in this situation: volume, FFWD/Rewind, advance/repeat a track, pause/play, and an on/off switch for the remote itself to prevent unwanted accidental changes when just listening. The remote is very easy to operate by holding in one hand and just using a thumb to select without having to look at the remote itself, which means I can get rid of a bad song or stop playing while someone's talking to me in a second. The only thing I could thing might be added in features would be a way to select a different playlist.  I need some length for the remote, since it needs to extend out of my pocket & clamp on to something, however the 2 together is just too long. The gripper that attaches to fabric is just too small & could be designed better. My preferred placing of the remote would be on the lip of my pocket just outside my pants' pocket. However the combination of the remote's tiny grip area & the thicker material of my pants, makes it difficult to keep the remote attached while in a vertical position & so I often end up attaching it horizontally to the lip of the waist of my pants, though it pops off if I have to bend over to pick something up. It grips a little better on shirt fabric, but then it's more in the way for me (since I'm often holding things against my upper half). The end result is that because of the long cord & slight gripper, the remote oftentimes comes off & droops way down, usually catches something & then the earbuds get pulled out of my ears. The other problem with the remote is that there is no reinforcement around where the cord enters the plastic connection plug & so the wires end up getting exposed after 6 months, and sooner if you wrap the excess remote cord around your case.As for the earbuds, I used to really like them, except after having gone through 2 pairs. They sounded pretty good initially, but after a few months I got buzzing in one of the ear buds (perhaps from the cheap metal covering getting bent). Apple replaced the first, but then said I'd have to pay $10 for another. So I ended up getting the Sennheiser 400s (which are $10 here). They just arrived today & I must say I should have upgraded to these earlier. They sound a lot better then the original earbuds & they come with a storage case (the other drawback to the earbuds).So overall, the features of the remote itself are indispensible, though its design can be improved upon. However the price is a bit hefty, particularly given that the earbuds only last a few months & better quality ear buds are available for less."
365,"A classic example of ""You get what you pay for.""  Inexpensive, but very breakable.  I would not buy this brand again, but at about 25 cents a piece, I guess I should not have expected much quality or durability."
366,"Worked fine, just not for very long."
367,Okay. Can listen but they are old school and not my wife's favorite at all.  They fit not well and just play.  That is the best I can say.
368,"Very comfortable with good sounds high through low. They do cut out at anything 40 hz or below. So Hip Hop will be thin in the lower range. Jazz, Roxk, Classical, And more...they are very comgfortable and snug. Great for walking, beach with Tablet or Phone"
369,Wish I had listened to the bad reviews of this product. The batteries charge for about 15 minutes every time and didn't last long before I had to charge them again.
370,These have become the preferred headphones of choice for tracking. I wasn't expecting much when I picked up a pair of these on Black Friday for $40. I've had numerous people google these after using them to see where they can get them in town quicker. These are the real deal.
371,"All I can say is that it is reasonably priced, designed specifically for this camera, has space for another CF card and battery pack, and it even has a belt loop. What else could you ask for? Buy one!!!"
372,"I beg to differ with other positive reviews here. I'm using a 700mhz iBook with OS X. The operating system saw the device right away, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality, however, was much, much worse than my home CD Player/NAD amp/B & W speakers. The sound quality out of the Xitel unit was very close to the sound quality coming straight off the analog headphone jack of the iBook. My thought when I heard the unit was, ""[a few of my hard earned bucks]something that boosts my levels a little, but sounds no better..."" I'm sorry Xitel, you'll have to do better than this. Try at least to sound as good as a $50 portable CD player, and then I'll be interested."
373,"I purchased the Terk Leapfrog to control my Tivo from the bedroom, after running cables for the audio/video through the wall.  In the end, this has worked excellently for me - so let me explain why it doesn't get the full 5 stars.Initial setup with this product couldn't be easier.  You simply unpack the two pieces, plug in the two included AC adapters - and that's it!  I was surprised there was no programming it to accept certain IR codes...  it just picks up whatever the remote might be throwing out, and relays it appropriately.  When I first unpacked it, I set the one unit right in front of my Tivo, sitting about 2 inches from the Tivo's IR receiver.  I took the other one into our bedroom and plugged it in.  Presto - I could control the Tivo from the bedroom.Now that I'd confirmed it worked, I went back to my living room to try and find a nice, out of the way place for the Terk Leapfrog to sit.  It obviously had to have a clear line of sight to the Tivo... which I figued left me with plenty of choices.  I tried putting it on a bookshelf, that was on quite an angle from the Tivo - but with no luck.  I tried hiding it behind a picture frame (where is still had a clear line of sight to the Tivo) on a table that was closer to the Tivo... but again no luck.  I went on to try 4-5 other places around the room, but could never make it work consistently.Finally, I placed it *behind* the tivo, and used the included IR 'extender' (which is a little cable, with a peanut sized IR transmitter on the end).  I snaked this little cord under the tivo, and then attached the little IR transmitter so it's aiming right at the Tivo's IR reciever.  This, finally, worked.  Just for comparison, I can aim my Tivo remote almost anywhere in the room and have the signal picked up by the Tivo, so I'm confident that the Tivo is not the problem here.So...  The good thing about this product is that it does work...  the bad thing is that it seems it needs to be aimed by a professional sharpshooter to get the signal to your device.Pros:-Super fast setup-Works great with your TivoCons:-Hard to get the 'placement' of the IR sender just right."
374,"Purchased this battery as spare battery for my Canon G7. Mainly used original battery during all my trips / shots, and used this one just 4-5 times during last year (charged it about 10-15 time just to make sure there is emought power just in case OEM baterry is depleted). Noticed also that Digital Concepts BP-2LHCL-C 1500 mAh bettery can't hold power as the original Canon battery does even this one is ""1500 mAh"" as opposite to OEMs 800mAh.So, just a week after first year I checked this Digital Concepts BP-2LHCL-C battery and found that it is completely dead! No power, you can't charge it, nothing. And it is no longer in warranty.I need second battery because, you know, every moment is unique, If I can, I would like to capture this moment before its gone. That's why I will never purchase cheap ""replacement"" battery for my cameras and camcorders. I'm going to buy original Japan-made Canon battery at Amazon. Yes, I know, it cost 3 times more, but I know it will work for years and I can rely on it.Do yourself a favour and purchase OEM battery."
375,"This remote may be one of the most versatile you'll find. With so many new TVs and formats, remotes quickly become outdated. But since this is programmable, it's just a matter of entering the new codes and you'll have a remote capable of dealing with TVs, DVDs, VCRs, or whatever else you throw at it.However, those unlucky enough not to have TVs wtih published codes might face some challenges. Most of these codes are published on the All For One website, which offers the info free for download. Not unfrequently, however, you may be forced to make a telephone call. From there, they do their best to look up your media player and provide an accurate code. Perhaps the main failin of the All for One is its unability to intelligently ""look up""  codes - a function you'd expect from a smart remote. A few other universal remotes have this, and their convenience is upped enormously.This remote uses three AAA batteries; it's strongly suggested that you convert to rechargeables, and simply swap cells once every two weeks or so."
376,"The Sony headphones aren't anything spectacular, they're just alright.  I notice some crackling when I hook them up to any device, but they're sturdy and compact.  I just put them in my purse and go."
377,"I replaced an old USB hub with this new one expecting MORE power with the new 2.0 hubs.  I was not able to run my USB Scanner from this new HUB.  It is only useful for small items like Mice, Keyboards and MP3 players.  It is not a bad product just don't expect to run everything you buy for it."
378,Maybe nit Senhiesers but they are very good phone for the $.  This is the second pair I have owned in 25 years.  The first were destroyed by a new puppy in the house.  NOT DOG PROOF!
379,"I have the PortaPro, which I bought when it was selling for $50. The sound is incredible for something in this price range, but I feel embarrassed using it in public, even though savvy audiophiles know it's cool. So I got the SportaPro. It's sounds as good. But it's not quite as embarrassing to wear.UPDATE:After nearly a month of use, I can say that not only am I pleased with the SportaPro, I favor it over the PortaPro. While the sound quality between the two is about equal, I find the SportaPro to be more comfortable, especially for wearing for a long duration. I've addressed the aesthetics, but I'll reiterate that I feel a bit embarrassed when I wear the PortaPro, in contrast to the SportaPro."
380,"I'm able to use a Sony NEX VG10 with this adapter. I've done lots of playing with it and used it with Takumar SMC lenses. You will get nice photos and if your camera has HDMI out, then you can monitor everything on a big screen. Comes in handy when I have family over since everyone wants a turn at the telescope."
381,"Just love them. They are loud, a lot. Sound crispy and the bass is great. I use them for my desktop and the long cord let me move free. I recomend these a lot. ps: they get a little warm on your ears.Update: After using them for one year, I have to say that all my other headphones sucks :P . The sound of these V6 are way wayyyyy better than any other I ever had. Watching movies with dts and my V6 it's just awsome. I'm very glad I got them."
382,"...and this C-maker confirms that.  It makes the basic coffee without fuss or spillage and the hotplate doesn't scorch the coffee for awhile after brewing.  BUT, the basic BD c-maker I bought in 2007 had some problems:1.  The illuminated power switch, identical to the one pictured here, broke--it just fell out.  Bear in mind that I am a gentle user of my kitchen equipment and I don't make coffee more than once a week on average, which means that for the daily user, it might not live past the 13th month.2.  Blackened Ecker assembled it with screws that require a special screwdriver not sold at your local hardware store, which says to me, don't fix it, trash it, buy a new one to replace it.  I drilled out the screws, cut off the power switch and spent less than $5 for a beefy new switch and a washer--fixed. BD has rubbed me wrong with its ""You can't fix this"" attitude--Fis-It-Yourself users shouldn't require a drill to open up the thing.3.  Your basic flunky, cheapo coffeemaker really shouldn't cost more than $20, no matter where you buy it, or what the brand.4.  Well, you just wonder what will break next.  If the carafe breaks, I doubt I'll find one suitable for the model I have.  That condemns me to buying a new CM."
383,"I had this camera for a week and had to return it to the store. I liked its look, controls, picture quality, colors, menu, battery life, accessory options. But when I played-back my tape on the TV, I was shocked with high-pitched metal noise. I first thought that it's the tape, so I tried another tape - same result.When you remove tape from the camcorder - there is no noise, there is also no noise when you switch to VCR mode (not playing your recorded tape), but once tape is in and you are ready to shoot, listen: it hums and whistles, quite but steadily. And when you play it back noise becomes NOISE. I have read re-views on cnet.com, but I thought it just some minor motor noise you can here on almost every camcorder - not the case!! I had Sony-hi8 before and I know the difference. I think it has something to do either with flaws in videoheads or tape mechs, or with bad placement of the mic.Of course I could buy an external mic, but do you want to carry it always with you - at home and on the trips?, and besides it makes the camcorder much bulkier.(2 stars are for picture, but sound ruins the rest)"
384,"Headphones are highly personal devices, so don't be surprised to see wide variances of opinion.  In fact, I have yet to discover an &quot;all-purpose&quot; pair.  Imagine an equalizer board with 8-16 slider switches adjustable in any number of configurations.  Boost the treble and upper mid-range while cutting back on the bass and you have the Panasonic 850's, which are perfect for concentrating on Ella's voice or Tony Williams' ride cymbal but not on Nelson Riddle's orchestral arrangements or Ray Brown's bass.The Sony MDR-V600's may be as close to a &quot;universal,&quot; accurate set of headphones as you can get for under a hundred and fifty.  Compared to my MDR-6's, which my son &quot;borrowed,&quot; they're more comfortable and the sound is more &quot;flat&quot; (i.e. accurate, faithful, undoctored).  If your tastes extend beyond contemporary pop and you're serious about sound &quot;fidelity,&quot; beware of those &quot;DJ&quot; models, with the bass boost, brain-shaker and virtual-reality features.  And as a previous reviewer has pointed out, this model is identical with the higher-priced &quot;professional&quot; phones Sony is listing as model 7506.  Perhaps Sony plans to make the 700's the only available models (call it &quot;cost-effective marketing), because there are currently some great deals on the MDR-V600's.My only &quot;complaint&quot; is the extreme degree to which the V600's seal off all outside sound, making me feel like I'm trapped in a cocoon (they're ideal for anti-social or solipsist personalities).  These phones are a pleasure now and then, but I'm still happy with my Sennheiser PX-100's for 80% of my listening."
385,"These phones sounded very neutral which we're great for listening to our studio recordings, but they did not feel very sturdy on the head.  Seemed like the head band was too loose or uneven."
386,"I received the changer as a requested gift to replace a Technics SL-MC410, which was great btw, just not enough capacity. The only improvement in the Sony is more discs, but the only initially perceived benefit was it's ability to play mp3 discs. This is where the first major problem is: the lag time between tracks is HUGE. Playing mixes is incredibly frustrating. Even changing from disc to disc is infuriating, it takes longer than any changer I've used. Also, to add discs or even open the door requires stopping the item playing at the time. Overall, the capacity is impressive, but do NOT purchase this item based on its ability to play mp3 albums."
387,Did not successfully link the Presonus Firestudio firewire 400 to the Macbook Pro firewire 800. No problem with a firewire 400 connection to older Macbook (FW400). I have not tried others.
388,"These CDs are the worst performing CDs that I have ever bought!  After encountering problems on almost all the two 100 packs that I bought, I did some research on what a quality CD would be.  It was decided that Sony was the only CD that we could depend on for copying audio to CD-R.  Other name brands that have better quality cost way more but Sony is the best for the mid to low grade discs that we must have.  With the last order I switched to Sony and have had no problems at all.  I do not know if Memorex checks their quality but Maxel discs have perform okay but Sony is the best in the price range that we can afford.Amazon, most of the 100 pack CDs arrived with the case broken.  You may want to check your packaging to be sure that they are protected.  Otherwise, your service is okay."
389,"These have huge ear cups, making them extraordinarily comfortable. The cord is much longer than most, giving you a lot of room to move around. For the price, nothing beats these. As a side note, I wear hearing aids, and even with those in, these are still roomy and comfortable."
390,"If sound quality is more important than aesthetics, use a casette adapter.  Tangled wires and all, at least you'll be able to hear your music without having to force your passenger (or yourself) to hold on to this crappy little device, constantly angling it for optimal reception.  It works only where its available bands won't be drowned out by even the faintest radio station.  If you live in a city like Los Angeles, where every available band is used, you're out of luck.  I'm not returning it because it will come in handy when I rent U-Hauls and such, and my friends, who don't know it sucks, think the looks and concept are pretty cool."
391,"This is a great lens. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish I would have purchased it with image stabilization. Being so long & heavy, there is quite a bit of camera shake when handheld. But, if you don't have the extra $500 to spend then it's a great piece of equipment. There should be no issues with using it on a tripod."
392,"I was worried that the cord would not stretch long enough to reach my detector but once I took it out of the box I stretched it across my chest and my span is over 6', so its plenty long enough. I fired up the detector with it and all was well. Now Im safer from radar guns."
393,I tried hooking it up to my Denon amp.  Would not work!  Made sure protection is on and still would keep tripping the amp to shut down.  I think this cheap thing ruined my amp!  Looked up in Amazon to return only to see it is out of its return date????  What the ##@!*  Didn't know I had a certain amount of time to get a return for a defected product.  I would have tried it out sooner.  Very disappointed.
394,"It picks up lots of RF noise.In the digital age where a cable either works or it doesn't, it's easy to forget that analog cables are different. Cheap analog cables sound bad. This one sounds awful."
395,"The very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge. I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10"
396,"I did not expect much. I thoight to myself, what should I expect for less then $25 a pair. Oh my God, with the correct persoonal ajustments to your MP3 player, the sound is NO LESS THEN AWESOME. THE SOUND IS CLEAR  AS A BEEL RIGHT ACCROSS THE SPECTRUM. If you are not careful, the bass wil completely blow you away. I have ear phones that cost upwards of $300 + and they do not come close. They are comfortable and stay on your head at the gym not matter what part of the circut you are on. Buy them and then buy some more!!! I am not kidding After I finish wring this review, I am going to order two more pair. Oh yes, buy the extra foam ear-pieces."
397,"I bought this to improve the reception of the ANT110, a much cheaper model that had good reception overall but I wanted much more. I spent $30 for the ANT301 and overall it was not worth the cost. I plugged in the amplifier and it actually made things WORSE. But when I removed the amplifier I got much better reception, but the $20 ANT103 is the same thing with no amplifier so it has similar reception. If your looking for great reception go with Trek's version but if you are looking for decent reception go with the ANT103. For this, avoid it, it's overpriced and the amplifier is worse than a push-pin."
398,"I purchased these headphones for their ability to block outside sounds during my commute.  While they are good at this, the sound they produce is terrible.  There is way too much bass -- you actually feel the physical pressure on your eardrum with every beat.  At the same time, midrange and treble are very muffled.  There is also noticeable interference between bass and treble -- whenever there is a bass beat at the same time as vocals, the vocals fade out and distort for the duration of the beat.  Compared with the crispness of the standard iPod earbuds, everything sounds as if you're underwater.With that said, when I set the equalizer in iTunes in a steep stairstep pattern, reducing bass and increasing treble, the sound was great.  Unfortunately, custom equalizer settings do not transfer over to the iPod (regardless of what model you have), and none of the preset equalizer settings come even close to making the sound acceptable.  So while these headphones might work with an MP3 player that supports custom equalizer settings, they are useless with an iPod.  Bottom line: If you at all like the sound of the earbuds that come with the iPod, even if you wish they had more bass (as I do), these headphones are not for you.  (And if anyone knows of a pair of in-the-ear headphones that have clear mids, detailed highs and aren't so biased in favor of the lows, write me at [...])"
399,"About six of the cases were cracked when I opened up the package.  Not sure if this is an unfortuate shipping issue or if they were originally shipped that way.  Otherwise, the rest of the cases were fine and for the price it was still worth it."
400,I recieved this remote control without any instructions. Try to use and activate the camera but without success. I've read the Nikon D40x camera manual but again there is not a word of how to set up this remote control. I've returned this item. Very disappointed!!!
401,"great product by Belkin, everything that you need is n here. the only thing that I dnt like is the soldering Iron, but overall is outstanding."
402,"Purchased this to use when working on systems...... I also wanted it so that as I moved around on my chair mat between monitors, drafting table, external usb devices etc so that i would not have to ground myself each time.  The cord is well made.  I gave it four stars for one main reason.  The stretch cord could be about a foot longer.  The clamp works fine and stays on the metal ground I am using.  The velcro strap is a tad tight.  I am a big guy.... not heavy just tall.  The strap just barely fits my wrist.  I would have preffered they use a bungee wrist band... but that is getting overly picky for something so cheap.  It does the job of keeping you grounded while working on the internal components of anything and does the same as I move around in my chair.  My floor pad is not anti-static so just moving around between systems etc.... builds up a charge.  If my chair had any metal on it I would ground it to my chair.  I am going to try and run a screw into the bottom of my arm rest and ground it there.  If that works I may just cut off the alligator clip and hardwire it to my chair.  I will give it a try and post back later if it works."
403,Works fine for what it is proposed to do. However I wish it had a 1x lens to focus onto. Not sure if it was me or the lack of lens but only way i could avoid see the guts of my telescope was to use a Barlow.
404,"Does the job, and reasonably priced at $1.99.  Using it for a ham radio application, and it seems to work well, with little extra noise introduced."
405,"This may in fact be a fantastic video capture card.  I purchased it because I wanted something cheap to transfer a couple things from VHS.  Silly me; I assumed that had standard RCA video in, and two sound channels, that just happened to all be colored yellow.  Nope.  The yellow here is all video... component video.  The non-yellow is S-Video.  If you want audio, you'll have to do that some other way, not with this card.Short story:  If you want something inexpensive that is ""just going to work"" on modern systems, that also comes with decent software, go with something like AVerMedia C039 DVD EZMaker 7.  That's what I got to replace this, and it's exactly what you'd expect, AND it has a USB interface with Cyberlink software.  Yay.  I ate $25 + shipping on this ancient card, and I don't even plan on trying it out.  Maybe someone on an auction site wants it??"
406,"Basically this item comes down to the money to build ratio.  For the steep price tag, you would expect the item to feel durable, smooth, comfortable, etc...  But really what you get is an awkward, rough, flimsy item.I have had the Logitech Marble Mouse for quite some time and love it (although I would like a scroll wheel - hence why I got this guy).  I am going back to the marble mouse, because this trackball after two weeks has just been awful.  I figured it might just need an adjustment, but it really is not a quality item (ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE TAG).The feel is awkwardly uncomfortable and it lacks vista+ drivers (as many have noted).  Other than swapping left-click/right-clicks, you are stuck with the defaults of ""middle mouse"" and ""back"".The scroll wheel gets in the way here as you move the ball around - it gets rotated pretty easily.  Also, the wheel is not a smooth glide or even slightly rough - it really does feel like you're damaging it during use.Save the money and annoyance and get the Logitech Marble Mouse, they are getting rarer (as trackball users are few) - but they are great.  Vista+ drivers, four button customizable, and if you want scrolling - you can customize a button to initial the scroll.  Spend the extra 30+ bucks on some new ram [well, until prices started rocketing]."
407,"Had a pair of these that seemed to work great, so I bought another pair for my wife.  Headphones are simply better than speakers, especially great for blu-ray audio.  Anyway, it started on my headset first.  when I went to adjust the volume only one earphone would work, rolling the volume dial would eventually give you stereo.  Then the volume would not work properly.  If I played with it I could get it to work, but not without using the headphones with a dial rolling ritual first.  A few months later the same happened with my other set.  Looking at the reviews I seem to be in the minority, but ""two"" sets with the same problem?"
408,"I used an 880 to hook up my A/V equipment: a TV, DVD player, VCR, amplifier, and an XBox. There was a power outage in my community. After power was restored, the VCR and XBox would not power up. Everything else connected to the 880 worked fine. I had my VCR and XBox checked out and both were fried by the power surge. I submitted a warranty to CyberPower and got a new 880 in the mail immediately. The warranty process was very smooth and very quick. CyberPower paid me 50% of what I originally paid for the VCR and XBox. Their warranty clearly states that they will only pay fair market value of the damaged equipment.On one hand, I can't recommend CyberPower because I got a defective surge suppressor. But on the other hand, the warranty claim process was pretty smooth. I was lucky I kept the receipts for the 880, my VCR, and my XBox. I definitely wouldn't recommend connecting your most valuable electronics with this surge suppressor. You should consider a UPS even if it's just for surge suppression. The circuitry in UPS is much better quality-wise than surge suppressor outlets."
409,"Bought this product along w/ matching auxiliary battery pack BR24BP based on APC's Selector - an online app which asks about your equipment then recommends the products you should consider.  The Selector gave me bad advice for my MacPro.  I was never able to completely ascertain what the mismatch was about, but threads I found suggested it was either ""inrush current"" where a waking computer's current needs spike momentarily OR something to do with this APC unit not producing a ""sine wave output.""  In any event, any time the APS unit was needed to step in due to an electrical outage, the waking of my sleeping Mac immediately overloaded the BR1500 and everything crashed.  I returned this unit and replaced it with APC's Smart-UPS 1500 and have never had another issue.  Bottom line: APC's Selector needs an overhaul. The two stars aren't meant to say the BR1500 is necessarily a bad product, but rather that its suitability to task was NOT what the Selector said it was."
410,This is great lens that i use all the time. There is only one problem i had and that is dust.  After less then a year i got one big peace of dust on the inside of the lens that cost over $100 to have removed.As long as you take care not to let this happen it is a great lens to have.
411,"These cables were the result of a search to locate a USB cable with the lowest voltage drop due to internal resistance.  They've performed well in this regard, better than any others I've located."
412,Someone told me that Plantronics was cheap but I beg to disagree!  Yes; the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is great.
413,"What's to say... it's an anti-static wrist strap!For those unaware, the shocking truth is that electronics are very sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). It might not seem like it, but a discharge too small for you to even notice can be enough to damage a printed circuit board (PCB).As your body naturally builds up a static charge, simply touching the motherboard inside your a computer can discharge several thousand volts of electricity, more than enough to cause permanent damage. The damage done can be total (computer just never boots again) or subtle (strange, difficult to troubleshoot problems that plague you from then on). An anti-static wrist strap is probably the most common measure used to mitigate the risk of frying your computer when you need to work inside and touch the components.The idea is to wear this strap around your wrist, which has a metal plate (a conductor) that makes contact with your skin and attaches to a cable with a metal clip. When you attach the clip to the bare (unpainted) metal case of your computer, or something else metal, you effectively ground yourself by making the static electricity discharge harmlessly. You can achieve the same result by simply touching a metal part of the case periodically as you work. Not wearing fuzzy socks and scuffing across your carpet on your way to work on your computer on a dry day helps, too. There are also other solutions, such as anti-static mats (for working on as well as ones for standing on).Warning: some so-called experts will tell you that the whole ESD thing is a myth and will tell you they've worked on computers for years and never used one and not seen a single case of ESD (if these so-called experts live in humid climates, ignore them outright). I don't want to engage in polemics, but I will just say that being conscious of ESD and taking measures to prevent it from damaging your equipment is a best practice for a reason (there's no large, mega, anti-static bracelet industrial complex profiting from this). However, ESD damage (assuming it exists) can be difficult to prove. I've seen two cases of it; or, at least I think I have. I can't prove it was ESD, but it seems likely. Why risk it? Ground yourself and you don't ever have to worry about it.Another Warning: still more so-called experts will tell you that leaving the device plugged in (but turned off) while you work on it is just as good, because the power cord has a ground. Well, maybe there was something to that argument back in the day, but modern electronics very rarely power off fully, even when fully ""off"". You'll notice glowing LED lights on your PC motherboard even with the system fully shutdown, for example, and that indicates small amounts of power are flowing. I believe working on a system in that state generally not a great practice (very easy to short something out in that cramped space by momentarily dropping a screw or not watching where your screwdriver tip is).One thing you can do, however, is ground yourself via the ground in a wall outlet. This strap has an alligator clip, which is nice but like all such straps sometimes becomes difficult to find a place where the clip won't keep coming off the case. I discovered that the clip on this strap is removable, leaving a plug behind that fits perfectly into the ground hole of a three-prong American power outlet. Theoretically, this is even better grounding, not that this is necessary.This strap also has another nice feature: the cable connects to the strap itself via a metal snap button (like a coat button). This way, if you forget you're attached to the case of your brand new $3,000 gaming rig and walk away, the cable will (hopefully) detach at the button rather than pulling your system and all your dream off your bench crashing onto your floor.But these are all pretty standard features. One thing I wish is that the strap itself was elastic, rather than Velcro. But that's not a big complaint. Again, this is a pretty basic item, but essential in my toolkit."
414,I gladly returned this item. The picture quality was aweful due to noise. The instructions say to move it away from the TV if this occurs but if 2 feet won't do it that's unacceptable for my application.
415,The cable works fine but it is impossible to get the end out after it is stuck into a piece of equipment. I was certain I was going to break something the first time it was removed.Now I carefully hold and brace whatever the cable is stuck in like a router and have to jigger the cable head back and forth until it suddenly releases and pops out with a jerk.I would not buy this cable again. I just know I am going to break the router trying to get this cable out of it.
416,This filter worked well for me. I searched for a good polarizing filter to used when shooting Koi ponds and a lot of them cost hundreds of dallors. I ordered this one and it worked great!
417,"This is the cream of the crop for greyscale Palm-OS organizers.  Runs all of your palm 3.5 apps, can add a cellphone module or wireless network module to be connected on the go.  8 megs of ram is good for everything except carrying a library or alot of Avant-Go (offline web).  I'd highly recommend this to most people; however, if the extra 13 Mhz isn't important, save your cash and get a Palm-IIIxe, with 8 megs of ram, flash-upgradable O/S (handspring O/S is in ROM to save costs), and is much cheaper (pricewatch listings around $180)"
418,"I bought these as a replacement to the cheap headphones I received with my three tone detector, which lasted about 18 months of on and off use as I use ear buds in the summer heat. They are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit. Although I have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where it's out of the way. These are EXACTLY the same as what other retailers offer, but without the camouflage, for $30 less. Oh, and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly, windy weather. The only negative I can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesn't get stiff in cold weather. If they did that, I'd give them 6 stars."
419,"As a bit of background, I use this in my bedroom with my TV, which is only 8 feet away.  With that said, I still get a lot of static on these headphones, when they work.  Since it's line of sight, I have to look at the TV just right or I get a lot of static.  Recently, I will get a surge in volume and then speakers just cut out.  When this happens, I need to unplug the power on the base and replug it back in.  Not happy with this product."
420,"Good things about this camera:1. CHEAP2. very lightweight (though not particularly small)3. Nice quality lensBad Things:1. In even moderately low light (like a room with windows on a nice day) the camera still needs the flash.  Without it, the pictures come off blury and off color (even with white balance adjusted).  Expect to take ALL indoor pics with a flash -- ditto for outdoor at dusk.2.  Very little in the way of manual settings. If you switch to ""manual"" you can choose from some preset whitebal adjustments (e.g. incondescent, flourescent) and make some minor adjustments to whatever the camera judges is the best exposure.  BUT none of these settings is available if you want to use the self timer.3. MEMORY IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  This camera uses Fuji (and Olympus) new ""XD"" memory.  It's smaller and not particularly fast.  It also costs three times what regular digital camera memory (FLASH) costs.  So tack that [X]  premium back on the price.I got an amazing price on the camera with coupons and such, but I'm still returning mine because sometimes I'd like to be able to take a good picture without that flash look. (You can manually disable the flash, but the pics just don't look good without it)."
421,"The good part is that I can rely on Sony for making a product that has great sound quality in a small package.  It is elegantly designed so as not to be lodged in your ear with an annoying fuzz protector that collects earwax, but rather plastic that slides naturally within your ear, and then handles that keep it steady around your ear, rather than wiggling about.It is easy to fold up, and small enough to slip in your pocket, as well as producing high quality bass boosted sound that often makes my computer speakers seem tame!By far, it is the best earphones I've ever had in life... about four or five times in a row.Just like another reviewer, the EXACT SAME PROBLEM has occured to me in EVERY SINGLE PAIR I'VE OWNED!  For about $10 lowest retail price, $12 dollars highest, these things have lasted at least 3 months, and at most a year, until the LEFT earbud simply shuts off.  The wire leading in to the earbud either comes loose, or dissolves with use.  If I held the wire at odd angles, the earbud would work, but otherwise it is simply finished.My first pair was blue.  The second was orange.  The third was blue.  The fourth was black.  The fifth was lime green.  This last one, which broke the record for how long it has lasted, was blue.  Not one of these pairs have lasted longer than a year (except for the most recent pair) and they have ALL SUFFERED THE EXACT SAME ISSUE---THE LEFT EARBUD BREAKS.In some cases, it had been justified---one pair I had was crumpled in my backpack, causing the left earbud to come apart---but it STILL worked.  For most of the others, they had endured no rough conditions that normal earphones shouldn't easily rupture from.  Even airport headphones have lasted longer!For ten or twelve dollars, this is simply a ripoff.  While I had the same earphones for almost eight years now, I have ended up spending almost 60 dollars for it, in the end.I'm still sticking with Sony earphone products, but never again this one."
422,"I'm not a heavy user, but just from this microphone sitting on my desk it managed to break at the base. It still works (although the stick no longer stands up and just lays down) so I had to give it a -3 for lack of durability."
423,"I thought I'd ""splurge"" and spend the extra bucks to get a heavy duty machine. I've always bought the little $10 models, which last only 3-4 years at best. This Kinyo Commercial rewinder was broken right out of the box. Dead. Nada. What a disappointment. On the bright side, though, Amazon has the best return policy in the world. What a company!"
424,"My cable company dropped their support of this router.  It's out of date!  There are a lot of newer models out that would be better suited. The price is good, and it did work great while we had it, but in our case it's not even useable anymore.  We ended up sending it back about a week after we had it and bought a newer version."
425,"It works, but the alligator clip can be made so it doesnt scratch the paint or metal when you clip it into something."
426,"Great portable headphones for the price. Well balanced sound, nice mix of treble and bass, not too much of either, just right.  Build quality is okay, I am not a fan of the metal headband, but overall they seem like they will last for a good while."
427,"We have had this for some time, and it is working fine on the printer. We needed additoinal &#34;length&#34; to relocate the printer, and this cable is filling the bill."
428,"The unit is fairly compact, but certainly not pocketable. The screen is reasonably nice and so is the audio along with the 20 GB HD capacity. The problems lie mainly in totally inadequate and clunky software, which has to be updated on-line right after purchase. It is very counterintuitive and extremely deficient. One cannot even perform the simple operation of zooming in and out on photos. They can only be displayed in one, fixed size.Alhough it seems logical to be able to load DVD movies into the unit, that has proven to be impossible. It might be done with an MPEG4 encoder (which RCA did not see fit to include), but straight out of the box - forget it. Since the video playback feature is by far the main atraction of this gizmo, a serious oversight like this renders it practically useless.It might record off a TV set, but frankly that seems like too much of a hassle to me. I would much prefer to do it through my computer's USB 2 port. In short, the Lyra is going back to the store. Hopefully units such as this, will soon be available in an improved version and for less than $400."
429,"I have to say that this lens is maybe the most fun lens in my bag.  It's tack sharp, with good color and contrast.  I use this quite often with theCanon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite for Canon Digital SLR Camerasand results are flawless.  I've also used it for on-the-spot portraits and with a great f2.8 max aperture the bokeh was beautiful.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is Canon's continued refusal to provide a lens hood with their non-L lenses.  I bought theCanon ET67 Lens Hood for Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lensseparately which was pretty pricy, but makes a big enough difference in sunny conditions to be a ""must have"" item.Update 12/4/09:  This lens is one of the most fun lenses I own, but now theCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLR Camerasis out and, since I do a large amount of macro work, the IS is a must have.  The new lens has got nothing but good reviews, so I've sold this lens to a friend to pay part of the bill for the new one."
430,"I owned my Jornada 548 for about a month before I broke down and bought a keyboard. After laying out about $500 for the Jornada, another $100 for a peripheral seemed pretty steep ... until I started trying to use the handwriting tools (not bad if you have consistent handwriting habits) and the on-screen keyboard. Neither seemed to work really well for me, so I broke down and bought a Targus keyboard. It really has worked well for me, but it's not as good as it could be.The concept is great - the keyboard folds up to the size of the 548 when it's not in use, but unfolds to the size of a laptop keyboard when you're ready to use it. The keyboard has a connector that sits at about a 45-degree angle and plugs into the Jornada, plus a little metal bar and plastic piece that supports the Jornada when it's plugged in. There is also a place to plug in a power supply so that you can keep your Jornada plugged in, and two small wells in the corners of the keyboard to hold a stylus.The keyboard itself works well, with function keys for some common commands across applications (OK, Esc, power off) and other keys that can be programmed to start up specific applications. In addition, certain characters like the forward and backward slashes (/ and \) cannot be written in the single-character recognizer because the stylus strokes are used for other purposes, so the keyboard helps take care of that. Because the keyboard is laid out like a laptop keyboard, you don't need to relearn most of your typing, as long as you remember that you can't use function keys like you do on your laptop.One thing it won't do, however, is select menu items with shortcuts, as you can do in Windows proper, but this is a Windows CE issue, not a keyboard issue. Another slight drawback is that the Jornada interprets your use of the keyboard as using the on-screen keyboard, so it displays the on-screen keyboard for you, which then takes up the lower third of your screen.I've also had a couple of issues with the keyboard - one is that the support for the Jornada is not great, so you have to use two hands to turn it on with the power button, and the other is that the keyboard occasionally freezes up. I've been able to correct it either by activating the special keyboard application, disabling the keyboard, and re-enabling it, or by using the on-screen keyboard to type a letter. Neither is a real show-stopper, but they certainly are annoyances.Overall, the keyboard is a great time-saver, and it will certainly draw attention, especially when you fold it up and store it. The size of the keyboard and PC combined may be a drawback for some, and the way in which it works could be a little better. I'd still recommend it if you intend to do a lot of typing on your Jornada."
431,"I bought it, charged them, etc.  But they never worked.  Not sure if it was the charger or the batteries, just returned them for a refund."
432,"The macro feature seems cool, haven't figured it out yet!  No page down button for digital cable guide, but I bet I can custom program a button to do it!  Cheap price, great company, I expect it will perform more as I use it more.  Very eay to program."
433,"I cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is!  You have to have one!  It will change your life in so many ways--the photos are wonderful with great resolution, movies are exquisitely wonderful!  The sound is just fine.  I love using the diskettes.  The lithium battery is great also--lasts a long,  long time prior to recharge!  All problems of older digital cameras have  been solved with this lovely piece of technological work..."
434,"It is a memory stick, there is not much to say about it. It did not fail or destroy any of my data, which is about all you can say about such products. I'm still a little hesitant about this price point for the product, in comparison to other formats 128 MB is starting to become a very small amount.  One note: it is not translucent purple as it appears in the image, it is the dull purple-blue of all of the other Sony memory sticks."
435,"So now..........FINALLY I have the chance to review a Product that single-handedly took out almost 1/3 of my total cd collection at one felt swoop!! And it DID! I have been a more than avid music collector since I was 9 years old. I am now 60 years old, so that takes in a LOT of territory, believe me!! I also am very eclectic in my musical tastes, so I have a LOT of differing forms, and kinds of music. But I shan't get too far from the point here.I purchased one of these Sony 300 Count Cd Players several years back, when I upgraded very seriously; ALL of my A/V equipment. This was a counterpoint to the Sony Receiver that I bought, and it was plenty steep in the price range. I was impressed because it would afford me the chance to use my collection much like a ""juke box"" all of my own, and this WAS before downloads were all the craze, and mp3's were just making a crack in the music world via largely to Sony. At any rate, I got into the cd craze Very Early into it's introduction, and I had quite a few cds by the time I got this unit. MORE than 300 cds, but still, a very substantial amount of my also FAVORITE cds were put into this Player, for the reasons I stated above.In short, BEFORE it EVER reached the one year mark of ownership, this Product malfunctioned so badly, that it broke, and also deeply creviced a very large amount of seriously scratched cds, so that there was barely 20-30 of them left after realizing that, in an effort to save them, I would have to take ""the hood off myself"" even if it did dewarrantized the Player itself. It didn't make any difference, the damaged had been done, and the cds were totaled, at least the majority of them were.I have ""tracked"" this particular item that Sony STILL obviously makes, all these years later, online, and in Big Box Stores where they still carry them, and I can tell you ONE salient FACT! It is NEVER ""if"" this particular Sony Model is going to malfunction, it is ONLY a matter of WHEN, and just how badly the malfunction will affect the cds that are in it. I have watched the Reviews of this Changer over many different websites, and online, and inevitably, someone else, usually SEVERAL owners; report the same thing about this Product, over, and over , again and again. It is like watching a train wreck happen, and you couldn't stop it, even if you KNOW it is going to occur. It's an awful thing, and Sony has had countless reports of this happening numerous times over the intervening years since it first was introduced to the public, ( as I was in it's first year of marketing ) and it's always the same, and it hasn't stopped them one whit from continuing on making it, so that MORE unfortunate occurrences of it continue to plague buyers, who don't know what they may be headed for. ( i.e. see ""other reviews, one and two star....... right here on Amazon.com )Just possibly, it might make someone who doesn't know what can happen, and does, all too frequently, NOT mistake in buying it.Some of the cds I lost back then are irreplaceable, they were dropped from labels, and not picked up by other bigger ones, etc. in short, no longer available, some not even in vinyl, if you can find them, that is. If my Review, along with the other Reviewers herein, stop someone from sharing a similar fate, then it will be well worth it. I was a first year model-buyer when I got this, and I wish I had been able to be forewarned, it might have made a difference. And then, maybe NOT. This is just a well-intentioned ""Let the Buyer Beware"" warning, and I see that I am in some ""good company"" as well.LynnLuv59"
436,"My Mp3 jukebox came with a similar behind-the-neck style headphones that I really liked so I thought I'd try these Sony ones. I can't say enough for the sound quality...for a relatively cheap set of headphones, it's really excellent. However, the headphones were really uncomfortable for me. They were quite tight, but more of a problem was how sore my ears got wearing them. This may be because I wear glasses, or maybe due to my smaller-than-normal ears, I'm not sure. I just haven't had trouble with other similar headphones before. I even tried removing the extra ear grips these have (nice for if you are doing something really active). That did help some, but I still couldn't stand to wear them. I'd recommend them for the sound quality though, just be aware of possible problems with comfort."
437,"I had used some previous Trendnet spoolers in the past, primarily the USB Print Servers, and found them very easy to use and configure.  We had a similar style (maybe identical hardware inside, actually) D-Link that failed, and I ordered this to replace it.  What I found was that instead of using RAW/9100 standard for Generic Servers, it used an LPR with Spool Designation configuration, which was unnecessary on a single port server like this.  Regardless, I am returning the product because no matter the configuration method -- manual or using their wizard -- the printer ALWAYS prints garbage characters.  We verified the printer was working correctly through cable-printing, and used another older-styled and larger HP spooler to test, and everything is solid.  Their website does not contain firmware or support for this v3.0 version of the hardware either, or even acknowledgement that revision exists."
438,"I archive backups to my system on these and so fill the disks to capacity.Every time I tried to fill a disk it would fail.This is trash.BTW, I tried them on my wife's laptop and same thing."
439,"I have never written a review of a product on Amazon.  My wife's parents purchased this webcam (year 2007) so they could Skype with us.  Those poor people were sold garbage by someone trying to get rid of old, useless junk by selling it to people that don't know any better.  Thanks Logitech for selling crappy products in 2003 and thanks sellers for letting people buy crappy products 5 years after they are obsolete.Video:  Grainy, always green."
440,"Good product.  The floppy disks worked fine as advertised.FYI, I bought an External USB floppy drive to write these disks in the modern PCs(mostly for reprogramming BIOS on old motherboards)."
441,This worked exactly as expected so that I am not tied so closely to the computer or tablet when I need to use headphones.
442,i purchased this cable for a brother 2140 b/w laser printer because it did not come with one. this one worked just fine. it's been used for 2 months and have had no problems with it.
443,"This device does what it says it will do. I returned home to find it irreparably damaged, but discovered it was my older brother's mistake. Easily replaced for just a dollar or two."
444,Arrived on time.  Did not use.  Returned to seller since I subsequently purchased the same booster with 4 output ports.
445,"This camera has a lot going for it.  The first picture I took turned out great!  The camera is very user friendly which is good because the manual that Sony provides is not very well organized or well written.I find  the floppy disk storage to be easy and convenient. The camera allows you to  make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of  photos with friends on the spot.The Mpeg movies are a fun little add  on.  I am taking the camera to England in April and I think it will be fun  to capture little movie clips over there.The rechargeable battery seems  to be adequate. I am planning to purchase the more powerful one that  provides longer charge.The video and audio cables provided allow easy  viewing of the photos on the TV set.The only  negatives with the camera  are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on (but no  other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful)  Also, the light  that leaks out of the window at the top of the LCD screen.  This can be  annoying in a dark room.Overall, this camera delivered the features  that I was looking for."
446,"Bought this flash about two weeks ago for use with my Canon Powershot G1 digital camera, and have been nothing but impressed with it. it mates beautifully to the Canon, although it does make it somewhat bulky. The bounce flash photography is beautiful, and the E-TTL system just makes you look like a total pro. I also look forward to using it for wireless flash photography.There are SOME things missing, however. Compared to my Canon 430 EZ flash, there is no LCD display. No flash compensation (but this isn't a big deal, since that's controlled from my G1). No strobe. If these are important to you, step up to the 550 EX. Otherwise, the 420 is a beautiful workhorse."
447,"I needed an inexpensive set of headphones.  Several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but I learned a long time ago that Koss makes the best headphones.  These headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time.  I wasn't concerned with getting the best sound money could buy.  If I wanted better sound, I would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones.  For what I needed, these headphones are the best."
448,"Awesome price, beats the Walmart price of $39 for same cable, but with fancy packaging"
449,"I needed to backup my new computer and create some discs so I got these figuring that I could make copies of things I had put off doing.  They are nice thin cases in a variety of colors.  I am not pleased because they have no title  papers,or whatever you call them to show what the disc has on it. Obviously this isn't my strong point.  It never occurred to me that they wouldn't, but then I haven't bought cases before because I always bought the cd/dvd's in cases.  Live and learn."
450,"These are very nice quality pads for dampening the vibration under your tripod. They also have the benefit of providing soft cushions with nice grip if you store your scope indoors on hardwood floors, etc. The only problem I have with them is that $40 is a lot for a round chunk of plastic."
451,"Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.Great value. Just buy them."
452,This adapter fit my game steering wheel controller and usb on my pc but Windows XP did not recognize the controller which is the only reason I purchased this item.  It may work with a different controller but my Logitech Wingman gamer steering wheel controller.  Maybe with an install disk it might work?
453,"This product can be very hard to setup, for example it will not run at all if the Windows Firewall is enabled which is an abvious security risk and at least in my case caused me to spend hours on the phone to various utterly useless Indian help desk people (&quot;Sorry could you repeat that?&quot;, &quot;Is there anyone there who speaks English?&quot;, on and on ad nauseum).  Eventually I only found a solution to my problem by searching the internet for problems other people have had with this unit.  There are quite a few - even Tech TV could not get their test machine working for their review.Also, the software that goes onto your PC that shares the music and pictures is by far the worst software I have ever seen from a reputable company.  The software will crash on a regular basis and whenever you start it up again you will have to reload all of your media which takes a fair few minutes - the idea you can just start playing music anytime you like just doesn't work.In other words the wind has to be blowing in the right direction with the planets in alignment before anything will even work at all.Having said that when it does work it does the job ok although you can only play MP3s/WMAs and not stream any other type of audio (for example internet radio).It just isn't worth the money or the time you have to spend messing with it make it do what you would expect it to do immediately."
454,Not sure what I'm doing wrong. There is no software that I can see to download. It came w/o any paperwork or directions. These days that's not a huge deal.I can now use computer in a number of rooms. But can't use them fully at the same time. If it's just info & emails probably. But movie streaming is interrupted if someone gets on another computer.
455,"Great Trackball, poor design. Using the Trackball makes you bend your wrist backward too much. The top of the ball is quite a ways above the table making it awkward to use. The Trackball system is excellent. The pad supplied does not raise the wrist anywhere near the right height to use this comfortably. You need almost a 2 inch thick pad. You could raise the area in front of the Trackball a couple of inches, but the unit is expensive and that shouldn't be needed."
456,"I bought this headset to use with my cordless phone system which I use with Skype.  I have a Bluetooth headset on my left ear, and I keep this one on my right so I can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while I am working on my computer.  I use only Motorola cell phones and Bluetooth units, and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired.  The Plantronics unit is wondeful; it's light enough that I forget it's there, and even half-deaf me can hear it well.  The adjustable hearing is great, as is the adjustable volume on the microphone.  I heartily recommend it."
457,"They've stopped making polaroid film, and the expected final availability (according to polaroid's web site) is the first quarter 2009. At this point in time, I'd think the main interest would be in artistic work with the film. Check the expiration dates, and get some before the era comes to a complete close."
458,"Well... sorry, but doesn't  really work as advertised."
459,"Although I haven't used all the functions on this remote, it is still functional for me.  The button layout is only fair and is difficult to switch between this and the Comcast remote that my hands are used to."
460,Not bad for the price. It's a Remote.Nice Feature. But Battery Drains too fast. Programming the Macros can be tricky.
461,"Bought this camera along with the accessory pack for my daughter as a college graduation present in May 2004.It recently dropped out of her purse into a puddle, it was in its case.  It worked initially, then stopped working.The company offers nothing to replace or fix this camera other than she can spend 150.00 to get a refurbished one or she can send it in to be repaired which would cost over 200.00.That seems out of line for a camera which cost 219.00 originally and you can get now for 175.00.They didn't even offer to look at it for no fee and give options for repair or credit for purchase of another canon camera.She was very happy with the performance of this camera and is devistated that all is now lost. I will be hesitant to purchase another canon product."
462,"These are by far the best headphones i have ever used. Agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time, but the sounds completely makes up for all that. The bass is perfect.. great treble and mids.No complaint what so ever."
463,"Had I waited, this would have been the one.  I have the Rebel G, and it has been a great camera.  Having worked in larger, non-automatic formats, I really felt kind of like a &quot;cheater&quot; when I got my new Rebel.  One roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me.  I have rarely been disappointed with my photos.  In fact, the only time I have been, I was really stretching my photographic wings, and had I read the manual more carefully, would not have been disappointed had I followed the directions.My sister-in-law bought the Rebel 2000 this spring, and I didn't think they could improve much on the one I have, but they did.  Trying to focus on confusing images, such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage, can be challenging. The 7 point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect.  I have learned to work without it, but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then re-adjust to the frame you want.Because the camera is so well-made, I will probably not need to replace it for another 20 years.  But---if it should somehow meet with an early demise, the improvements in the new Rebel 2000 would be very welcome!"
464,"I'm not a audio-hound. I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these. Other than that small inconvenience, I would highly recommend these phones, particularly to people who don't place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound. As a matter of fact, I am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radio."
465,I used this to split the audio from my iPad so my wife and I could watch a movie on the plane. I needed to gently twirl the connectors until we both got sound. I barely got it to work. This is going into the trash and I am going to find something else for our next trip.
466,"While these sound great, they are two heavy and squeeze your head to tight causing aches under extended use. trying to loosen them up makes them fall off easy due to the weight."
467,Excellent sound quality. Fits well over the head or from behind. Lifetime warranty also.
468,"I bought a 100-pack of these CD-Rs to back up my music collection.  I have used Sony DVD-Rs for a long time, always with satisfactory results.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for these CD-Rs.  Of the 100 I bought, the first four were automatic coasters.  Just to make sure it wasn't my source disc that was the problem, I popped in  a TDK blank CD-R and it burned flawlessly.  I have tried many brands of CD-R -- TDK, Verbatim, even Memorex and Maxell, with no problems ever.  Goodbye Sony, I will stick with TDK from now on."
469,"This tape did not last. I returned it. Did not last at all, was not worth my money. Sorry. I cannot recommend this tape. And I regret that, because I love Sony products."
470,"The adapter does not jumper pin 2 to pin 7 to allow recognition on Windows as a digital device. To do that remove the bottom of the sidewinder joystick. There will be screws under the pads on the bottom. Pry pads off with a sharp knife. Be careful!To remove the PC board to get to the wires, remove the two SMALL screws near the chip and a larger screw off to the opposite side. DO NOT remove the 4 screws arranged in a square. That will have the joystick parts everywhere!Once you can get to the cord wires, use a soldering iron to melt the insulation off of the dark blue and purple wires above the connector. They are next to each other so solder the two together. Then plug the joystick into the adapter and the USB into the PC. My XP recognized it then."
471,You know how noisy the NYC subway is? This product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement. Nice deep base too.
472,not much to say other than YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE ... buy a decent one for the extra $20-$30 bucks and enjoy the this multiuse filter
473,"The Sony MDR-v6 monitors are an overall good headphone.. I gave a review about the Sony's and felt there was a lack of feeling in the headphone sound, it's like the sound is designed.  I really felt that this is where the Koss Pro4AA standout.  I won't deny the fact that although the Pro4AA headphones won't sound perfect to the average ear.. the Sonys sound good across the board.  It could be the fact that the Pro4AA headphones encase my ears.. ,yet it's hard to describe.. the sound from these headphones sound rich and real.. doesn't feel artificial.  The main reason I purchased these headphones was due to their durable design and lifetime warranty, but also heard about their noteworthy history and lifespan.  I am looking forward to breaking in these headphones and burning some work hours with them.Will re-edit after 50hrs."
474,"yep, it's big and heavy. but this is the camera i keep coming back to after having it 6 years...i have owned an HP and a Casio. the HP stunk and the Casio is a tiny delight. but the Sony was my first.it simply works. well. simply. competently. not every computer around has card slots and having a camera that uses floppy disks has been helpful.it is especially good for pictures for eBay and email. good quality photos with a small file size.so, if you see a good looking, working specimen go ahead and buy it and give digital photography a try!"
475,"This battery set cost me only about 1/3 what a ""real"" RBC6 replacement set from APC would have cost.  While the ratings printed on the side of the cells were the same as the original APC cells, the cells did not appear to be quite as substantial,  I elected to reuse the fuse strap from the original RBC6 rather than the one shipped with the replacement because it was of thicker gauge.  The replacement set has ridden through several power outages since I installed it and did it's job just fine.  Time will tell whether the cases will leak or have other aging problems.  At the moment, I am satisfied and would probably opt to purchase this replacement battery set again."
476,"Cable arrived as promised, cable is obviously well made, I like the large thumb screws. Belkin has been around a long time and it shows in their workmanship."
477,"This review is to address the issue of these headphones breaking, and only that, because quite frankly I could go on for days about how well these headphones work for DJing and everyday listening.  Stuff breaks, this is a fact of life.  Cars break, dishes break, and even people break, these headphones are no different.  Expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive.  There's also a difference between breaking beyond function and a simple annoying break like the plastic cracking.  These headphones will surely enough one day die completely as in loss of function, but up to that point they will begin to fall apart.  The swivel housings are the most common thing to break but from reading the reviews here on Amazon it is as if people have never heard of Duct Tape or they are so appalled by the idea of $100+ headphones breaking that they refuse to do anything but complain about it.  The Pioneer HDJ1000s break, the Senheisers break, and if you can find me headphones that don't break then I applaud your discovery of solid titanium headsets that don't exist.This all boils down to one thing and one thing only, how well do you treat your possesions?  If you're like me and you don't mangle everything you own then a $80-$150 pair of headphones is a safe investment, because it will last.  If you just play wild shows all the time, wear these skating/snowboarding, throw them in your backpack, or whatever then you're a moron to buy them and expect them to not break.  Nowhere in the description of this product does it say these things are as solid as a tank.  It states that they're flexible (they are), have a good bass range (they do), and they're comfortable (they are for me but that's a personal thing).Don't be deterred by reviews saying these things break, because everything does and every comparable set of headphones is equally flawed.  The HDJ1000s get loose sliding fixtures really quick, the Senheiser 280s sound overall better but they feel like a plastic toy and really aren't much better.  If you're a DJ your options are the V700s and HDJ1000s, there's a reason they're the industry standards.  They are time tested and proven.  If you aren't willing to buy a few good pairs of headphones then DJing is NOT the hobby for you because you WILL break your stuff MANY times, not just your headphones.Well there's my rant, these headphones do EXACTLY what they say they do and for that I give them a 5/5."
478,"The Tivoli Audio Model One is nice looking tuner that performs reasonably well and sounds OK and I could recommend it if it was priced around $50-$70.  At the current sale price of $150+ this tuner is not recommended at all.  The construction quality is decent with a very nice wood finish.  Tuning is also fairly sensitive, but not more so than any other good table top radio.  The sound is simply too bass heavy and not really listenable for talk programs.  Pop music sounds alright but classical and jazz are simply too fuzzy due to the bass emphasis.If you can find one second hand for around $50 then maybe give it a try.  The current unjustifiable cost is due in part to Tivoli's popularity in novelty shops and high end department stores that sell overpriced gimmicky gadgets."
479,Not working. Doesn't work for activating video. I tried it with taking a picture and it doesn't work. I got what I paid for. Cheap.
480,"Installation of the DWL-650+ is a breeze. D-Link's install process and software is better than some I've seen. And certainly it's high-speed performance (when matched with a compatible WAP) is a benefit, and a cheaper option than other, faster wireless standards.I have used the card for a couple of months, and find two primary annoyances:1. The configuration software for the DWL-650+ doesn't support passphrase entry of the WEP encryption strings as some other wireless cards do, forcing you to type-in the strings.  And type you do... Since the software doesn't allow you to paste from the clipboard (perhaps you keep your WEP strings in a text file -- if you do, it'll do you no good with the DWL-650+). (I should note that if you allow Windows XP to manage your wireless connections, this is a non-issue, since you can paste into the Windows configuration dialogs.)2. For some reason, PPTP VPNs do not work through this card, at least with Windows XP.  I've tested it in two different laptops, and the results are the same... Attempts to use the remote network over a PPTP connection with the DWL-650+ simply fail for no particular reason. Switch to a different brand of card, same WAP, same VPN configuration, same laptop -- and things are fine. (I've read other reports of this type online as well, so I don't think it's just me.)All that said, I do like the native configuration software's ability to sniff out available networks (though once again, Windows XP can do this itself as well, but the native software does it better). And the card does seem to capture and hold signal to the WAP quite nicely, and better than other brands I've tried.So for basic use, the card is fine, and would probably satisfy most users."
481,I really like this little kit. I have been using it for about a month it contains what i need majority of the time. I did replace the flashlight with a mag lite. I would recommend this kit in general it's a good computer maintenance took kit.
482,"What can I say, it is what it states.I am a satisfied"
483,"and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice."
484,The quality of sound on these things is amazing. Good bass and amazing clarity. I am hearing things in my music I've never heard before!
485,"These arrived bent, so the two focal points don't line up. Yeah, they're high-powered, but unless you have crazy eyes that line up perfectly with how these are disaligned, they're pretty much useless. I threw mine away."
486,"After a lot of researching and hoping to find a good camera cleaning product, I purchased this. And it was quite a mistake. I have no idea how many hairs fell out within the first MINUTE that I began using it, but the pen's &#34;brush&#34; is significantly thinner, due to loose hairs. True, I did pull these hairs out, but I thought I would only be pulling one or two hairs out - the extras, you know? Turns out almost ALL of the hairs were this loose, and no matter what, I couldn't get the slightly longer hairs to disappear - apparently every time I attempt to clean my camera lens, loose hairs will come out. This is super annoying and I can't believe I paid this much money for a product that is of such poor quality (if the hairs were secure, the pen would have been fine!)."
487,"Do not expect too much out of the product. The adapter works, however its kind of flimsy. For the price however, I kind complaint too much."
488,"Got this to split the VGA connection on my TV so that I didn't have to keep swapping cables between my computer & Xbox 360. Unfortunately the screen is unreadable with this cable hooked up. Every screen has multiple shadows, and the colors are all screwy. At least I only spent $.99"
489,"To be fair, the falling off may be the lens - I can't tell. Basically it seems like there just aren't enough threads engaging. I am using it on a refurbished (by Nikon) Nikon AF-S 55-300 1:4.5-5.6. I have NOT tried any other filter on the lens.I  have the same filter in 52mm and have used it on 2 other lenses (18-55 and 55-200) and it seems to engage more than this bigger filter in the longer lens.As long as you get it seated and remember to twist the filter orientation in the direction of tightening the filter it's okay. I got it backwards and ended up unscrewing the filter (which only seems to be less than a full revolution - less that one full thread) and it fell into dry sand. It doesn't look like it got damaged but I just don't enjoy using it because of the high possibility it may fall off again.And, it's hard to get the threads started.Again, I haven't used any other filter on this lens so it could be the lens too, which is more of a question because the lens was refurbished (although the threads don't look bad or as though they'd been truncated somehow).As for the pictures, I used it to effectively remove glare from a water body. It seems to work fine (as does my 52mm which I've used a lot more). No complaints but I may not see differences between this and a B+W anyway. I can certainly see the difference between this and no filter. I'd buy one again. I think the Tiffen's are a great cross between results and price. When I start seeing artifacts maybe I'll spring for a B+W or other brand."
490,I use these headphones at home for casual use.  They are perfect for that situation.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this price.
491,"I had a Plantronics headset before, and they've definitely improved on what I already liked:  great sound quality--most people say they can't tell I have any background noise even when I'm in the car, and comfortable headset.I use the over-the-ear version of it so I can hear best, and they've added a mute button on the headset cord, as well as the volume control.A great value for the money, and hard to improve on for any price."
492,"These are a great pair for the price, ~35 cheaper than the MDR7506I have just started listening to the V6s and have had the MDR7506s for a little over a year.Honestly, you get what you pay for most of the time, except for the MDR 7506 and V6 cans. They both are undeniable stars in the headphones scene.The difference between the V6 and MDR7506 is very small, but there is a difference, both in sound (maybe my V6s just need to break in, but I generally don't believe in the break in process for speakers)The MDR7506 from the very beginning were absolutely amazing. Very natural sounding, great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music. I loved listening to some of the Eagle's stuff on them, they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums. They are loose fitting on the ears somewhat, keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable. The cable is very good rubber, limber and returns to it's shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched out.The V6s have an almost equally amazing sound, more bass response than the MDR7506. Seems that they lack (just very so slightly) the clarity of the MDR7506. Earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the 7506s. The cable on these is no doubt quality, and will last years under normal circumstances, but the 'nice' factor is not the same feel. The actual plug is just like that on the 7506, same screw on 1/4"" adapter, but the shell is nickel finished instead of black, and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated. Nickel is actually preferable, against popular belief, because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in it's life will have nickel plated contacts, and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching. Not really a problem in a clean, dry studio, but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mind.In the end, if you're looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind, go with the 7506, if you're doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod, the V6s are where it's at."
493,"As I listen to the digital crispness of Big Country, I wonder how I enjoyed digital music without an innovative MP3 player such as the HipZip! Here is how I feel about this wonderful device:Plus:Transfer speed - Quick transfer of files. Less than 2 minutes to transfer 15 songs.Simple - Instantly recognized in Windows XP as a HipZip, and I was up and running in seconds. Easy menu navigation.Value - With recent price cut and cheap media, this is a great MP3 player to take digital music portable.Quality - Solid construction, 5 year warranty on media.Size - Dimensions are perfect for me. Not tiny, but it is half the size of my portable CD player and fits great in my hand.Case - Excellent case, not a cheap throw in.Sound - Great sound quality, surpassing my CD player (with WMA files and new headphones, see below).Flexibility - Plays MP3s/WMAs/Audible content and is upgradeable. I have been using WMAs myself due to the excellent sound and better compression. I can get over an hour and half on one PocketZip with WMA.Rechargeable - Charges in 2 hours and lasts over 8 hours.Anti-Skip - It will not skip and in fact passed my &quot;mow the lawn&quot; test and jogging test. Reason for no skip is simple. It caches songs in 4MB of internal memory. Saves on disk reads and no skipping.Minus:Mechanical - Can hear the drive spin when it caches songs. Moving parts wear out.Obsolete? - Rumors of a non-backwards compatible 100MB HipZip and equally rumors of Iomega dropping HipZip altogether to cut costs. Buy all the media you need just in case.Display - Good info and layout, but very light and pixels in background obsure display. Hard to discern shading and icons.Real Minus!! (Cost the 5th Star)Headphones - Included Labtec headphones are painful on the ear and sound awful. Extremely tinny with no bass at all. Replaced with only a $14 set of Phillips headphones, and the difference was night and day. Shame cuz the sound from this player is wonderful."
494,"I use it to hold 16 rechargeable AA batteries and it holds them just fine. I only gave it 3 stars due to two design flaws; it holds the batteries loosely together and if you are in a hurry and don't zip it up completely the batteries will fly all over the place if you're not careful.  Also, if you take out a top set of batteries the bottom set will likely come out of there pouch and will be loose in the bag if you jostle it around a lot.  Over all, not a bad kit, but if you're into using a lot of batteries then you might want to look into hard plastic carriers."
495,"i've been buying these for over 10 years now.  this is my third pair.  no, they are not crappy.  i traveled to less than favorable places under less than favorable conditions and beat the ever living crap out of them.  a product can only make it so far.  i don't baby my stuff.  having said all that, i have no regrets.  i love these, they are so loud you can set them on the table in a room and still hear them on full blast.  i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break.  LOVE THESE"
496,"I got this device about two months ago, and up until tonight, it performed admirably. Setup was easy, I got my internet connection up and running in about 5 minutes, and got all my wireless security settings up and running in another 15.Up until now, it has performed well. However, its failure tonight and subsequent wading through Netgear's technical support offerings turned me off of this product forever.I was playing World of Warcraft, and after about an hour, my connection abruptly died altogether. No internet, I could not even access the router's internal setup page to check on its status. It seemed to be in some sort of hard-locked state. Rebooting it didn't improve things.I broke out the CD that came with the device, with the idea of looking at the manual (they don't give you a paper copy, it's all on the CD). Pretty basic stuff, checking connections, etc. The troubleshooting section was full of hints on how to make sure that it isn't a problem with another component in your system before daring to blame theirs. I have a more surefire method. My old trusty Linksys Etherfast cable/dsl router had no trouble getting me back online.So I went to netgear's website to download the latest firmware.With the firmware image ready, my next task was to get the Netgear device back up and running so I could access its setup page. I discovered that if I disconnected the WAN cable going to my cable modem, the device would actually stay in a usable state. If I connect the WAN cable, it seems to die within about 15 seconds. Ordinarily I'd suspect something to be wrong with my cable modem here, but my Linksys router has no trouble with it as I have been online problem-free for over an hour using it now, as I'm writing this review.Anyway, I got the thing to boot, and loaded the new firmware image on it, then restarted the router. I hit the setup page again, only to discover it has been replaced by a ""wizard"". The wizard was unable to get an address via DHCP, and so guessed that I use a static IP. Or at least, that is what I am imagining happened as it displayed ""we are now detecting your internet connection settings"" for several moments and then announced that I needed to enter static IP information.The thing that most galled me about this is that they don't provide a way to say ""no, that's not correct. I use DHCP. And where the hell are the rest of the menus I used to use?"" I discovered you can get to these if you forge static IP settings and tell it to continue. On the failure page that results, you can find a link that takes you to the ""basic settings"" section, which is essentially the menu system the old firmware used to set up the router.The summary of this complaint is this: the device and its associated software go to great lengths to make setup easy, and to minimize the steps necessary to get things running, *if everything is working.* I imagine many customers can just breeze through the wizard and get themselves online. However, if something goes wrong, the ""wizard"" is useless. For one thing, almost all of the technical support documentation's suggestions are impossible to carry out without fighting your way past the wizard into the normal configuration.So for now I'm back on my trusty Linksys, without wireless support, but given the reliability I've experienced between the two brands, I'm going to buy a Linksys wireless router instead."
497,"These headphones are almost indistinguishable from the Sony 7506 model, which may well be the most popular headphones in American recording studios. I have both. I think the V600s are lighter weight, so a little more comfy for long sessions, or wearing all day in an office or something.The cord attached to only one side is great. The phones &quot;seal up&quot; really well, with a true closed-back design. If you squeeze the cups shut together, you can just barely hear them, even if it's cranked up to bust your eardrums. This, in spite of the fact that they are plastic. You CANNOT hear the outside world when these phones are at normal levels.  When they're cranked up, somebody could be shouting in your face, and you'd think they were lip-syncing.Besides being well-sealed, and loud, these phones give a big, smooth sound that won't give you a headache or have you wondering what you're missing. As another reviewer mentioned, they're very efficient, producing a ton of volume with very little power - and it's volume you can stand, unlike lesser models that will hurt your ears at similar decibel levels.If you're looking for the pro version - it's the 7506, and only available at musical/recording outlets. Here, all you have to do is click that button, and soon you'll be listening to headphones that I'd buy again and again if I lost or destroyed them..."
498,"The experiences for people with product like this is all over the place because it will depend on the environment that one puts it in. This is an electrical product with capability to filter out electrical noises and power surge protect the equipments that connect to it. There is no magic here, pure sciences. It will do the most good in the worst electric environment like apartment or small home with few independent cicuits. If one have a microwave or vacuum cleaner running on the same circuit, it works great but it does not work as much mafic if there are no other power hungry appliances connect to the same circuit. Having said that, I would say that it is still a good investment for the thousands of dollars I put into the home theater system. The surge protection ability is better than anything less than $100 as it have protected my equipments from numerous thunderstorms and even a couple close lightning strikes over the years and it still works. It is also convenient to have the power outlets within the rack so one does not have all the wire running out of the back. I can honestly says that it probably  improves video quality some with clean AC power to the DVD player/receiver and the HD TV picture is cleaner and definitely less prone to power noises and voltage fluctuations. The audio quality coming out of my Yahama AV system if definitely better with less hisses and pops from the power noises and the power sub thumps nicely with no hums. The front panel also match the rest of the rack and the analog power meter is a nice touch. The LED could get a bit bright for home theater viewing but some electric tape will fix that or put it aside away from the TV screen. For a little over $120 including shipping, it is a bargain for me."
499,"Well, my computer didn't blow up so I'm assuming it did what it was supposed to. By looking at the build of it, and where all the components are, it should theoretically work. I'm not going to test it by trying to destroy my computer, and my only gripe is that it was kind of difficult to put on because of the way it was built (but I also have large wrists), so I approve."
500,"Title says it all.  At least on my 4 port unit.  From the start the ports were loose, and you have to move the cable to make a connection even when plugged all the way in.  When it works, it works good, other than the port connection."
501,"I had a difficult time getting this to work.  I installed the software and it printed at first and then sometimes very slowly, and often required rebooting.  It also required installing the software on each computer, whereas other products doing the same thing don't require this. I purchased a similar product from another manufacturer and I am very pleased with its performance."
502,"These may be a throwback to the seventies, but the sound is great. The only concern you might have is that they don't block out much outside sound and, since the cups are open, they allow those around you to hear what you're listening to if you really have it cranked up"
503,"Overall simple and good but after a few hours of use the right channel of one of two connectors stopped working...Maybe I was just unlucky. Otherwise, it's small, flexible and practical. Sound quality not affected."
504,"The advertised condition of this lens, &#34;like new,&#34; is very far from the truth.  Below is the ad for this lens.Items Ordered PriceNikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras 1 of: Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasSold by: Inexpensive Used Textbooks (seller profile)Condition: Used - Like NewGlass is pristine. Lens body is white, very rare. Small scuffs on tr... see more$1,275.00I have contacted the vendor and have been given the option of returning the lens for a full refund, but that would be inconvenient at this time.  The new lens is superior to the kit lens I had been using, and I'm going to need this somewhat better lens. However, there is a flaw in the mechanics of this lens that is problematic. The lens, when in M/A (manual/autofocus) abruptly unfocuses on the subject and will not automatically return, but has to be reset manually.  I've contacted Nikon to see if operator error is involved, but I expect that what I'll find is that the lens itself is quite old and on its last legs.The vendor, Inexpensive Used Textbooks, in an email, admitted that he/she had also had these focusing problems. Like New condition, not when the lens hood has deteriorating gaskets and the autofocus mechanism is not working."
505,"But the fact is, I use the automatic setting 99.9% of the time. It is a nearly a fool-proof camera that takes perfect pictures almost every time. (I own the Canon Rebel G - very similar to the Canon 2000, but purchased in  1998)And I hate to confess this too, but...I take photos professionally.  (people pay me for my photos and they are published in the print media and  on the Internet)Shameful, I know, but it's true. With my little Canon  Rebel, I put the little thingie on the automatic setting, point, pause (let  the camera make its best decisions) and then shoot. I then drop the film  off at the local camera shop. (first few times, I had to take the whole  camera in because I wasn't sure how to unload and reload the film, although  that's pretty easy too)When I pick up the photos, they are just  beautiful. Now, I have had to learn some hard lessons about camera flash  and shadows, but that is hardly the camera's fault. Experience has taught  me a lot, there.In summary, I am not a camera person. I don't *want* to  be a camera person. But my Canon Rebel has paid for itself many times over  from the photos I've sold. It combines the best of modern electronics with  photographic excellence.And it has a dazzling display of options for  those who want to play with all the fancy features. But for me - I'm  sticking with the automatic thingie.I would highly recommend this camera  to others.THREE different people (that I know of) have bought this  camera, after watching me use it and then seeing the end results. (under  the &quot;good grief, if she can take good pictures, anybody can&quot;  philosophy.)They were all astonished that someone who knows so little  could take such incredible photos.Only downside - it is a delicate  camera. No forgiveness factor on dropping it. I use the STRAP faithfully."
506,My wrists are not big at all. Maybe 5 inch diameter. The strap is just big enough to fit around my wrist comfortably. Product does work great though. The clip on the end holds really well.
507,"These headphones are pretty good as far as sound goes - not precise, but balanced. But they don't fold at all, and the earcups are held in place by a flimsy plastic peg in the design, which breaks quite easy, as does the headband. I've had three, then, and all pairs have just broken in normal transit. I'm upgrading to Sennheiser HD 280 Pros or Grados, which have much more robust construction. The cheapness of these guys just doesn't offset the fact that I need a few pair every year or so."
508,"You get what you pay for with this cord.  In other words, this cord is cheap and never worked for me.  The sound quality was horrible when I tired to use it in my car.  The sound kept on cracking and sounded like I was hearing the music down a tunnel, echoing and never getting the full strength of the sound.  Instead I went over to Sears on the same day that I got this cheap cord in the mail and bought a Belkin cord that works great."
509,"I bought this lens after much research and procrastination, it was expensive. I used it with my D80 and took several shots at with it over a weekend. The exposures were perfectly exposed,contrasty and saturated but simply NOT SHARP. Maybe it was the particular copy of the lens I got. I was disappointed and returned it. If you think you want this lens, carefully examine the return policy of the company you purchase it from, if it's not from Amazon. Some of the Amazon retail sellers have a restocking fee of 15%. At approximately $900, the restocking fee will cost you a hefty $135 plus shipping if you change your mind."
510,I selected this product to give me more vivid colors and reduce glare. I did not realize the polarizer would reduce my light levels so drastically. Otherwise I am pleased with the quality and the shipping.
511,I use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music.  Fantastic sound quality.  One of the best audio purchases I've ever made and I have three surround systems in my home.  Very pleased indeed.  Would buy again !!
512,"I've used the Orbit with scroll wheel for the last two or three years, and it's mostly served me well, as long as I keep it clean and don't eat fried chicken at the computer.  But I felt I needed to upgrade, because why not, it's America, get the one with more features.My first impression was that the Expert was well-constructed.  The wrist pad is substantially made, and the base seemed well-balanced and heavy.  I plugged it in, ignored the driver software for the sake of not installing more crapware on my machine, and it was immediately recognized and worked.But, three things made this thing a deal breaker.One, I thought a larger ball would make this better.  But honestly, it made it feel worse to me, less precise, and more work.  Maybe this is personal preference, but I felt like the smaller ball of the Orbit actually works better, was faster, cramped my hand less, and was much more precise.  With the larger ball, I tried cranking up the track rate on my computer, and just could not get the thing to comfortably work.  Maybe this is different for you, but for me it was sub-optimal, and maybe I needed to give it more time, but it was an issue.Two, the buttons on this button are a little off.  On the Orbit, if you put your hand on the ball, the left button is immediately under your thumb.  On the Expert, it's slightly below your thumb, which means you have to reach for it or take your hand off the ball slightly.  The upper button by default also requires a reach, but it's slightly more natural.  But the upper button by default isn't mapped to anything.  Maybe installing the crapware would let me map the upper button to be a left-click, but I didn't want to install the crapware.  The right button is the same deal, except instead of my thumb, it's my pinky.The real deal breaker though was the scroll ring.  I sometimes feel like I spend 90% of my day scrolling through documents and web pages, and the scroll ring is the biggest innovation to me, something I use constantly.  The scroll ring on the Expert was junk.  It didn't rotate smoothly, and felt like a cheap piece of plastic garbage.  It felt like there should have been some kind of lubricating joint or glider piece or something between the body and ring, and it was either missing or junky.  The scroll wheel on the Orbit was infinitely more smooth, even after years of use.  The ring on the Expert was almost useless.I returned the unit after about a day of use and went back to the Orbit.  Maybe this was just personal preference and the unit works great for you.  And maybe I got a bad unit and the scroll wheel is golden on other units.  But it wasn't for me."
513,This product is not sized for small heads.  It is too loose and there is one place on the skull where it puts pressure behind the ears that gets uncomfortable.
514,"Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!"
515,"I love it great for the price. If you have the money to upgrade to one of the better go for it . However, I was ust trying to find something to protect the glass of my lens"
516,"Bought these because of their range.  Glad I did.  Only problem I have is the cord.  It may be 10 feet long but because it's coiled you really are limited to where you can go.  Go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo.  Just need to limit your range.  No biggie.  I just move the chair closer to the stereo.Also, the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noises."
517,"Here's the deal.  I bought an 30GB unit on ...(another website)(upgraded with Toshiba hard drive) for ...($$$)shipped.  I've owned the unit for nearly a month, and I've got mostly positive comments thus far.  Storage capacity is excellent; sound quality great; easy to learn basic features; highly portable, ability to record voice and other data, etc.Negatives are its short battery life, inability to scan through songs (can only jump to the next track or start same song again), and lack of shock protection (smaller units use flash memory as opposed to a hard drive).  Also, the unit will only play WAV and MP3 format.In short, if you need a storage device for your MP3s that is portable enough to take in a car or elsewhere, but don't need an MP3 player to jog with, then this product will surely work well.  Prices for these units continues to decline, and I presume the newer units will solve many of the concerns of present units."
518,"The strap itself doesn't seem to fit a big wrist very well. I know it's supposed to be tight, but should be a little more comfortable. Other than that, it's a good quality. And I use it Frequently."
519,this was cheap in price and quality. sound quality was terrible but like i said they were cheap and i was not expecting much.
520,"As an electrical engineer, I feel that the product description for this item (Belkin F8E449 Universal AC Travel Adapter) is intentionally misleading.For example, it says:""Rated to handle both 110- and 220-240-volt standards... allows you to connect to international power outlets without a complicated power conversion""The statement above suggests that this 'AC Travel Adapter' is able to provide POWER conversion, so a potential customer may expect it to perform VOLTAGE conversion between 110/220V. But this is completely false, becasue this plug adapter is just a physical connection. It does not convert the VOLTAGE. It does not convert the CURRENT. In short, it does not perform ANY conversion at all.In the 'Technical Details' section it further says:""Allows you to charge your laptop, PDA, and cell phone internationally""A potential customer may be led to believe that: this product allows you to use 110V-only appliance in other countries.  The truth is, if you plug in an 110V-only appliance to a 220V socket through this 'adapter', your appliance wil blow up immediately.Power supplies for most portable electronics (laptop, camcorder, cell-phone, electric shavers, etc.) are already designed for universal voltage of 100-240V AC. Similarly, your travel iron or hair dryer could be ready for dual-voltage operation. Make sure to check your appliance's user manual, as it may require you to manually flip a voltage-selection switch before leaving for the trip.Of course, you still need a set of universal plug adapters for foreign countries - which is exactly what this product is meant to be."
521,"This cable works as advertised, connecting my printer to my computer. Be warned about the dirt though. A 10 foot cable will end up on the floor and attract a coating of dust and cat hair so that you WILL suffer gnarly yuck on your fingers when you reach for it.Is it too much to ask that Belkin ship these things with a layer of dust repellent installed?"
522,"I tried this for the first time at work. Inmediatly bought one. They are lightweight, excelent of running, great bass."
523,Feels a little cheap but works well. So I really can't complain. and it'll serve me well enough for the small stuff I do...and any hum in my recordings I gleefully work on removing in post.
524,"I purchased an GS108 v2 in 2006 as a backup, and just installed it this week.  I cannot get a connection on port 1, and the port 1 light flashes when nothing is plugged in!  The other ports seemed to work at first, but other network devices were failing as long as the GS108 was on the LAN.  Basically DOA, and now a year out of warranty.  Not quite the level of reliability I've experienced with other Netgear products."
525,"Best Sony product I have purchased lately. My 7 year old has Autism and we bought this for one of his CD sessions. It was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine, drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his CDs. I want to get a pair myself!"
526,"I had to send it back because for me it didn't work.  I thought it was my machine, but once I took the hub off I got rid of my problems."
527,Good quality and good price.  Very traditional design and sounds really good.  I am not sure how well it compares with those expensive silicon/molded in-the-ear designs.  But those cost quite a pretty penny.  So these ones are very good for the price range.
528,Very disappointed.  I bought these so that I could watch TV while my husband sleeps.  There is alot of popping noise in the audio.  I notice its worse when the video is bright.  I tried to move the base unit to different locations and still have the same problem.  I do not recommend for plasma TV's. Connected this to my daughters LCD and it worked fine.
529,"I have had these headphones for about 9 months now and I really LOVED them until last week.  Extremely comfortable, compact, and great sound.  Unfortunately, they recently started acting up.  My left headphone dropped it's volume level about 75%.  For all intents and purposes it's dead and it's driving me nuts listening to headphones with one side not working.  The interesting thing is when I started asking people I know who have them, I found that 4 of the 4 people I asked have had problems with them.  My friend who reccommended these headphones to me said after 6 months the bass dropped out entirely in one ear in his and he can no longer use them.  Today I got a call from my sister (who i bought a pair for as a gift because I loved mine so much) who said one of earplugs is entirely dead.  She's only had hers for about 6 months.  Another friend bought a pair and they were dead 3 DAYS after buying them!  Sony did replace his pair, but not without a LOT of hassles first.  They also tried to send a MUCH cheaper model to replace the original set.So my reccommendation is, These headphones are great when they work, but I paid $50 for mine, which I thought was worth the money until they broke.  But if I'm going to spend that much on headphones, I want them to last more than 6-9 months!Also... be weary of the silicone ear peices. They fall off easily and if you loose them, they are $5 each to replace.  Another absolute rip-off as i'm sure they cost about 2 cents to manufacture."
530,Did not work on my serial device.  Seemed to be in a loop.  The usb to serial I replaced it with works great
531,"I have used a pair of MDR-V600 headphones to fine-tune critical mixes and do any and all other client audio work for (I think) over a decade.  I have replaced the ear cushions once, which was surprisingly easy to do.  I cannot imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy -- these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work I do.  I have tried several other pairs of high-end cans and I keep coming back to these.  I think I paid twice what you can find them for now, back in the day (I seem to remember a $125 price tag), and seriously contemplate, every few months, shelving a second pair for safekeeping."
532,"The cable has exactly what I want in a USB cable. The mechanical connectors fit well, the cable itself is flexible. I haven't done any detailed diagnostics about the signal integrity, but I've  noticed no problems."
533,"On my Canon T3i Kit 55-250 lens, this polarizer works well. Make for awesome sky pictures with deep, rich colors. If you are looking for a cheaper polarizer, this is a good one to get.I took off a star because of how it works in screwing it on and off. If you don't pay attention, you can keep twisting the top piece of the polarizer and never actually screw it on or off. It's a two piece assembly that can twist on top but not turn the threads. It's not really a flaw, but is frustrating until you figure out how it's on there, and with big fingers it can be hard to get just right.I'd still buy it again though, I don't really ever take it off my telephoto lens."
534,"I like this lens.  It's very sharp.  My only complaint is the focusing on this lens tends to be slow at low light, just low light not dark.  The lens seems to search to much.  I had the tamron 60mm 2.0 which is incredibly sharp but it had the same problem.  I figured since the canon has USM that it would be faster at focusing even while hunting.  I also have the canon 100 - 400 which has USM and is incredibly fast at focusing.  It doesn't hunt as much as the 100mm but when it does it locks on much faster. I use a 7D with a Canon EFS 17-55 f2.8 which is incredibly fast focus and it hardly ever hunts so I don't think it is the camera.  Bear in mind I am not describing super dark situations just low light."
535,"Worked fine till I disconnected for the first time. I went to move cables after I had initially connected them. When I pulled out the video cable, the metal cap on center lead came off. I made the repair, soldering on a new RCA plug and now works fine again."
536,"Having owned 2 of these units for more than 2 years now, I am finally ready to review this.  My config link two of the same hubs.Pros:1.) Very cool looking hub.2.) No overheats, no matter how many devices of different types are doing transfers.  I have done as much as 5 usb thumbdrives  full transfers at once before.3.) Great for devices that doesn't require high speed: scanners, security dongle keys, controllers.4.) One very tough hub. In the past I have had hubs that occasionally act up with out of control lights etc.  This one is consistently in the same mood every day.5.) Very light.Cons:1.) When any usb 1.0 device is plugged into the hub, it runs everything at usb 1.0 speed.  Doesn't matter the order.2.) Even when 2 usb hubs are connected to one another, the speed of both hubs will drop as soon as something usb 1.0 is plugged in.  Doesn't matter which port on which hub.3.) Even when running at usb 2.0 speed, it cannot match regular usb 2.0 data transfer speed of you plugging a device directly into the motherboard ports.4.) For some reason western digital Mybook storage devices really struggle with this hub.  It maybe just my storage device?"
537,"Pros :Sound quality is good.Cheaper to buy.Cons :Highly uncomfortable on ears. After using it for 3 continuous days, my ears started aching.!"
538,"Good quality, but it was the wrong cable.. I needed female to male ends on the audio plugs.."
539,"This is a great product!  I researched for months and months, and finally decided to go with the 3900 series.  While, if I were to do it again, I'd get the 3975, just becuase it's bluetooth enabled, but it'll be another year or so before bluetooth is used widely enough to justify the extra hundred bucks.  No complaints with the iPAQ itself, execpt for the fact that I have a pixel out smack dab in the center of the screen.  Amazon wouldn't take it back--because I live in Japan, and after I had my visiting friend hand deliver it to me, I couldn't get it back to America in time for Amazon to feel they had an obligation to help me out--other than by referring me to the manufacturer.  So, I had it sent to a Compaq repair center and it was sent back to me with an explanation that my annoying pixel outage was within their accepted ""industry standard"" and they wouldn't repair it or replace my product.  What a bunch of hay!  What about my standards?  I bought their product brand new for around $$$, and they don't care that it's defective and really annoys me?  Bad customer service has likely cost Compaq a previously devoted customer."
540,"I've tried a LOT of headphones and earbuds over the years.  I returned four different pairs of various brands before I bought these Sonys.  They blow the competition at this price away, and lots of more expensive models as well.  I've had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition.  I use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably.  The balance and sound quality are exquisite, and I don't hand out compliments that easily."
541,"I'm a photography novice who chose this camera because I wanted: 1. a point and shoot that would make good shutter speed and F-stop decisions for me.  2. a single, high quality lens that telescopes and does wide angle, so I wouldn't have buy or change lenses.  3. excellent picture quality in prints and on screen. 4. an easy to use camera.  (I was quickly up to speed on most features after 1 read of the manual and a few experimental pictures.) 5. easy transfer of pictures to the computer.6. easy to use photo software that comes with the camera.The product excels in all these qualities except #5.  Also, I'm glad the battery's rechargeable, and that the lens cap is attached to the camera.I'm deducting the 5th star for 2 reasons:1.  I followed all the instructions in the manual for downloading my pictures and it didn't work.  I had to call customer service and be walked through an entirely different procedure not in the instructions.  Also, they recommended that I save pictures on my desktop so I won't lose them.  She told me other people have had the same downloading difficulty, but I don't know how widespread it is, or if it's been corrected.2.  I had to buy a couple extras to be completely satisfied with this camera:  (1) Extra battery because the one that comes with the camera only lasts about an hour.  (2) 64 Mb memory stick, because the 8 Mb memory that comes with the camera runs out very quickly.Bottom line:  Now that I've troubleshot the downloading problem and bought the extras, I'm very happy with this camera."
542,"I've had this on my Nikon 18-200mm for a few weeks now, and really like it. It truly brings out great colors in the photos. However, it's much darker than I would like for a polarizer. This, combined with the aperature of the 18-200, has resulted in some blurry photos for me (especially indoors when ambient light is crucial). That is mostly my fault for being too lazy to take it off, pero ni modo."
543,"It is very difficult to see any detail in this binoc. Very small view, very difficult to focus. I tryied to use them on a shooting range. I can only see more or less decent with one eye.I am buying Nikon."
544,"I used this camera to take images in a lab as a record of some work done on a steering mirror system. It's a cheap camera and the image quality reflects it. Matte surfaces had nasty artifacts, even at the 'upper medium' resolution and 'Superfine' quality.Although the camera is easy to handle and quite simple to use, the image quality is everything - and this is a piece of junk in that respect. Any of the Nikon Coolpix series are infinitely superior.Sorry, Canon. You should be able to do better than this."
545,"The USB hub is fine...it is a USB hub, so how great or bad can it be? It works with all of my devices and it's small...like every other USB hub I have ever bought.However, D-Link did not honor my rebate. Unlike the other poster who got a phone number to call, I only got a card in the mail with an address stating that I need to resubmit. I sent them a letter explaining that Amazon is not excluded on their form (some retailers are) and showing them a printout of the Amazon page with a link to the rebate form.It has been about 1 month since I did that and they have not replied. I am not keeping my hopes up about that $10."
546,"After I wrote my first review, and 10 days after I bought it, I accidentally dropped my Iomega hipzip onto a cement floor from a height of about five feet. It struck right where the purple lid opening contacts with the metal case. It rendered it useless. (It no longer registered when disks were in it and it emitted all sorts of whirring, clicking noises trying to find them.)I figured the warranty was as void as I could possibly get for such carelessness but I contacted Iomega anyway. Even after I told them (twice) that I had dropped it, they swung into action, faxed me out some forms, told me where to send my unit and oila... what looks eerily like a BRAND NEW replacement unit arrived on my doorstep just FIVE days later! (It certainly wasn't the same unit I sent them as it was missing an obvious scratch I had added.)Now that's after-sales customer support you can't beat anywhere.  For this alone I have to give the unit an extra star. Had I dropped any other brand, I'd be looking mournfully at a pile of expensive junk, with no recourse.NB: The unit was replaced through the south-east Asia/Australasia/Sydney branch of Iomega, but I am assuming that this company philosophy translates elsewhere. As customers, I think we should support companies like this which do the right thing -- and more -- for consumers, instead of always being solely after the almighty buck."
547,"These headphones are very uncomfortable and very crappy sounding.  They fall out of my ears in seconds, they are not adjustable, and the sideways speaker hurts my ears.  I regret buying these headphones; learn from my mistake."
548,"When I lived in Sweden, about 50% of the population had these headphones. They were extremely popular. Now I know why!The sound quality on these things is amazing, comparable to $50+ headphones. The only headphones I have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive Sennheiser headsets. The bass is really booming, and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrange.They are extremely portable too. I can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded up.Pretty durable cable too, and it doesn't twist.I highly recommend these!"
549,"Its a real good polarizer. Tiffen 55 mm circular polarizer fits well on my Tamron 90 mm Macro. It cuts the reflection very well and this is useful during macro photography. I would have loved to attach a ""multi-coated"" polarizer, but this does its job quite well."
550,"I recently purchased new laptop and wanted to give old laptop to aunt.Before I did, I wanted to upgrade the old Dell Inspiron 1525 Vista 32bit.I purchased an Intel processor and 4GB of memory.With the tools, that arrived in just a few days, I was able to slap in the new processor and the memory.Updated the OS to W7 and my aunt has been buzzing around with her &#34;new&#34; laptop.Tools were great for a novice like myself. I won't be a PC repair tech anytime soon, but at least I brought a smile to a family member with their 'fancy new laptop'."
551,"The most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera, but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices, including the HP Jordana, and even your laptop computer with a PC Card adapter.  You can store any type of data on the cartridge, and they can be quickly changed between devices.  I have never had a problem with any of my SanDisk Compact Flash Cards."
552,"I have owned this lens for about a month now. I opted for this one instead of the 18-55mm kit lens upon reading numerous reviews that it is a great general purpose lens for starters.I have to say I am impressed with Canon's USM system... and a relatively fast auto focus. I havent had a single time when the subjet was out of focus because of the len's mistake.It is pretty sharp around f5.6 all through the focal range.. mostly within 28-80mm range.To sum up:Pros:- A good general purpose Canon branded lens. 28-105mm is a decent focal range for starters.- USM is great.- AF is good.. mostly accurate.- Light weight, not bulky in size.- Decently sharp throughout most of the range.Cons:- Colors are not very bright or vibrant.. but a little post processing is all it needs.Final notes:The 28-105mm is great for its flexible range and the decent sharpness and USM... I have used it for everything from semi-macros to portraits to landscapes to long exposure shots at night to birds. And the build is professionally solid. Worth the money!!"
553,"Firstly. As mentioned in other reviews of similar IR products: DO NOT buy these if you have a plasma TV! I bought these for my apartment which has an LCD so I was not worried about it there, but I also tested them out first at my house which has a 42in plasma. The loud buzzing when the plasma TV displays bright screens makes the headphones unusable with that type of display.Secondly. Even when using with an LCD TV there is a buzzing/hissing/static sound constantly no matter where you are in relation to the reciever. I ended up unplugging all electronics in the entire room and the hissing was still there. I tried them out in several rooms on different recievers/TV's both in my apartment and house and the hissing never went away even when placing my head directly in front of the reciever within 1 ft.Thirdly. The ""vibration"" feature which is supposed to enhance bass'y effects is absolutely horrific. The motors which cause the vibration are so loud (even on the lowest setting) that it sounds like someone is pushing hair clippers against your ear.Lastly. The recharging cradle is very cumbersome and awkward. The headphones have to sit perfectly at the right angle for the charging unit to continue making contact.A charger should be easy to use and quick to set the headphones on and walk away, but this one forces you to spend time lining up the contacts perfectly and hoping it doesn't fall out while charging.Do not buy. Get some RF headphones or try out different models in a store if possible before getting IR headphones."
554,"I got this because I was getting shocked so hard and painfully by myHorizon Fitness T101-3 Treadmillthat the console would flicker. I bent a paper clip around the area near the heart monitor with pliers then clipped the alligator clip to the paper clip and since then I have never experienced another shock, so it is perfect in that regard. The only issue is that with all the sweat flying, it has gotten insanely rusty. I let the whole bracelet soak in WD40 for a few days and it seemed to remove some of the crunchiness, but it does still have some red/brown on it. A good idea might be to put a few drops of lube or WD40 BEFORE you ever use it, let it dry for a few days, then hopefully that will prevent or slow down rusting."
555,Just started exploring the camera. I love the light weight and the auto focus/flash that pops up when required.My only disappointment was that when I got the unit I didn't realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you time/date stamp your photos. If I had known about  that other model I would have ordered it.Bought this camera after  having used my sisters. Can be as simple or complex to use as needed.
556,The switch failed after only a few months of operation. I was using this switch to route video from IP cams in the house. Find a better product. This is the 2nd identical switch to fail. Not an isolated incident.
557,"I've been using Nikons for over 20 years, starting with my first used and battered Ftn. Over that time I've a accumulated a dozen Nikkor lenses and numerous accessories, as well as an assortment of bodies.One thing  that's been missing in recent years from the Nikon line is a reasonably  priced entry-level manual camera. The cheaper Nikons have tended to be  fully automated cameras, and the cheapest manual Nikon still being made  was, until recently, the FM2 at well over $500.If you work the way I do,  you need a manual camera  and don't have a lot of use for automation and  autofocusing. If you own an old Nikon and some old Nikkor lenses, you may  want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them. If you're a  student starting out, or an artist on a budget, you need a manual  camera.If you fit into any of these categories, the FM10 is a great  choice. It may not be as rugged as a $1200 F3 or a $2500 F5, but it's well  made and should last many years. I'm not a fan of zoom lenses for my own  work, but the included 35-70 is a good quality lens with a useful range,  and you can add more lenses if you need them.All in all, a good value  and a long-needed inexpensive entry into the Nikon system."
558,"This lens cover will never holds it's place on a canon glass , its always loose and doesn't lock , can never match the original cover that comes with the lens , don't waste your money ."
559,"The greatest shortcoming of the Canon Digital Rebel Camera is its built in, pop-up flash. The pop-up flash produces inadequate light and greatly underexposes many situations - and often is not spaced high enough from the camera body to avoid red-eye, lens hood or telephoto lens body shadow. I purchased the 420EX to improve on these situations.After a year of use - I LIKE my purchase of the 420EX.Things I enjoy with my 420EX:1. More powerful than the built in flash of the Digital Rebel2. Swivel/Bounce head offers great flexability for many different situations.3. Synchs perfectly to the Digital Rebel's exposure computer through the hot-shoe or hot shoe extender cord. Measures zoom level of standard zoom camera lens - and gives a good overall automatic exposure.4. Light enough to mount on an L/U aluminum bracket without throwing the camera out of balance. Use of a BGE-1 battery grip is highly recommended with a portrait photographers U bracket.5. Not a power hog. Can get up to 150-200 photos out of a set of four 2300 amp/hr Ni-Mh AA rechargables. (Always have a second set ready to go if on assignment - with a charger for the expended batteries.)6. Works well in slave mode. This is where it earns its money for me!7. Works well with a bounce light diffuser hood for portrait work.8. Height above lens eliminates most red-eye situations.9. GREAT VALUE for the money!10. Hot shoe mount eliminates all but the longest telephoto lens shadows.Things I 'd like to see improve:1. Not powerful enough. You can NEVER have enough light. The 580EX gains almost two full F-stops over the 420EX - though you pay a price almost double in cost.2. Battery door is flimsy - and sometimes fails to latch securely. (This is embarassing when you're shooting for a client and batteries are rolling all over the place - I know... I need to be more careful!!!)3. Tends toward underexposure in large or high ceilinged rooms. (You can never have enough light!)4. Lacks strobe, LCD display functions of the more expensive 580EX.A good solid product for most occasions. A great value for the money. Improves on the Digital Rebel's anemic pop-up flash. Eliminates most red-eye situations. Still not powerful enough for the discriminating photographer."
560,"I bought this a year and a half ago. Midway into using it the software program kept on freezing up and crashing. You would get a few songs on this thing, and then it would erase them while trying to add more.  It isn't drag and drop, making it impossible to add songs without this faulty program.Don't get an mp3 from a company that cannot provide good support. All their firmware, etc. for this product does not work.I had to buy a new player. this one was terrible!"
561,"Nice filter for the price, I would buy again."
562,"I accidentally switched the power brick between this (5V) and my D-Link router (7.5V) which ruined the USB hub and a keyboard/mouse connected to it.Why am I telling you this?  Because this device has no on board regulator, it passes whatever voltage comes from the brick directly on to your USB devices.  USB spec states that devices should be able to tolerate up to 20V, but as I have found first hand, that isn't always the case.A regulator that accepts a wide range of input voltages and outputs a steady 5V is extremely inexpensive and D-Link would have been wise to add that to this device to make it more robust."
563,"The 880 is a compact digital camera which produces excellent images. It does have its good and bad points:Good points:1. Nice body - resembles a standard camera - viewfinder is useful  except for macro when you have to use the LCD to aim. It grips and feels like a standard camera, which makes framing and squaring up an image easier for those trained on old film cameras.2. Easy to use - despite some claims, the instructions are clear, and for the most the settings seem intuitive. It is easy to move between the various preset exposure-speed settings. These are preferrable over the generic ""auto"" setting. The base ""auto"" mode makes too many compromises, and results in images which are just ""off"".Bad points:1. Missing some stuff. It comes with a small memory card, and without a rechargeable battery. Like nearly all digitals the Nikon inhales battery power. You MUST get a rechargeable battery, and a larger capacity Compact Flash memory card. Luckily the price seems to be falling on these. You should also get a card reader for your PC. Hooking up the camera to the PC is possible, but a card reader is far more convenient. No software included.2. The lens cap must be removed manually, and if you forget to do so, you'll get very angry and worrisome sounding whirling and grinding noises. Most basic point and shoot and APS cameras have a warning mechanism to prevent the recessed lens from deploying while the lens cap is on. The on/off switch is convenient, but at times too much so. It can be jostled and you'll reach into your bag to discover it in the ""on"" position with the battery sapped. A firmer switch with a ""snap"" would be an improvement.3. It is a bit pricey - I think that it would sell quite well, were it [...] cheaper...Still it is a nice camera with good technicial features, and capable of producing beautiful images."
564,These headphones sound very cheap and hollow. I would not recommend them. Build quality is ok and they fit decently but there are better headphones out there for this style.
565,"Terk provides a much neater situation using the Tower, but there is no enhanced reception for the money spent. The device was returned. A waste of money in my case"
566,"I produce digitally composed music. These are an absolute for anyone that makes computer music, just go ahead and add these quality, comfortable, crisp sounding headphones to your studio.No need to look around at other brands or cheaper/more expensive ones, these are the headphones you are looking for. Trust me.Check out my old tunes at  . Bunch of new songs droppin' in January. My soundcloud will improve now that I have these headphones."
567,"Have used similar products before, but this item wouldn't work at all for me.Now I'm typing more words because I didn't have enough to publish la la la."
568,I bought this to experiment with recording meetings using my laptop. This microphone didn't seem any better than the built in laptop mic.
569,We bought this for our Sansa Fuze and it won't play stereo and is very temperamental.  The plastic shielding around the end connection was also too big to insert into the music player.
570,"Worked well for almost 2 years, but then the power supply failed.  At first it was intermittent--I could get it to work by tapping it lightly.  Then I powered it down one day, and it wouldn't come back to life when I powered it up again."
571,"You can buy these nearly anywhere and I've used Hosa plenty of times in the past.  It does work and do the job, but the 'shell' around the male pin is spread a little to wide.  Needed to crimp it a bit to ensure a solid connection."
572,they mailed iot to me 22 Jan. and it finally arrived today 9Feb. and will not work is not compatable with windows 7 or above. I'ld send it back but the postage is more than I paid so I stuck with it....oh well....one of the very few things I ever got though Amazon that totally sucked. not  even worth a phone call  DON'T ORDER IT
573,I was going to buy the professional alternative of these headphones so before I did I read some of the reviews and there wasn't much of a difference I believe the only difference was the 1/4 plug is gold plated and this one isn't but these headphones are worth every penny. I use it for video editing and they rock hard.
574,"Sorry, but if you are looking for straight up headphones go get some jbuds.  The cord on these are way too long and I simply wasnt a fan of the product all around."
575,The headphones I ordered (Sony MDR-XB500) for my desktop PC and entertainment system had a too short cord. Now I can listen to music or movies from anywhere in my living room. The sound quality seems unaffected using these headphone extension cords. I'm satisfied with this purchase.
576,"Although this camera is cheap, it should be. Pictures require a great deal of light and then tend to be very contrasty... too bright in sun areas and too dark in shade. Movies are better than still pictures. It is easy to carry, but eats up batteries very fast. I use rechargeables but after 15 pictures and two 10 sec. movies, on a fresh set, I got a low battery warning. I have owned about 15 digital cameras over the past 15 years, and this is the worst by far. It is about the quality of most camera phones... if that good. The Oregon Scientific and the Logitech took much better pictures and took them in much lower light conditions. I bought the refub model for less than the price here and it came with all the extras.UPDATE: I have taken another two dozen pictures in good light and the pictures are better than the first batch. In fact, I compared them to those of my Kodak from 1999 with the same resolution but $200, and they are nearly identical, so I must conclude that cameras with this resolution take the same quality pictures, or nearly so, so it is really a four star for the price. Converting the pictures to black and white in Picassa 2 or other software produces very good b&w; pictures... surprisingly good."
577,"I heard that stock earbuds that come with any MP3 player suck, so I bought this thing.  Well, for $10, it's one of the cheapest earbuds you'll find out there.  The sound quality is pretty good, not great (duh, it's only $10).  Just because people give this high rating doesn't mean you should expect some great technology that will deliver everything.  It's good for the price.  When I lost these earbuds, I temporarily switched back to the stock earbuds.  I was SHOCKED, SHOCKED to find that the stock Sony MDR-E808 (which came with the Sony NW-E505) sounded better than these Sennheisers!  *Sigh* Now if only the stock earbuds weren't so short..."
578,"I bought this lens along with a couple of other Canon ""prosumer"" zooms several years ago when I switched from Nikon to Canon SLR's.  I hadn't used it much until I recently rediscovered how useful it is.See, I have the venerable 70-200/2.8L.  That lens is truly outstanding.  I use it a lot with the Canon EF 1.4X Extender which makes the 70-200 into a 98-280 f/4 zoom.  When I got the 70-200, I pretty much stopped using the 100-300.I recently realized that I carry the 70-200 around more than I actually use it.  My most used lenses are in the normal to wide range unless I have a special purpose in mind that requires a longer focal length lens.  But sometimes opprotunity presents the need for a long lens when you least expect it and, even though I was never a Boy Scout, I do like being prepared.  The 100-300 is smaller and lighter than the 70-200/2.8L.  It's a pretty sharp lens if you recognize its limitations.  Limitations include being a notch or two down in sharpness at the 300mm end of the zoom range unless you stop it down to around f/11.  At 200mm or shorter, it performs well even at maximum aperture even though it's not up to ""L-series"" optical quality.It's not ""L-series"" quality in build either.  It has a plastic barrel and the manual focusing ring was an afterthought.  It grows in physical size when zoomed to the longer focal lengths.  It sucks in dust by doing this (I have lots of speckles inside my lens to show this--but they have no affect on image quality).  It also has an annoying tendency to zoom itself back and forth by its own weight.  I carry a large rubber band around to keep this from happening if for some reason I use the lens on a tripod and tilt it up or down.I like this lens more today than I did when I first bought it, despite the fact that the 70-200/2.8 is a much better lens on all fronts."
579,"I got this because of the reviews saying they would stay in place...well, i tried them for the first time 2 days ago and I spent most of the time putting them back in place than actually working out (just running and walking, nothing too crazy).  They seem to be too big for me, not that my ears are tiny, but they definitely don't fit.Sound is just OK, you get what u paid for.  I don't mind too much about the sound quality, but if it would only stay in place!!"
580,I tried this in downtown Seattle where I ride my bike from the ferry up to pill hill.  It get's very poor reception until up on the hill.  I have a 10 year old analog GPX AM/FM receiver which works fine in the same area.  The headset ear buds hurt my ears so much I can only wear it for a 10 to 20 minutes.
581,quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.
582,Bought three of these. Works great but two of them is kind of loose when trying to turn. May be it is me.
583,"Everywhere you find quality reviews of these headphones (including audiophile sites), the V6 ranks highly.  They sound great for all kinds of music as well as for monitoring audio during video editing.  Probably not suited for audio mixing as these phones are made for great sound, not the sort of flat response you'd probably want for mixing.These phones sit on top of my ears, and as other reviewers have noted, they can get a bit warm and little too snug after a couple hours of wearing them.  However, I don't wear them too long in any one sitting, so it doesn't bother me."
584,The CPL is a basic filter  that should be in your kit it intensifies skies and reduce reflections on non-metallic surfaces.  Tiffen has a good reputation making filters.
585,"I have a amd athlon xp 2100, 8x agp capable motherboard, 400 watt power supply, 256mb ddr 300 ram.  I got enough to make this card run great, the only problem is the my card won't run at all..  I was able to play gta 3 once at ultra high resolutions, and it ran sooo sweet.  But that was only once.  I talked to ati, and they told me to do a few things, make it work better.  Nothing worked, so i sent it to them, they sent me a new one back.  Still didn't work, it would freeze constantly just trying to start a game in unreal tournament 2k3, max payne, nhl 2003, gta3, and the list goes on.  I am extremely dissappointed by the capability issues that it had.  I paid 350 bucks for this card, and i haven't been able to enjoy it yet(I've had it for 6 monthes).  I'm sticking to nvidia from now on.  Do research before you buy any card this price."
586,"I used two Celestron Omni 6mm's and one Meade 6.4mm eyepieces for comparison using my Celestron 70mm Travel Scope.  For looking at a star, there is a slight difference;  the Meade has a little less distortion - small spikes that radiate from the star as you closely focus.  BUT, when looking at terrestrial landscape, which I do a lot, the Meade has much less distortion (almost none) between the edges and the center.  The Meade has much better field of vision and slightly better eye relief.  These differences would show up when looking at the moon or sun (with filter).  Even though they are both Plossel eyepieces, there is a definite design / quality that makes the Meade a better eyepiece.  The difference in magnification is pretty much negligible."
587,Exactly as described on the ad. I bought this cable it with the AT&T 210 phone that is very poor quality to say the least. But the cable seems to work.
588,I just installed this print server on my home network.  Originally it worked on my Linux and Windows 7 systems.  Now it works on neither.  It reports the printer is off-line all the time.  When it was printing it was very slow.  I have updated the firmware to the latest.  The only driver available is several years old and will not even install on my Windows 7 machine.
589,"I wear glasses. sometime when I clean my glasses it cannot clean very well.I see this item then I think my help, but actually the hair of brush start falling down and when I use the other brush it make everything dirty.this was try before I clean my brother digital camera, and it is good I make this try."
590,"It sounds great for classical music, acoustic instruments, etc... but is rather weak on the bass for hip-hop and pop music.  Even the standard earbuds that came with my Muvo have more bass.However, it is Sennheiser, overall quality is great, and it does come with a 2 year warranty, which is better than my Muvo earbuds which broke within a few weeks of getting them.The cord is only a meter long and a bit on the short side.  The on-cord volume control is handy, and the blue color is nice.But for $15, it's a good deal.  But it could be better."
591,A+++++++
592,"I did not know that Sony made headphones of this quality, and give this pair highest possible recommendation.Whenever you see words like ""professional quality"" or ""pro ""  or ""studio monitors"" in the product description, run in the other direction. 99% of the time, this is simply exaggeration by an ad copyist who has never been in a recording studio. The V6 is a happy exception, and certainly worth the price of admission.MONITORS?A genuine one must allow you to hear every last detail of the sound/voice/music:--the sound of the reverb of the radio studio--whether or not the announcer is using a pop and/or wind filter--how far from the mike the announcer's mouth is--what brand of mike is being used (for music, Neumann U87 or AKG have a distinctive sound)--mike placement in relation to a large chorus and/or symphony orchestra--acoustics/reverb-time of the performance venue--be able to hear individual tracks in a multi-track overdubYes, YesThere are not many headphones that meet these requirements, but the V6 certainly qualifies with flying colors, regardless of the cost. My old standard, AKG K340 Electrostatic/Dynamic, has long since given up the ghost, but these are a more than adequate substitution (besides, the K340 was a wee bit bright, but the V6 is much more flat).This is both good and bad: really good recordings will sound even better, but bad recordings will sound even worse.ERGONOMICSThe plug is solid aluminum rather than black plastic, but is straight rather than bent.The cord is long, and half of it is coiled, so you get plenty of running room, but is no good for on-the-go uses.Despite the conventional design, it is one of the lightest and most comfortable I have ever used. Many hours of non-stop usage is not unreasonable for this pair.The pads are large and surround your entire ear but are certainly not isolating. They are rather soft, and the material will wear out with time, so expect to replace them at some point (and the replacement pads ain't cheap)."
593,"I've had two Western Digital Caviar Harddrives and so far both of them have completely died. Both suffered from problems with the heads and made a loud clicking sound before they died and lost most of their data. I got them about 4 months apart, and they both died a little over a year after I had purchased them. The warranty on these drives only lasts 1 year so I was out of luck and couldnt RMA. In fact, for both cases I was just a month or two out of warranty.In my experience, the best types of drives are made by Seagate, IBM and Hitachi (who basically makes the same drives as IBM). I also have one Maxtor drive which is still running fine and one really old dead Maxtor drive. I've never had any problem with Hitachi drives, except once, but it had arrived DOA when I bought it and the online merchant shipped me a refurbished drive instead of a new one (the bastard). From now on, I will stick only with brands that have 3 year warranties so I dont have to buy 2 brand new replacement hard drives within a 3 month period like I did after the Western Digital drives died. They worked fine for about a year then just crapped out."
594,"On the good side, the sleeve material is sturdy. It is easy to slide the label into its pocket in the tab on top of the sleeve... you don't need a black plastic insertion tool like you do with other brands. On the bad side, the fit is just too snug. The CD or DVD will never fall out, but it takes some force to get it in and out. The booklet doesn't fit flat unless you trim about an eighth of an inch off the right side of it. The pictures in the listing make it look like the CD fits loosely and the booklet fits fine... not so. I have upload some photos that I took to show you that the fit is too snug."
595,"These cases are ok if they're not broken during shipment.  The manufacturer wraps the product in bubble wrap, which doesn't protect the cases on either end of the package from being destroyed - in my case two deep.  Unfortunately, Amazon's packaging doesn't take this into account.  My shipment had 6% of the cases destroyed during shipment.  I've never had this happen with the black cases, which I also buy."
596,"I wanted pretty design and a coiled cord, so I took a risk with Koss. Maybe I got a defective pair, but the sound was poor, flat with almost no bass. Some reviewers say you need an extra amp for these, but my 100 watt-per-channel amplifier says ""I don't think so"", and overall volume was very high, just the bass was missing. My old $25 Sennheiser sounds much better. Returned next day, won't try Koss again."
597,"After 5 out of 6 burns resulted in errors, I thought that something might be amiss. Sure enough, there was: these discs are worthless. I've never seen anything like this really, especially from a well known electronics company like Sony. Steer way clear."
598,"I always order these. They seem to last longer for me than they do for other people. Maybe it's in the care, I don't know. I keep using these and they never fail me."
599,"I misread the listing. I was thinking it said it was a 128 gb card, and I read more than once to be certain I was reading it right and still misread it. I was needing a bigger SD card than 128 mob so I can't really give a good review."
600,"I took my trusty old Sennheisers with me when I tried out these in a shop, and guess what? No contest: Sennheiser DESTROYS Bose in a nanosecond!  Much more natural sound, none of the exaggerated highs, boomy lows and empty mids...thank God I tried before buying!Granted, the Bose sound better than my $20 Sonys I use for jogging, but you can get the Sennheisers for less money to enjoy much better sound."
601,"i may be doing something wrong but the dock won`t send pics to my pc.i still have to plug into the camera.it does keep my batteries charged,so i guess it`s worth the price."
602,"The device is good at relieving wrist strain.  Unfortunately, the fancytwo-way button (left button and right button combined) has startedmalfunctioning after only 10 days.  This has been reported by otherreviewers.I wish they'd quit trying to makeit fancy and just put in good old-fashioned buttons, which areeasily available, cheap, and reliable."
603,"I have a LCD tv and a LCD pc monitor that I connect my laptop to on a regular basis. I needed a basic vga cable and this gets the job done. The cable is relatively thick, but isn't an issue for me."
604,"With just a little more common sense and effort, this radio could have been great. However, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The first thing you notice is that the whip antenna is not securely attached to the radio and moves around loosely within the plastic radio housing. When the antenna is fully extended, this translates to a 4 to 6 inch left-right thrashing. The digital display is invisible when looking down on the radio from above. This would be for example when the radio is on a table or night stand and you are in the seated position. The radio must be tilted back or you must look at the display from below for the digits to appear. The radio has a multitude of slide switches which are notorious for going open or intermittent. But the main disappointment is the tuning scheme used in the SSB mode. To hit the correct beat note, there is a thumb wheel on the side of the radio that provides a frequency offset. The problem is that the adjustment or rotation range is about plus and minus 5 KHz which is very course. This makes fine adjustment of the LSB or USB pitch very difficult. The range of the thumb wheel should have been plus or minus 1 KHz rather than 5 KHz. All in all, the radio is just awkward to use. You wouldn't want it on your night stand in the dark as the dial light is very dim and useless. Put your money into something with better engineering such as the AOR."
605,"worked,doen't sound too good though,don't know why,but it doesn't what it supposed to do,i'm not doing a cartwheel over it"
606,I like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordable.
607,"I got these as the second warranty replacement for my discontinued Koss A130.Koss initially sent me the Pro4AAT.  They were terrible.On the other hand, the PRO4AA sound almost as good as I remember my father's sounded.Good clarity (could be better), good dynamic range, good imaging, good basses, good midrange, good highs.Build quality leaves lots to be desired, they look cheaply made, the foams under the ear cushions are in different places from one side to the other.  The piece that has the hinge pivots is poorly molded, and it is almost cutting sharp.Koss sent them, as I said before, as warranty replacement.  They were in a box that badly deformed the head band.  After reshaping the the head band, they fit comfortably with just the right amount of pressure on my head/ears.  Even though they are on the heavy side, I can listen comfortably for hours.I would recommend them to my friends with a warning about the build quality."
608,"These earclips fit nicely around the ears and perform that function well.  However, to play any rock music, or music with bass, soft or low sounds through these headphones is a crime against humanity.  I purchased these at a brick and mortar store and the moment I played one title from Godsmack through them I knew they had to be returned.  The bass is is almos non-existent and soft sounds can not be discerned.  The OEM headphones that came with a Creative Zen V Plus far outshine this model."
609,The cable causes crackles when being moved around. I should've expected this for something so cheap. It works though =).
610,"I purchased this camera almost 2 years ago. 6 months ago, it displayed the first occurence of the E18 error (problem in the lens mechanism), but recovered. It did that again last week and could not recover. Both times, it happened when I was on vacation. Search the web for E18 and you'll know what I mean. So, now I have a useless paperweight not worth spending money to get repaired. Now I will go for another canon, but an older model with a digital-only zoom, for 2 reasons a) the optical zoom on the A60 has give me enough grief, b)to keep using my 2 CF cards, since the latest cameras do not accept CF cards."
611,"I bought this radio a few years ago. I never liked it. I used it very little due to its poor reception and poor controls. I recently sold it pratically brand new for $100. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. This radio is not what others claims to be. It has very poor reception on all bands. The display window is tiny. The light is dim and cheap looking. The design and technology on this item is not good.  If you want the very best you can get, buy the Sangean 909X. Check out my review on the Sangean. I recently posted it on Amazon. If you find the Sangean too expensive, anything from CCradio is good too. Forget about this one. Sure, it is Made in Japan, but not even that can save it! You've been warned!"
612,"With Sony you usually get no more than what you pay for.  These headphones don't cost much and they aren't worth much, either.  Overall flimsy plastic construction, not sensitive (loud) enough, so-so frequency response.  I paid about the same price for a set of JVC headphones that are much better in every way."
613,"I bought this along with my Kodak DX4330 camera thinking it would be really nice and convenient.Well, it IS nice and convenient - easy to set up and works well. One touch and it sends the pictures to the computer. The charger works fine too - I think the problems others may have are more related to the battery than the charger. But here are the drawbacks of this product:1) Too expensive - I later discovered there are cheaper battery chargers (by Kodak as well). They don't transfer images to the computer like the dock does, but I don't think that's a big deal after all. Do a search for 'battery charger' ...and you'll find quite a few good alternatives to this camera dock.2) They should have had a way to turn off the charger. Right now, when I'm done charging the batteries in the camera, I remove the camera since the 3 lights just stay on forever. I know that the batteries will not get damaged from overcharging, but those 3 lights staying on forever eventually seems wasteful! Since there's no switch to turn off the charger, you have to remove the camera if you don't want the lights to stay on forever. Kinda defeats the purpose of having a dock in the first place where you'd like to just leave your camera in it till you need to take pictures again.So overall, it works as intended to transfer the images from the camera to the PC, and it charges the batteries fine. But it could do with improvements AND it really needs to get [less expensive]!"
614,"I liked these for the most part, but the plastic is cheap and they broke pretty quick because of that.  The sound still works, but the headphones had to be taped back together.  Good for cheap headphones, but lacking true quality craftsmanship."
615,"I've just bought and received this item from amazon (August 25, 2008) and the quality is much lower from what i would expect on a $90 USD Keyboard.I'm having problems with the touchpad on this keyboard that i never had with laptop touchpads, like the mouse pointer moving randomly through the screen just before i click on something or at the edges of the touchpad, even with the latest drivers from Lenovo or Synaptics.The trackpoint buttons below the spacebar do not always work and sometimes i have to click them very hard or multiple times for them to work.The Page Down, End and Backspace Keys also suffer this problem, they have a different feel than the rest of the keys and sometimes i have to press them very hard or multiple times to make them work.Also the location of the Fn key is very annoying if you're are used to the Ctrl key being in the lower left corner of the keyboard and there is no way to remap it or swap it with the Ctrl key.Overall it feels like a cheaply made keyboard.On the plus side i can type 10 wpm faster on this keyboard than on a regular desktop keyboard. Also, if you want regular Home, End, Insert, Delete, PgUp and PgDn key locations you can rearrange and remap the keys on the Numeric Pad to match the location on a standard keyboard."
616,we have a couple of these in the house and its a good product. Hooks up to the canon printer easy. I guess it can be used for alot of other things.
617,"I thought I'd give the iTrip a try, in lieu of installing a CD player in my 1990 BMW 525i.The unit is small, light and cute, and installs easily (a quick software install and then just pop it on top of your iPod). It worked okay with a radio here in the office, but even turning the unit slightly away from the radio would introduce static.So out to the car we go. The unit sits on the center console less than six inches away from the radio -- and the signal is okay until you start moving. Then with every turn, even though the unit doesn't move, there's static.The sound quality is poor, and the signal pickup is so narrow and weak that if you are in any kind of urban area where there are stations all along the dial, you're going to be SOL with this baby. Even though we have plenty of open air here, this was the case for me regardless of how low in the band I went, and how I fiddled with the sound level, position of the unit, etc.It's going back, unfortunately.  :-("
618,"I bought this on a whim, since I already had a Netgear 624 that was fine.  The 614 would sometimes fail to connect devices/computers/printers, sometimes would show a 'low signal' at the device side, and would seldom recognize my HP wireless printer, so I moved everything back to my Netgear 624 which worked calmly and well.  I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty.  I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc.  My advice is:  don't buy the 614, even if they give it away eventually.  I don't know which wireless router to suggest since I'm only used the 624 and the 614.  BEfore this I was wired with a Linksys that performed fine and stable for years and years.  I don't know today who makes a solid wireless router.  I suspect only one or two of them out there are truly solid and reliable."
619,"I listened through my Sennheiser HD280 pro headphones with and without the 10' Hosa extension cable and could not notice any degradation of signal or difference in tone. So, the cable is certainly satisfactory in that respect. At its Amazon price I have to say that it's reasonably priced, as well. As for its quality of construction, it appears comparable to inexpensive cables in general.  I'll also say that I've purchased other Hosa products and have been satisfied with them.  I don't know how well it would stand up to abuse, but the answer to any question along that line is simple: don't abuse your cables and they'll last a lot longer and provide better service.  I'll close by reminding readers that the flow of electricity through cables is governed by the laws of physics, not the marketing departments of the high-end cable manufacturers that charge five or ten times as much for products that do the same thing (i.e., carry a signal from point A to point B).  I hope this is helpful."
620,This cable is just ok for the money the molded end is not sturdy at all and after a few days it began to buzz.  I had to tape the cable backwards to keep it working.
621,"I bought the lens and inside the lens is waste , I can not believe Amazon sells second selection things ..... WARNING !!!!!!"
622,"The Cruzer works on one of my laptops running XP, and used to work on my other laptop when it ran Windows 98 (2nd Edition). But when I upgraded the second laptop to XP, the Cruzer stopped working with it. The computer simply does not recognize the presence of the device. The Sandisk Web site contains no useful information about this problem and is pretty inadequate in general. Too bad, because the product, when it works, is quite good and can be a convenient alternative to Zip disks."
623,"I was looking for some Beats by Dre headphones, but I did not have enough money to cash out $300 for some. I ended up buying the MDR-V6's for about $80. They are worth every single penny, and I think they sound better than the Beats.I like to listen a lot of rock, alternative, hip-hop and electronic. John Mayer, Justin Nozuka, Santana sound so good through these headphones. If you like listening to mainstream hip-hop, the bass in these headphones will go down low without distortion. Listening to Daft Punk and Justice through these headphones made me love them even more.If you love listening to an array of music genres, your ears definitely be satisfied for a lifetime with these headphones.I also use these headphones as studio monitors when I record my own music."
624,"The product works as advertised.  If you have large wrist, you will have problems to get on.  I have average wrist and it worked fine...but just barely.  The price for value is appropriate."
625,Convenient and easy to use - allows you to carry on a conversation and still listen in on conference calls.
626,"As noted above this device stops working and requires a reset. Many times during the day it seems to ""fall asleep"" and does not respond for a few seconds."
627,I like it. It works. I put together 2 computers using it and worked on one other with it on without any electrostatic discharge!
628,"The day care lady said the bottles needed to be labeled, and I balked at shelling out $60 for fancy on-line labels.  A little hunting around lead me to this tape.  I made up a bunch of labels and stuck them to the bottles, and they've stayed stuck going on three months now.  During that time they're regularly immersed in water for hours at a time and spend a couple minutes each day in a steam sterilizer (they do not, though, go through the dishwasher).  During this time they have by and large held fast.  A couple corners on 2 (out of 12 pieces) have pulled up a tiny bit, but by and large everything is sticking tight.One thing though: this tape does not have the ""crack back"" feature.  You have to peel off the backing the slow, hard way, and I got so frustrated I nearly threw the whole thing in the trash.  My wife was able to get the backing off, though.Overall this is a great way to save a few bucks for this particular application.__________________________________________________________________I just want to add that since the review was written we have been sending the bottles and lids through the dishwasher and the tape has held up astoundingly well.  NONE of the labels have pulled off, and the couple corners that have pulled up a tiny bit have not pulled up anymore.  These labels have been through the dishwasher over 100 times and they're still sticking fantastically.  This tape is a great product."
629,"When one buys an TV these days; especially LCD or Plasma you open the box and find a giant DO NOT USE column in the manual telling you how virtually everything out there is bad for your TV.  In a way this is true but also misleading.  There are tons of products out there that are designed for cleaning the screen of your awesome TV but Monster personally gives you the best kit for the price.  While you are paying a bit of a premium since it is ""Monster"" brand it is worth it in the end; but beware this kit has a MONSTER bite in it...I will break this review down into  3 simple parts... The cleaning solution, the Cloth and review of how well they work together.** CLEANING SOLUTIONThe misconception when it comes to cleaning your TV (especially plasma and LCD) is that you can only use cleaning kits.  This is not true.  The main ingredient of virtually all Screen Cleaning kits is nothing more than De-Ionized Water.  With the monster solution, even though it is in small print, the bottle contains mainly De-Ionized water with some ""proprietary"" polymers.  The kit that I purchased came with a 6.76 Fl Oz. bottle of solution, which is more than enough to last about 2 years doing cleanings once every other week.  The bottle itself is constructed well with a durable spray cap and cover.  The solution has a cloudiness to it probably due to the added polymers.** MICRO-FIBER CLOTH (Included)Mine came with a 12in x 12in ( 1.0 sq ft ) cleaning cloth that is double sided.  This cloth is one of the better micro-fiber cloth I have ever owned, and is light-years superior to those free mini-cloths you might get with an LCD monitor or TV.  Because the cloth is double sided it can serve as both a wet and dry side at the same time which makes for a very easy cleaning job.  There was a lot of detail put into the cloth as even the Monster trademark tag on it is made from a non-scratch fiber so there is no worry if it rubs up against the panel.  The cloth is very durable and will hold up exceptionally well over multiple cleanings.** CLEANING YOUR TVWhen it comes to cleaning your TV with this product this is where I feel the product fails in the end.  Despite saying it is streak free it is far from it.  I attribute this to the ""proprietary"" polymer in the solution.  When using just straight de-ionized water no streaks; however this product will streak if not cleaned correctly.  You have to treat this product as if you were applying WAX on the surface of a car to get the maximum effect.  Below is what I tend to do and it never leaves streaks1. Pick one side of the cloth and spray a section with solution until moist2. Using that moist section slowly clean in nice gentle circles around your TV like you would if you were applying wax to a car.  Do this to cover the entire screen and apply more solution to the cloth if needed3. When fully cleaned flip the cloth to the DRY side and using the dry side, repeat the buffing motion around the TV to essentially dry and buff the screen.  It should now be streak free and good as new.Prior to doing this I simply followed the on-bottle directions (which simply tells you to wet the cloth and rub it around the screen ; repeat as needed).  When finished if you looked at the TV just right you saw streaking which I confirmed by shutting the lights off in the room and shining an LED flashlight on the TV.  The entire screen was just blobs of streaks where solution had been slightly saturated.** OVERALL: The product as a team is a great price.  You get a high quality cleaning cloth and a good sized bottle of solution(even if it is mostly de-ionized water).  While the product does work as intended I feel that it perhaps tries to hard to be unique with its cleaning solution.  Sometimes less is better especially with cleaning compounds and solutions.  Overall I would give the product 3 stars simply because the included directions on the bottle leave you with streaks and.  So in the end; the Monster TV cleaning-kit gets the job done but not exactly as advertised.NOTE: Avoid using any cleaning solution that contains standard Water or Alcohol / Ammonia in it.  Water simply because it isn't exactly healthy to toss water onto an LCD panel since there is no protective shield (can eventually cause electrical problems).  Alcohol / Ammonia have actually been known to eat away at the LCD screen over time.  While you won't see the effect immediately, over time with repeated cleanings using Alcohol / Ammonia you will see color fading in certain spots or even dead pixels / sub-pixels starting to show up.  This is because Alcohol based products eventually dry the plastic up which then cracks thus killing your screen (Old LCD's were glass but current generation LCD's use a plastic polymer and glass blend) The Alcohol dries up the plastic portion of the screen thus eventually ruining it.NOTE: Cleaning cloths do not last forever.  Eventually the dirt and dust they collect starts to work against you (scratch the screen).  While you can wash the cloths, it really isn't recommended.  As long as you take good care of your cleaning cloth, and don't spill anything crazy on the TV screen, the cloth should last you quite a few years."
630,"As far as I can tell this only works with windows and it doesnt have much support documentation.  I bought one to be able to run to my PS3 and I couldn't ever get it to work.  I am no genius, but I consider myself pretty technical, and this was just not straightforward.  Linksys, you can do better than this!"
631,"I was agonizing between this lens and the Canon EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM.  Basically, the reviews and specifications are similar.  The 100 mm lens is EF while the 60 mm lens is EF-S, so the 100 mm lens is compatible with full frame cameras.  However, most people willing to invest in a full frame camera are probably considering the 100 mm L lens.  My thoughts on comparing the two lenses:1.) Price is similar, with the 60 mm being $100 less only2.) 60 mm lens weighs half as much3.) Both get 5/5 stars with around 100 reviews on Amazon4.) Magnification is the same on both (1:1)5.) You can stay a bit further from your subject with the 100 mm lens at max magnification, 1 ft rather than 8 inchesAnyway, I was unable to decide between the two, and I saw that the 100 mm lens was available from Amazon.  I decided to test-drive it and keep it if I was happy.  My thoughts:1.) The lens didn't seem that extraordinary on my camera, but I was extremely pleased with the results once I looked at them on a big screen.  It's sharp and the colors are beautiful.2.) I thought I'd rather have a 100 mm lens than a 60 mm lens since I already have a 50 mm lens.  However, I think 100 mm is a rather awkward focal length on the non-full frame camera.  It's not long enough to take much in the way of animals and birds, but it's often too long to take pictures of pets or people you're with.  For things in macro, it doesn't make much difference since you're going to be so close to the subject either way.3.) The lens felt very heavy on the camera given that it's a fixed lensFor me, the main argument for the 100 mm over the 60 mm was that I had a 50 mm lens already, and I thought it would be great to have another fixed lens at a different focal length.  The main argument for the 60 mm lens was the weight.  After using the lens, I think the 60 mm is probably a better choice for non-full frame users."
632,"This router provided ok wireless at my grandparents house when it worked, then one day the power went out.  When the power came back on no internet connection, computer and printer showed no network connecting at all.  When I looked at the router every light but the power was out.  Tried resetting it, no luck.  Total life was just over 2 years."
633,Hardly anything works on this radio. The shortwave doesn't work and the AM/FMbarely works.I don't see how anybody can sell this radio.
634,"Too much drag on the roller.  The scroll ring movement feels like a partially failed ratchet.  Button action is acceptable.  The older model with mechanical rollers was much better.  Less expensive, too."
635,"First bought these back in 1995 along with a Sony diskman with my first paycheck. These headphones have been used along with my Sony Diskman, iPods (gen 1, 3 and 6), home stereo and gaming pc's since I got them. It has outlived most of the tech I had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them. Bought a replacement pair in 2009 on Amazon and just got around to reviewing them.These headphones sound great when I first bought them and still do now. They opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones don't pick up.I have taken these with me while riding the bus, long car trips and on the airplane. They can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag. So they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in. They are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time. Even taken long naps and slept with them over night. They do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones. They are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a vice.Only problem I ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while. But you can get replacement pads that don't flake. But I cant knock the rating down for that since I had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back in."
636,"Mine recently broke apart, but they lasted a really long time and sounded great! I need to find the latest model of these and buy them again."
637,"I'm getting a bit of ghosting on text that makes it unpleasant to read. My eyesight is poor enough that if I'm sitting back from the screen and watching a movie in HD it doesn't seem too bad, but I'm not happy with the ghosting....."
638,"Not much you can say about a USB cable.  It's sturdy and of pretty good quality.  It works, that's what counts."
639,"Granted, I have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for Christmas, but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player.  First, the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds.  When I hit &quot;menu&quot; it told me, &quot;playback only.&quot;  I actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu.  This is extemely lame.  The remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use.  In addition, it only seems to work if you're about five feet away from the player, although that may have been just the batteries that came with it.  The player does seem to play dvds adequately enough.  It also has an optical out, which it should.  I think for about $40 more, you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though."
640,"This HOSA cable is exactly what I needed: to allow me to listen to my i-pod touch through a medium quality A/V receiver and speakers. The sound quality ""does not appear to be"" nowhere near my other system consisting of a much higher quality A/V receiver and speakers. Of course the reason is the difference in the components, including the HOSA cable. To make the comparison even more difficult, the two surround sound systems are at different locations. So, I can't make an A-B comparison. I am satisfied with this purchase as it cost me 15% of the Monster Cable I use in the other system. I plan to install the HOSA cable in my better set-up to make a valid A-B comparison and establish once-and-for-all whether money I spent on the expensive cable was worth it. So, the 3* rating I gave above is subject to the qualifications described here."
641,"I bought this flash as an upgrade for my (now almost ancient) Powershot G2.  I had originally liked the idea the G2 had a ""hot shoe"" and would someday take an external flash.I waited too long!  The difference is night and day on the quality of any picture, inside or outside, shot with the flash.  It easily mated with the G2, and the bounce adjustment creates really nice effects with light on indoor shots.  Lighting is much more natural, and the distance that the flash will light is a big improvement.  Personally I believe the bounce option makes this a better choice than the 200 series canon flash.There is simply no comparison with using the built in flash.I highly recommend this flash for anyone with a decent digital camera that can take an external flash - you'll be very happy with the improvements."
642,"The Coolpix functioned well until about 10 months into ownership, when the lens mechanism failed and the display shows only a ""System Error"" message.  I suspect that because the unit designs to force the lens against the lens cap, some damage occurs through frequent use if you fail to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on.  This is a definite design defect.  Although I loved the camera for 10 months, and frequently used it instead of my Canon EOS 10D, this design defect basically sinks this unit as defective from the get-go.  Avoid.However, in this edit of my review, I was able to fix the problem later by continuing to cycle the camera through a lens opening and closing and by forcing the retraction of the lense.  (I know it is hard to explain.)  Finally, the software matched the machinery and the system error vanished.  What a hassle, but it saved sending the camera back."
643,It is hard to believe the SRP as this is not a super thin filter (which allows multiple filters without getting into the field of view) but it is an excellent coated polarizing filter with smooth circular action.
644,"I had my doubts about &#34;BIC&#34; from the beginning!Still, against my better judgement, I ordered this POS anyway.If I could get away with it, I wouldn't give this garbage a single star.This cheap brick blew less than 5-minutes after plugging it in.I got a refund and placed it toward a Cerwin Vega XLS-6C.After all, I need a Center Speaker that actually works. And like everyone else I want crisp dialogue.More importantly for me, I also wanted as much inherent Bass as possible, in order to fully round out the effects of my Sony subwoofer and front speakers. The CV supposedly provides all that and more, but I'll have to wait and see for myself. As for everyone else concerned, stay away from this no-name junk!"
645,"I had this item for about three days when it broke. My computer was brand new also. I knew I had everything hooked up right. Finally, I had to pay a technician to come out because I thought there was something wrong with my computer. I sent the router back for a refund. The technician sold me another NetGear router and it's been working fine. Maybe I just got a bad one. I hope so but it cost me a lot of money to find out."
646,"I bought a pair of headphones from another company for ... way more money.  I stumbled on these as I didn't want to leave such expensive headphones in my desk at work.  Turns out, I never should have bought the more expensive pair.  I'm sure there are better ones on the market, but for my ears these are more than enough."
647,it's about what I was looking for. and it works for what i was needing it to do the jobs I had.
648,"In my home I am fortunate to have both a wired and wireless network installation.  I recently completed the upgrade of the wired portion from 10 Megabyte per second (Mps) to 100Mps; a total of two servers and one workstation.  The cost of PCI 10/100 Network Interface Cards (NIC) have come down in price to such a degree that not switching would have been in my opinion silly.But converting my wireless network to 100Mps was impossible since such high throughput is as yet unrealized in the wireless arena, however it is coming.  D-Link and several other manufactures now offer 54Mps (the 802.11g standard), but at a cost I am not willing to pay, yet.  However, D-Link also offers a 22Mps solution, in both Wireless Access Point (WAP), PC Card, and NIC.Moving my wireless network segment to 22Mps meant an investment in an all new WAP since the current WAP was capable of only 11Mps.  D-Link has been on the forefront of home wireless technology for the last few years and offers a suite of products to suit my modest needs.  So, I watched and waited for a good sale, and when one happened my way late last year, I purchased the 22Mps D-Link DWL 900 AP Wireless Access Point.And the complement the DWL 900 I purchased two ""D-Link DWL 520+ Wireless PCI NIC"" Adapter cards. The DWL 520+ operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, and supports the following wireless standards:  IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.11b, and can transmit and receive traffic at the following data rates: 22Mbps 11Mbps, 5.5Mbps, 2Mbps, and 1Mbps.Not Ready for Windows XPDespite D-Link's claim these cards will not work with Windows XP out of the box.  Both my primary workstation and that of my spouse run Windows XP Home.  Both PC's also have Linksys WPC11 Wireless NIC's installed, and running flawlessly, but the cards are limited to 11Mbs throughput.Hoping the installation of the ""D-Link DWL 520+"" would be painless (who was I kidding?); I installed the first card in my workstation.  True to form, Windows XP detected the new card and then prompted me for the software which I eagerly fed it.  But then a funny thing happened on the way to 22Mps wireless heaven: nothing.  The card didn't work.  Not only did it not detect the WAP scant 20 feet away, but it also locked up my computer.  So I rebooted: same result lock up.  Puzzled, I restarted Windows XP in Safe Mode, same result: lock up.  I then removed the card, and booted into the ""Last Known Good Hardware Configuration,"" but Windows XP refused to play.  End result: Operating System (OS) reload!  Needless to say I was not amused.Thinking this might be an aberration (or that I might have a defective card), because after all I experiment with my workstation constantly, I attempted to install the second card in my spouse's computer: same result, sans OS reload, thank God.  I called D-Link technical support; not luck.  In fact I knew more about the cards then they did!On a whim, I installed the first card in a spare Windows 2000 Server box, result: the card worked!  I then installed it into a Windows 98 computer, result: the card worked again. Needless to say, in frustration I shipped the cards back to Amazon.com and got a full refund.  And now I am back to where I started; 11Mps.ConclusionThe ""D-Link DWL 520+"" while the perfect mate for Windows 9x and Windows 2000 computers, does not work with Windows XP, so you are now forewarned.  Since Windows XP was able to detect the physical card, I have come to the conclusion that the drivers are to blame.  Since my experience with the ""D-Link DWL 520+"" the company to my knowledge has not updated the drivers, but certainly cannot be ignorant of the problem.  Bottom line, if you run Windows XP, this is not the card for you."
649,"I am dissappointed with this product.  I live roughly 30 miles from a DC, but only 20 miles from a radio tower.  This antenna is not strong enough to pick up FM stations.  I am able to pick up stations, but they all have static.  It doesn't matter how I move or tweak the antenna, there is still too much static.  I do not listen to the radio, because of the antenna."
650,Great splitter does the job
651,"It is possible to download a Windows XP driver for this device. However, you really don't need one. I tried the touchpad with the XP driver and without, and found that the pre-installed generic XP driver provided smoother cursor motion. Of course, if you want all the special Glidepoint features, you need the XP driver from the Fellowes Web site, but I found the Glidepoint features to be more annoying than helpful, and the cursor motion became somewhat unpredictable. I recommend just hooking this device up to your Windows XP machine and letting the pre-installed XP (Home Edition) driver do the work. If you do, you'll find that this touchpad functions exceptionally well, and is a great value for the money - much better than those combo keyboard-touchpad devices, which are harder to use and less ergonomically satisfying."
652,I rated this a 4 stars because some of the tools slip out of their holsters very easily.  But it does come with a lot of useful tools that I use almost everyday.
653,"works very well, just recently go this and a Hoya for a different lens.  Both work very well on their respective lenses, and I've quite happy with both."
654,"The item performs like any other USB 2.0, but I wished I had realized it was 10 long. Bulky, but works great otherwise."
655,"The adapter works, but not perfect. Everything plugs in tight and there is a signal but the connection is not 100%. The main line works well, but the splitter plugs for the headphones have a crappy connection. Once plugged in the headphone plugs would have to be rotated within the connector to achieve a good sound signal. Otherwise the sound is not clear and somewhat tuned down. When you find the perfect position the signal is good. Works and cheap, but I expected better!I used in for a laptop watching a movie on a plane. Would have been happier if the connection worked well.The packaging does say Belkin, but sometimes I question these cheap products which are in many cases counterfeit fakes."
656,"Bought these to replace a pair that gave up the ghost after 25 years. Best investment then, and now. A classic like this should never die. Hopefully they never will."
657,"The length is 25 feet.  However, I find the cord tangles and result = out of shape.  Other than that the cord works well."
658,"I should have listened to the other reviewer who said that even at volume '1' this thing is too loud. There is a digital volume that goes from like 0 to 50 or something. I've never tried over 3. If the kid is sleeping, 1 is too loud to watch a movie.Also no inputs, so you can't run a VCR or something through it.The menus were a bit confusing. It took several minutes to figure out how to watch PG movies or enable the surround speakers.Don't throw away the docs, you'll need the password pin."
659,"I purchased this because the built-in ethernet port on an older iMac failed.  I was surprised when it arrived because the CD said it had Macintosh drivers that *should* have worked with the iMac in questions (hardware, software, etc. met the requirements).  However, the device would not connect to the Internet, although the computer saw the device.  I installed the free drivers from [...] and then it worked instantly.  The hardware itself seems to be working fine, but I lost an hour of my life trying to make D-Link's drivers work.Bottom Line:  Buy one for your Mac if you need it (price and h/w specs are good), but just use the free driver and ignore the D-Link CD."
660,I will never buy anything from this company again. This was the worst deal I have ever tried to make. They never sent the product and never answered my emails about it. Amazon lets them get away with treating people like this and allows them to sell on their site. I hold Amazon as responsible as the seller. I will never buy another product from Amazon or go to their site until they stop and ban this seller from their site. i have been waiting on an answer from them. After this all emails and ads from Amazon will go to my spam. I have given them enough time to respond and they are much like this seller so I see why they allow this. Go to Ebay and you will not have this problem.
661,"If it is music, gaming, movies, or whatever, these headphones are great.  Comfortable to wear with high quality music.  The swival ears are great if you need to keep one ear semi open to hear events around you.Only negative would be the ear pieces tend to fit on the ear as opposed to around them."
662,"The 6ft phone cord supplied with the DSL modem providerwas too short for my installation.  Extending it with anRJ11 coupler and another phone cord resulted in a configurationwith appreciable soft errors.  Specifically, Sagemcom's 1704 providesrecoverable error statistics and a bit error rate test:Device Info->Statistics-->xDSLIn theory, there is no need for RS Correctable Errorswith a D (interleaver depth) of 1, but errors generally accumulate over time.The 1740 supports resetting these statistics.Before installing Belkin's modem cable,correctable errors occurred during xDSL BER test execution.After installation, no errors occur during a 20 second xDSL BER test.While many things affect actual thruput, reducing recoverable errorshas improved this consumer's Internet experience."
663,I don't think these new speakers are as good as the older cyber acoustic models. They just don't have good sound.
664,"I'm admittedly sort-of a brand-whore when it comes to sound. I like my Klipsch, Sennheiser, Grados, etc. I dislike BOSE for the cheap materials, over-marketing business model. I'm annoyed by Beats headphones that are just Monster headphones with Dr. Dre's name and over-boosted bass tones - but sold in awesome bright colors. Hey, I respect that Beats is bringing attention back to cans, I really do, but they're not good sounding headphones.I have a nice pair of Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones I can't always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature. Also if I'm doing activities, the Sennheisers are huge and cumbersome, not practical if I'm running, washing my car, or otherwise moving about quickly. I have a great pair of Klipsch earbuds, and those are fantastic for running. But they have poor bass response.The Koss PortaPros are fantastic, almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras. It does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you, but you won't be left complaining. The bass response will destroy those of any earbud-style headphone, but you know that. Koss' drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive, and they do well to replicate bass from an on-the-ear design.The downside? Yes, the looks. Hey, they're not bright-colored pastels that scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" In fact, they are ugly and say ""stay the hell AWAY from me!"" but if you're not buying headphones for the image (and you really shouldn't be), then you shouldn't care. They look dorky for a reason, though: each side has a switch that allows you to set firmness, allowing the buds to ""flex"" outward. This makes for very comfortable wearing. So if you're not trying to impress the kids at your high school and instead want to save some money and get good sound, check out the Koss PortaPros.The best part is they're so inexpensive, if they ever do break or get lost, stolen, etc.... you don't care.  If my brother lost his Dres, he'd kill somebody. But my PortaPros? It's $25 bucks man. I just go order another. :D"
665,"The Koss UR-20 is a sensational set of headphones for such a modest price. The sound is rich, full, and clear. The bass is deep, the treble sparkles, and the noise-cancelling pads keep everything going in the right direction. You can really enjoy the music while those around you are going about their own affairs.Unlike so many lower-priced models, the volume is more than adequate. I'm using them right now, and I've had to turn the sound down three times since the music began. With other sets in the same price range, you can crank the sound up as far as it will go, and it's still barely audible. The Koss UR-20 really gets the job done.The headband is comfortable, and the weight is not outrageous. You're always aware that you have them on, but it's neither unpleasant nor distracting. The one downside is that over time (and I've had mine for years,) the pads shed a bit, tiny black particles of vinyl flaking off. Once they're completely gone, the cloth beneath still holds up well. It's actually more comfortable without the vinyl coating.I use these headphones every day, sometimes for hours at a time, and they are still going strong. I couldn't be more pleased."
666,"As so many of the other reviews posted, I can't say too much more about this other than it works really good on a home stereo system, and only mediocre in a car.  In my wife's car, it works pretty good, but in my car, it is constant static and interference.  The sound quality is very low; worst than most FM broadcasts.  Where I live there are strong radio broadcasts on all four of the frequency settings, so I experience constant static and noise on every setting.  It's a good idea, but it doesn't work nearly as well as you're led to believe."
667,"Seemed to drop traffic when attempting to program my scanner, resulting in timeout errors.  Look for an adapter with an FTDI chipset instead."
668,Great sound. Comfortable on head and ears. Ears do get warm after a 90 minute movie. I hope they last a long time.
669,"Should have read the reviews first, got the product on Sept. 24, 2012. Well, after setting things to be plugged in. The power was not going through. Tried different plugs and no go. I am returning the product. And hopefully will find a proper RCA adapter that works."
670,"Look, a great number of people I know exclaim about how great Canon's are in general, especially the S400. I am going to talk about why the Sony DSC P10 destroys the Canon S400 and to address the gripes of other reviewers.The only advantages the Canon S400 has over the Sony P10 are as follows:1. Flash is more centered over lens of camera to avoid &quot;shadow&quot; effect2. Compactflash memory is cheaper3. Double sided memory sticks are &quot;bad&quot;4. The S400 has 9 points of autofocus, compared to the P10's 3Yes, I know the flash on the Sony is not centered over the lens, thus in theory it would cast shadows over the subject, BUT in practice, THIS HARDLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. For the most part, I have not even noticed that this was possible, but in those small instances if I payed extremely close attention, I could notice that something small and insignificant placed in a very specific way in front of the subject was casting a slight shadow on the subject in like 1 in 100 of the night pictures I take.This is FAR outweighed by the fact that Canon's in general, and this PARTICULAR Canon, has THE WORST lighting problems I have ever seen. SKIN TONES, COMPLETELY wrong. Canon has a history of problems with underexposing color tones and this camera is no different. Using TWO different A400's, the skin tones of people in the pictures often comes out terrible. People's skin often comes out EXTRAORDINARILY yellow and fuzzy. I am not sure what causes this problem, but this ALONE renders the camera completely useless in mild light conditions. Go develop some night pictures off the A400 before you buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about. The skin tones come out all wrong and it is obvious to almost everybody. Especially if you are Asian! They're not THAT yellow! Compare the pictures side by side to the Sony P10 and I guarantee you can tell.First of all, compactflash memory is only cheaper than memory sticks if you don't know how to shop. Sure, if you buy a Viking Compactflash card then it'll be cheaper, but then again you shouldn't be doing that anyways since Viking makes dangerously terrible cards. Furthermore, if you shop on amazon.com, you can buy a 256MB SONY brand memory stick for practically the same price as a reputable maker of a CF card!I agree, that memory stick pros are not that great since they have that really odd copyright protection, but if you plan to only put pictures on this card, then that should not even be an issue. Also, people have complained about the &quot;double-sided&quot; memory sticks and how inconvenient they are. Both me and my dad have one and we actually think it's better than a conventional 256MB stick. First of all, if you have an MP3 player then it would be nice to keep MP3's on one side of the card and pictures on the other. You don't want to mix the two, and it's a great way of dividing it. Why would you not want to mix the two? Say you wanted to format the card to delete all your pictures so that you can take a whole new round of pictures. If you had a 256MB compactflash, you would delete all your MP3's as well, or you would have to delete each of your 100 pictures one by one.With the double sided stick, you can just delete one side at a time, leaving all your MP3's. The same holds true if you are just taking only pictures as well. If you want to keep some pictures or movies on your card for a presentation or demonstration on a TV, then you can keep those pictures on one side of the card, and then continue formatting and taking pictures on the other side freely. And when you do have to switch the sides, it really isn't annoying at all. You just take out the card and move one button. This is far easier than tying your shoes. So one reviewer named tmchow complained on switching sides to the memory stick that it was &quot;Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it&quot;He must wear velcro shoes or something, because if you can do simple things like tie your shoes, SURELY you can press one button, really it's not hard at all.And WHY on EARTH would a non-professional photographer need NINE points of autofocus?!? That would mean you would like to focus on an object NOT in the center of the picture and leave everything else blurry. So this spectacular feature would come in handy in the following situation, you are taking a picture of two people at a restaurant but you would like to focus on the salt shaker, but leave the two people fuzzy. USELESS. So basically if you would ever like to focus on something completely outside the center of the picture but leave the remaining 90% of the picture fuzzy, buy this Canon for the wonderful autofocus flexibility.So let's look at why the Sony P10 is clearly better:1. I like people's skin to look like how it does in real life.that ALONE should be enough, but let's carry on2. Sony P10 is 5 megapixel3. 20% longer battery life, VERY important in digital photography4. Takes great pictures in the dark, and even has a solid night modeSome people get completely lost in megapixels and think that more megapixels is better and forget the rest of the camera. Not true, megapixels only matter if you are blowing up your pictures to uncommon and extravagant sizes like 20 X 30. In this case, the Sony P10 takes far better night pictures as well as having more megapixels. But if you really insist on messing up everyone's skin tones, go right ahead and buy this camera.People keep talking about how compact the A400 is. Well, in my experience, pants pockets generally are rectangular, not square. Making the Sony P10 a far better fit when it comes to a conventional pocket.Overall, Canon cameras are completely overrated by all those blind Canon lovers. Don't be biased!"
671,The female end of this cable is larger than a 3.5 mm making for a terrible connection and scratchy sound.Other people but not all have noted the same thing.I have used BlueRigger cables without problems and will stick with them next time.
672,"So far the splitter works, but the connection to the radio is loose. If someone bumps into it, it falls out. Sometimes I tape it on. As far as the sound goes, the music loses a little quality, but for my purposes it's good enough. Two kids can listen to one radio."
673,"The cord is thick and sturdy, and the shielding is visible through the transparent jacket.  The connectors are easy to handle.  It's pretty much a high quality Cat5 ethernet cable terminated on standard RJ11 connectors.  As some have noted, the connectors lock in rather tightly.  To disconnect, I push the tab all the way down and push the connector slightly to one side.  That seems to permit the connector to release more easily.My house is an early 90s house with Cat3 wiring for the phone lines.  Centurylink provides the DSL and I'm paying for 20Mbps service.  The service tech noted 17Mbps at the jack (one of the longest runs in the house) with his test equipment.  While Speedtest.net is not generally an accurate measurement of bandwidth (because it's heavily dependent on the network and servers _outside_ of Centurylink's control), I rarely got over 12Mbps during actual computer use.I started by connecting my DSL modem using a plain ol' telephone cord.  I ran three tests using Speedtest.net immediately before and after installing this hi-speed modem cable.  I made sure to use the same test servers on the website.  I saw no noticeable change in bandwidth after the hi-speed cable was installed.Was it worth the expense to me, even though I see no appreciable change in bandwidth?  Yep...because for a paltry seven bucks I was able to remove one potential bottleneck in my network.  Going forward as I improve the wiring in the house, I won't have to wonder if the old and basic phone cords are responsible for bandwidth problems."
674,"As others have said, the Expert Mouse Pro was flatter, no torque on the wrist and very pleasant to use - this on the other hand has about a half inch more incline forcing the wrist to take the brunt of that.  A half inch doesn't seem like much, but after two days of this, I can already feel my hand numbing and my wrist getting tired.  All simply from the angle.  Otherwise the product is solid - but after using the Expert Mouse Pro for 10 years without issue, I can't take 2 days of this and I'm returning it."
675,"I got this device and immediately loved it.  HOWEVER, I have a USB mouse and I used a USB to PS/2 converter to make it work with this KVM. Over time my USB mouse has stopped working properly and I have to unplug the mouse for several seconds and plug it back in.  Otherwise, it does odd things like completely locking up, causing my browser to go backwards and forwards and sometimes closing windows.  So, I dug into the documentation and found where it does indeed say that you can't use USB devices with it, which make this purchase was a COMPLETE waste of my money.  I suppose it was my fault, but they could have made the USB - PS/2 conversion incompatibility more eye catching.  It is very interesting that their USB version of this device is almost twice as expensive.Update: After going through two USB mice, I tried another USB mouse (same type of mouse) and the mouse has been working fine for probably 6 months.  So, I'm not sure if it was the mouse or the IOGear device."
676,Unfortunately I had to send it back because it was damaged in shipping. I tested the amp on my system and it seems to function ok. The amp gave off a sight buzz but it did not appear to be in the sound coming from my speakers. Overall I was disappointed. I'm going to spend the extra money on an &#34;Emotiva&#34;.
677,"You can only be careful when you buy something that looks good but it is too cheap, and these headphones do look great, they do feel comfy, they cover my entire ear, and the sound it is awesome, so yes I took the risk and I did right, these headphones for sure deliver great sound and the best part of it the price.. I totally recommend them, just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok, if all you want is to listen music, or just watch movies with these, they are great.."
678,"Update:[ June 2011]After the swivel joints broke back in 2000 (around three years of use), I was able to easily put them back using super glue. Since then, I have purchased and used other headphones but still occasionally use the v700 headphones. It's definitely very worn out--the (replaceable) padding is cracked and the fit feels a bit loose--but, they still sound great and the joints have not broken off again. Yeah, after it was literally broken-in, they prove to stand strong with some glue on the joints--I've DJ'd with them, slept with them, and dropped them and I am  still using them with joy. It's been with me for over ten years! I got it a few years after I graduated from college (DJ'd with them) and now I am almost 40 with 2 kids and, I still use them! Amazing. Now, I will use them with care.{Original ""review"" from 2004]When I first purchased these headphones back in 1998,I would have given these earphones 5 stars. But after around 3 years of use, the swivels broke. The swivels are made of plastic, so the first place that falls apart is the swivel joint that connects to the cups. Both left and right joints are cracking after approximately three years of moderate use. Luckily, it is still functional even with the cracks. The problem is that it is now a bit looser so it falls off from my head even more frequently. And we all know that these earphones (including the v600) are notorious when it comes to the deterioration of the padding on the ear cups. I just wish that it would last just a bit longer. I have been looking to replace these and I found the new pioneer hdj-1000 to be a possibility. It sounds just as good, it is definitely lighter and stays on the head steadier; and even though the construction is similar in that it is plastic, the swivel joints are built differenly from the V700DJs which makes me think they knew about this SONY's problem and they have found a way to prevent the joints from cracking."
679,"This wallet does what I need, hold memory cards.Unfortunately, the clip on the back which allows it to attach to a belt or Sliplock loop (as on lowepro bags) is not super secure. The button snap comes apart easily, and the velcro is not as strong as it should be.The pockets are different sizes, and the smaller ones are a *very* tight fit for a compactflash card in its plastic case.A few small changes to the design of this product would make it absolutely perfect."
680,"Every night, I listen to a CD (Holosync by Centerpointe) while going to sleep.  The CD has a range of frequencies, from deep bass (down to as low as 20 Hz) to mid-range.  Also, since I travel frequently, the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones (by Sennheiser) died, I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint, with my old Sennheiser headphones, I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio, at slightly lower volume, than I can with these headphones.  Then again, the Sennheiser headphones cost $250, while these cost $70.However, my Sony headphones serve me very well.  They produce good (but not great) sound, so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume.  Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable, the top is padded, and the headphones themselves are lightweight, I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy, keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that, the headphones themselves are sturdy, standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch.  Also, they are very affordable (about $70 from Amazon.com).The only issue is, if I wanted headphones to use while working out, these headphones wouldn't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat.  However, for my non-workout needs, these are excellent.Although the audio isn't quite professional quality, these are an excellent set of headphones for the money."
681,"There's not much to say here others haven't said,  these are just fantastic neutral-sounding and comfortable headphones.If you want emphasized bass or crackling highs - especially in noisy places like outdoors and on public transit - these might sound too flat for you - you're going to want some MTX iX1's or something like that. If you prefer a softer, natural sound or if you are doing production work these are probably what you want.  They'll last you a long time in a studio or bedroom, too."
682,"I leave my original review intact - that said, this hub does not work correctly.  I put it against a USB 'scope and watched the packets.  It does not operate to spec.  On most computers, this will not matter.  On any with a strict USB implementation, this does not meet it.  That explains the behavior on the G4 laptop with/without power adapter plugged in.  On a desktop, the power issue will never come into play, which is why it apparently works, but on many laptops, it will fail, even with power plugged in.====I got this hub to provide me with 4 USB 2.0 ports on my Apple Powerbook G4.  My iPod Shuffle needed power and would not mount via 2.0, only the USB1.1 port.  This is advertised as a powered hub and I did in fact plug it in, but apparently it does not announce itself as such to the computer.  My thumb drive would not work through the hub -- it would work directly -- power or no power.  I kept getting low power warnings and the drive wouldn't appear.  The Shuffle just didn't work - but I did not expect it to at this point.I know the USB2.0 port on this laptop in a little strict in its implementation, but the hub should have at least powered a thumb drive (it did light its LED) and allow the computer to detect it.  I returned it and got a small Belkin four-port powered hub called the ""Clip Hub"".  Plugged it in and connected it with two thumb drives, and my iPod shuffle to the same USB port on the laptop -- no problems and quick performance."
683,I bought this 1 year ago and slowly one port after another started going dead after about 6 months of use.  Now all the ports are dead and the switch seems to be in a continuous reboot mode.  This is my first Netgear switch and I am not sure I would buy another.
684,"I guess if you are going for an older camera to save money, this isn't a bad choice, but I would recommend looking at newer ones.  Like most electronic gadgets, they get better every year.Pros:- generally easy to use- uses standard AA batteries- no lens cap to lose- software - easy web page publishing in professional versionCons- a little too big to be pocketable- there are comparable cameras with 10x and even 12x optical zoom- no stabilization feature- lacks shutter-priority, aperature-priority, and manual modes- difficult to impossible to get good pictures of indoor sporting events and other low-light situations where the flash does no good or you can't use the flash (actually, this is probably true of many other consumer-level cameras)- slow reaction time - push the button and it takes the picture about a second later (or not at all if it thinks you need the flash)- menus aren't explained very well in the manual- software - version that comes with the camera is crippled, but the professional version freezes occasionallyDespite what somebody else said, backing up files to a cd isn't that hard if you know what you are doing; you just have to mount the CD so it looks like any other disk drive.  I had no problems with this.Anyway, I'd say spend a little more money and get a Panasonic with 12X zoom, image stabilization, and some of the other features mentioned above.  You could also go for a camera with higher MP, but I'd rather spend my money on features that will actually help me take better pictures, not just bigger ones."
685,"I was intrigued by the reviews of the previous version of the Sangean Pocket Radio FM/AM DT-210V (w/the now obsolete TV band) and the need to have a portable radio perform as well as a car radio.I walk in an area 20-30 miles from my stations of interest, and have had lots of reception issues with previous portable mp3 devices with radio receivers; lots of fading and directional issues etc.  The current model is a DT-210 (w/o TV band) and is the one pictured and still titled as the DT-210V on the Amazon site.This unit although nicely designed, is much larger than the Sansa player I was previously using.  In fact the 2 AAA batteries alone are larger than my previous player.  Unfortunately it doesn't perform better in any way, and I think most portable digital receivers in mp3 players will perform as well if not better for lots less cost.For those needing AM capability the DT-210 is even more disappointing.  The unit's AM & FM receiving capabilities are no where close to pervious Sangean table or shower radios I have used, and don't come close to Tivoli or the much reviewed GE/RCA Superadio.  I think this model has been value engineered out of its outstanding status,"
686,Pretty decent for a zoom lens. It does the job if you need a zoom lens Auto focus can be a little tricky.
687,"Before these head phones, I purchased Senneheiser PMX 80. Those sound very good and comfortable while running. But they are not when working out. So I wanted to try these headphones because of cheap price. I was eager to try these head phones. But when I put these on my ears, they are very lose. I think these are good for only larger ears. Then I tried them with my IPOD. Sound quality is horrible. These is no bass. The default headphones that came with ipod sound better."
688,"Be aware that this device does not work with all printers. In fact any printer that relies too heavily upon it's Windows driver will probably be too dumb to work. At least that's my take from this Trendnet Tech Support response:""Please check with the manufacture of your printer and make sure that the printer is not a Host based or a GDI printer.""I'm uncertain what ""host based"" or ""GDI"" mean, except that wikipedia says GDI is a Windows component.In practice it means that my old Xerox Docuprint P8 laser doesn't work with this gadget. Too bad the Trendnet website doesn't offer more clues about which printers work and which don't."
689,Hosa cables are pretty good as long as yuo dont get too rough with them . They are not repairable. So once they short out they are done. For the price thry are not too bad.
690,"well, I've got those for free since the person who gave them to me had my old Paradigm monitors and let them get wet in the basement... make long story short.  I love music, and music sounds better with good speakers! when I watch a movie those Bose are not too bad but I have them hooked up to an Onkyo receiver with a 12"" Paradigm sub and they sound bad! what a shame. my first and LAST Bose speakers. who ever tell you on those reviews that those speakers are good, doesn't know what he/she is talking about and had never listen to a good set.the mids are flat, the highs are pitchy and there is no bass and even with a good sub, they just rewin the music. I listen to a lot of classical and operas and the mids are very important but all that is happening is losing the good vocals. I have enough bass thanks to the sub but those Bose...comon, give me a break... buy a low end no name speakers and get more sound. one more thing: you need a lot of power to push them, much more then good speakers do."
691,"As many others indicated in their reviews, this tripod uses very lightweight materials - aluminum and plastic. That makes for a very unsteady tripod. There are some convenience features, (the level which isn't accurate, the easy release) but none that make up for the fact that you will not get sturdiness from this tripod. I have a Sony DSLR that displays an icon when the shot will not be steady; when I use the camera with this tripod, I almost never get a Steady Shot indicator. I've had the tripod for a year and don't use it very often - when I do, it's mostly for setting up the camera waiting for wildlife to come along. This tripod does most of the job it's designed to do, except for the most important -- keeping the camera steady. Not recommended."
692,"These earphones do weird things at 4kHz and above.  No amount of EQ-ing seems to fix it.  Get some Sennheiser CX300s, 400s, or 500s instead.  As someone who has spent the past 10 years working with audio gear, trust me on this one.  This is not brand favoritism, as I have other Sony headphones that I like (check out my headphones list).  These are just bad."
693,This pen has a problem with losing its hair. Had to seen my camera end to get the hair from the pin cleaned.
694,"The cable cannot work in a car or anywhere where you need it to be protected from magnetic interference.If you want a cable that can connect your iPhone/iPod to your car, buy something else. This is worth 1 cent; not much more."
695,"However, the soldering iron is not all that good, i'd recommend getting something a bit more professional, other than thatthe tools available are pretty much standard and covers your basic needs. (at least in my case!)"
696,"Speaking from real experience, don't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price. I bought a few top of the line monster cables once I got the top of the line SONY XBR960 HDTV. Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means. Stop buying this ridiculously priced cables, and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list. Digital is digital. Don't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 ... than others."
697,"Had I read nicho1as's review and taken it seriously, I could have saved myself a trip back to Fry's returns line.I am using the 'old' Kensington expert mouse (i.e. Kensington's classic opto-mechnical, four-button trackball, that is built like a tank) for over 6 years, the non-optical tracking system gets annoying once in a while when is starts losing tracking, and needs some cleaning to get back to working order. After also using traditional optical mouse and learning to appreciate it's merits over old ball mouse I though the optical trackball would be a real improvement over the opto-mechanical trackball circa 1997... - BIG mistake!It could be, in theory, sure - but Kensignton have tried to save few bucks on their manufacturing costs, and, it's really easy to tell. Gone are the massive, smooth, steel bearings, instead you'll find cheap red miniature plastic balls that support the &quot;diamond eye&quot; trackball. The result is an unpleasant movement feel, perhaps folks using trackball for the first time aren't aware of it, but the older version trackball clearly had a superior feel, and higher quality plastics as well.I can easily say that this optical trackball, taken out of the box, feels about the same as the mechanical trackball when it gets dirty after months of use, and the old trackball is not such a pain to clean.Returning it was as easy decision - I did not even have to connect it to the PC to make the decision. I guess I will be using the mechanical trackball for another six years unless Kensington decide to design a professional quality optical trackball before."
698,"I made a bipolar FM antenna for my receiver worth $2.5 and wanted to compare this product for betterment of signal. Also I bought FM transmitter for my iPOD (that works perfect in my car) and wanted to listen through the receiver wireless at home. But its very disappointing that this product couldn't deliver any better signal (static less) from the existing free to air FM channels. Even in case of iPOD FM transmitted signal (may be 2-3 feet apart from the antenna) couldn't get picked up staticless. If I position my dipole antenna carefully, it serves the purpose. Its so surprising that this product is worse than my handmade dipole antenna. I've to look for something else. So I guess this antenna is better than nothing."
699,Great product for the price.  All the tools (and more) that I need and organized so I always know if I'm leaving something behind.  Not Snap On quality... but great for the price.
700,Routinely looses major parts of the signal--like color.  Picture looks like black and white with green tint.  Power off and on and it is fine for a few minutes.  Full of odd user interface hangs.  Press a key not anticiptaed in the current menu and you have to power off to get it back.  Typical of my experience with Samsung products--poor software engineering.
701,"Since it's not posted on any of their products, I thought you should know that Panasonic DVD products come with a 90 days warranty on labor and 1 year on parts.  That means when your unit breaks in 6 months, (Hard drive fails, motherboard dies, drive breaks) the part will be covered, but they will charge you the labor to install it!  On a unit at this price, you might consider it worth it, but on cheaper DVD players, the labor costs more than the players themselves, so you just have to trash it and buy a Philips.BUYER BEWARE"
702,"Usually, my rule of thumb when buying cables is to purchase the .cheapest set I can find. The reason is that the technology to produce the components and finished parts is mature, and all QC issues should have been addressed and any kinks worked out. Up  until now, that has worked well for me. Up until now. Sadly, this set of cables only worked for two weeks before the female connector failed, with only one channel working. A couple of days later, it failed completely.Pros: Arrived quickly. Worked when received. All parts were included, cable, female and male connector. Matched photograph. Low cost.Cons: Thick, not too flexible,  rapid failure at the strain relief or inside the connector,  low cost prohibits returning due to effort and return postage."
703,"The cable does what it claims: It provides a 5' long link from the Celestron Nexstar hand controller to the RS-232 port of your computer. That few, if any laptops (or desktops) have an RS-232 port doesn't seem to matter to Celestron. You will need a serial port to USB adapter, meaning more expense and complication. If you want a lot of expense, Celestron will be happy to sell you one. I gotthis one.Another comment. Five feet is quite short for use in the field. Some USB adapters add length, but you may also want to budget for another extension cable.Finally, I control my mount with a Linux powered netbook running Debian Linux, and the program Cartes du Ciel. In addition I installed the package Indi-bin. The USB device that pops up on the computer is usually /dev/ttyUSB0. You will need to ensure your user is in the ""dialout"" group. Even then you may run into trouble ""writing"" to the USB device. The simplest workaround is to make /dev/ttyUSB0 universally writable by issuing the following command as root, or by prefacing the following command with ""sudo"":chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0"
704,"I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.  The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it ""should,"" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.The cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I'm used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.I've compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50's (which I own) and a library's Koss UR-10's or 15's (can't remember which).  Though the QZ-50's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20's are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won't eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50's."
705,"Liked this one so well I ordered another for my other lens, much better than the AFGA Photo polarizer  that I also bought from Amazon as it had issues."
706,"I've been using this radio for about six months now.  I don't actually use it very often because of the poor reception; I have an old cassette walkman that gets better FM reception and gets used more often.  The good points on this radio are (1) simple to use, (2) small and light, (3) only uses one AAA battery, which lasts a long time, and (4) has weather band.  However, the FM reception is very poor. Signal separation is very poor, even when listening to powerful local stations.  Reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord.  In general, acceptable reception is only possible in open-air sites, with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord, and while remaining immobile.  I plan to discard this unit and buy a Sangean."
707,"This Antenna has served it's purposed well for me watching basic stations, like Fox, NBC, ABC, and CBS.  It has trouble picking-up PBS sometimes, which really annoys me.It was an improvement over the previous Antenna I had, that was meant for analog signals.  However I bought a $20 GE Flat Panel Antenna at Target, and it worked much better than the RCA.  I find sometimes I need to adjust the RCA for it to get a signal.  It also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room.  No Problems with the GE.  I even attached a signal amplifier to it, and it didn't seem to help much.  I would just get a another Antenna for a little more money."
708,"If you order, you have to wait for it to ship from overseas. 1 Month in my case. Then the big disappointment. The computer will recognize the adapter, but not the devices connected (keyboard/mouse) I bought 5 of the because they were so cheap. All five are now in the trash. Waste of time and money."
709,"I don't understand how something so simple could go so wrong. The problem with this device is that I wasn't able to fully plug anything 3.5mm into it. My headphones would only go halfway in. Same with the Gogrove. This should be a no-brainer. I could hear audio with it half-way plugged in, but they just fall out. I tried pushing very firmly, but nothing would fully enter the connector from either side. I had purchased 4 of these, but I'm returning all of them."
710,Thank you Sony. This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.
711,"The sound quality from the MDR-G57 is excellent, with crystal clear output at the highest volume and minimal distortion. These headphones were obviously designed with portable CD players in mind. While the sound quality is nice, the design is, to say the least, unique. Rather than forcing the user to ruin their carefully sculpted hair style by putting headphones over it, these phones go behind the neck, saving face and hair.The design does present a few problems, though. The first is the lack of size adjustment. Luckily, my head is neither too big or too small, but it can definitely be a problem to people with smaller or larger heads. Sounds silly, I know, but being too tight or too big can seriously cause discomfort. My friend bought these headphones and had the problem with her ears getting sore because she couldn't adjust the earpieces. One warning to all, though, prolonged use does cause irritation on the tops of the ears. Also, to people with glasses, you might want to reconsider buying these particular headphones, because the phones themselves take over the whole ear, preventing you from properly putting on your glasses.The other drawback in the design is the bleedthrough, more so on these than other open-ear design headphones. Be careful of the volume if travelling on a bus or a plane, because the people sitting around you will definitely hear what you are listening to.But all that said, I am happy with these headphones, though I see the drawbacks for many people, and experienced a few of them myself. For the price, these are a great deal. For sound quality, these have it where it counts, for design, it's depends on the person."
712,"*** UPDATE 1/21/11 ***  I've found that the design is not a problem at all with my workout.  I've change my rating to 5-star as the sound is absolutely terrific.  Compare very favorably if not better than my PortaPros and Sennheiser HD238's.I should have read the reviews more carefully and I would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like I wanted.  The picture does not indicate this at all, nor is it specified in the description.  Dual may technically be better for sound than single, but for my purposes it is awkward.  I primarily use a rowing machine which means I place my player down on the floor next to me while using, then the rower has quite a bit of forward/back motion.  The dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome, and the cord also winds up being too short, I will at least need an extender.I haven't played much with the fit, but it does seem that over-the-head is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck.  That's ok with me but I would have preferred the other.They seem to sound good, and for the price I haven't risked much, but had I known the design I would have kept looking.  I'll try these for awhile but I may not be able to use them for my purposes at all."
713,"Took some trial and error, but finally got it connected to my plasma tv.  What I planned to use this for was for straightforward playback only.  No trying to tape things while playing on DVD, no taping of broadcasts, and no fancy editing.  Just pushing play.The biggest surprise is that only original DVD-ROMs seem to play back without any issues.  Almost all of my DVD+R's (recorded on the Philips DVDR985 no less) start to skip about 20 minutes into the film.  I noticed that the same films on DVD+RW seem to play without any skips.The skips look like simple jumps of a split second at first.  Then the image suddenly freezes up in a multi-cascade manner.  At first it happened when I was jumping ahead a chapter or two and when fast-forwarding.  When I wanted to watch a movie straight through it did it again.It must be something with this model.  The same DVD+R discs play fine on my other Philips, on my Sony player, and on my computer.Can't seem to find an answer as to why it skips so bad on DVD+Rs."
714,"I have an Embroidery Machine that I purchased at the end of 2004. I did a lot of reading before using it and found out that SanDisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs. They are the ONLY brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs (I had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash).I have bought almost 3,000 designs over the years and I always trust using a SanDisk Compact Flash card over anything else on the market!"
715,"I was excited to get this product for a gift, only to discover it becomes unuseable with static when you are sitting in front of a plasma TV. It works fine with a stereo and possibly with other TV's, but not a plasma. The problem is with the IR between the headphones and the base. Maybe if your far enough away it would work, but if you want to sit in a normal viewing distance, look for something else. Also, the sound volume is somewhat limited."
716,not exactly snagless--lacks protective tubing
717,Need to make sure you push both head phone jacks in hard. May need to turn and rotate jacks to get full volume.
718,"I like the display of the DS330 and it's features are very nice. However, when I compared the recording quality against the Sony ICD-BP150, the difference was like day and night. If you want it just for voice recording, it might work just fine. I wanted good quality recording so that I can record my piano playing. On the DS330, the recorded piano sound hardly sounded like anything but broken music. It also has annoying background noises which becomes very obvious when the volume is turned up. The Sony BP150 also had switches on the back which allows easy control of VOR and playback speed. Whereas on the DS330, you have to go through a set of menu options to make the necessary adjustments."
719,"I used to own a Palm V, but sold it because it didn't have enough memory.  I only had enough money to buy this Platinum, so I did.Pros: Fast during use and USB syncronization is greatCons: Clunky, Big, and Fat.I also got this because it is compatible with the Omnisky wireless service.  There are other Visors out there with 8MB ram, but no compatability with Omnisky.If there is a way for Handspring to deliver a Platinum in a Palm V form factor, that would be great.I don't mind there not being a rechargeable solution to the Platinum because i often go on trips and when I had the Palm V, the batteries would run down.  I certainly did not lug around the charger for the Palm V so I was out of luck when battery power was out.  Now, on trips, all I do is pack a few AAAs and I'm fine."
720,"I like the build quality and number of ports. The last few USB hubs I bought would become flaky after a few months.I have two problems with the high-power ports.1. The software you have to install to make the hi-power ports work, will ask for admin privileges every time you reboot your computer. I have no idea why or how to make it stop.2. The high power ports would only turn up the power if you unplugged the hub from the computer. Weird. From what I read the software you install is supposed to allow this to happen automatically, but it never did.So it is a nice nub, but that high-power feature is a total fail and why I give it 3 stars and not 5."
721,"The mouse buttons are not buttons at all but long thin plastic strips.  I didn't think much of it until my mouse buttons started sticking or not working at all.  A $5 mouse works better than this super expensive one.  Earlier, I also found out this mouse will not work with black mousepads, even brand new mousepads.  The mouse cursor stuttered and stopped while using it.  You have to get a mousepad with textured colors.  And when I first bought this thing the first thing I noticed was how heavy it is.  It took a good while to get used to it, and once you are, going back to a regular mouse feels weird."
722,Used this for more hard drive power connections for my file server... Pretty simple and it worked for my application...
723,"Just as described, perfect fit and good quality, I would redone this product to anyone as it is working out perfectly."
724,"I have a lot of these discs that I bought several years ago which were made in Japan. They never failed. So when itune complained that the disc needs to be calibrated when the burn failed. I was truly surprised. It is made in China (marked above UPC code). I paid premium price for this kind of junk. Even the Memorex discs I bought in Walmart (made in Taiwan) are much better than these. BTW, I ordered CD-R (PHOTO) PRO but received CD-R PRO."
725,"My 2 Antenna version is still working after 3 years. I rarely will have to reboot it.  The wireless functions work ok too, however there are newer routers out there that have a lot more features.  Speaking of features, most of the configuration settings don't work.  For instance, the Port 80 remote management, never worked right from the get go.I would like to upgrade my router to one with more wireless security features however since this baby still works like a champ with my desktop, I'm going to keep it and run ethernet cables throughout my house to the other computers and not set up a wireless network.If you can still find this router out there, you may want to get it for it's solid stability but as mentioned, don't get your hopes up too high with the browser based configuration settings.DAN"
726,"I got this for a friend over a year ago & barely now they're showing signs of use. Sony deff made a good job on this one.The bass lines are so neat & clear...and no matter how high you put the volume, still sounds clean."
727,"I  have owned many pairs of head phones over the years and listened to many more.  These offer simply the best sound experience that I have had.  I have even listened with more costly Sony headphones and found them lacking in comparison to these.  I have been able to rediscover some of my music with these wonderful head phones.They are so good that many members of my family have also recently bought them.  If you love to really hear your music, do yourself a favor and buy a pair of these, but make sure you read the warnings - they can cause damage to credit card magnetic strips and mechanical devices with small springs (e.g.  watches)."
728,Nice filter great for sky and water shots. I liked the results using it to shoot in a forested area that had a lot of different lighting.
729,"This radio does not have any oomph to it! My husband works (driving a route)in the city where he always has listened to the local stations, that is until his old radio died! I bought this to replace it and all it does is emit a fuzzy static sound over a station. It sounds as if you're trying to get a signal from a distance too far! Save your money, this does NOT work!"
730,handy little tools for working on electronics.
731,We've had these headphones for about 8 years until the kids finally finished them off when trying them.These headphones are great for using in gym. They designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you're jogging.The sound quality is simply amazing for their price. The design looks sort of dated but that's because they've been produced without change for more then 25 years now.I've bought the same model now to replace the broken once.Highly recommend.
732,"Huge disappointment.  These earphones do not stay in the ear while exercising.  It's not like I am doing anything enormously strenuous either, just simple walking or the occasional elliptical session.  I'm constantly having to adjust the phones so they stay put, but they never do.  Maybe I have misshapen ears, but these are terrible."
733,"I want to and should be able to love this trackball: right size, right feel (though the scroll ring feels coarse and cheap), right usability, excellent tactility, great software.But the deal-breaker on this trackball is its utterly lacking durability. I am on my 4th replacement from Kensington in a year now. In all cases, clockwise scroll ring rotation and primary button clicks became erratic. Kensington dutifully sent a replacement unit every time while under warranty, but now that warranty period is over and I again have a barely-usable device. Note that I'm not a gamer, nor have I subjected this device to any other ""hard"" usage.Kensington charges too much for something that is clearly not meant to last. I am now looking to Logitech and lesser-known ""ergonomic specialist"" brands for my trackball needs."
734,"Let's face it, the puny 128 mb players are expensive and worthless. That is why we are moving up to the bigger leagues. Well there has been big competitors trying to run the 20 gb market. Dell has one, rio has a nice smaller one than ipod, neuros, archos, and **Creative**. Now why did I stat Creative? First I will explain why I gave the ipod 2 stars.First off, I have two 20 GB MP3 Players. I have a Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3 (Same thing as the Zen) and a 20 GB Ipod.Good:Setup was simple and transferring files to the ipod was fast. It comes with a nice docking station and yes it is small.Bad:Let me uncover the truth about the ipod that no one knows about and that people never will say because they are now stuck with the pod like me. Apple will tell you I believe when you open the box that the pod is meant for your computer ONLY. That means you can't go over to a friend's house and copy your friends music. Ok well that isn't legal, but no matter what there are people who want to do that everyone knows that will happen, SO WHAT MOVE ON. So you are limited to only your PC. Now here is the tricky thing that no one even think of. Take my computer for example. I had the virus that spreaded across the net and I like to reformat my drive every year to give it that nice fresh start. ****Warning**** IF YOU REFORMAT A DRIVE OR ACTUALLY TRY TO INSTALL IPOD ON ANOTHER COMPUTER, EVERY SINGLE THING WILL BE ERASED!!!! That is what happened to my Ipod. See when you reformat a drive, you have to install the software over again because everything is erased off the computer. So when you reinstall it on your pc or a friend's pc, the ipod does not like when you try to copy so the software has a reset in it and will wipe out everything you have. I have 2,000 songs and 4 months of work (because I have other work to deal with) gone down the drain as if I never touched the d*** pod. Secondly, unless there is some way to change the settings, every cd burned, ipod makes a copy of each song in the library making you have to erase each copy which becomes extremely annoying because it makes a copy of it on your ipod which is so stupid. Unlike the creative, you can't change anything directly from the device, only on the computer which isn't good either.Now back to the Creative. I have the Jukebox 3 which is the SAME EXACT THING as the Zen. Zen has a different style so that is why it is called that. To prove it is the same, check the prices at Comp usa and other stores. They still sell my at the same price as the Zen. Plus all the firmware and accessories are made for both devices. The creative allows you to use it on anyone's computer and it is compatible with everything. Apple is known for having there products strictly work for them. The drastic windows change didn't change that much. Apple you are limited to there firewire and usb attachment and you must have every wire that comes with it or else you have to buy it again because you can't just go to a normal store and buy any usb or firewire because it won't fit your pod. Creative will work with anything. you can go out and purchase any cable for it.Next is the firmware. It comes with a simple easy to use program where you can see everything on your computer and see your device on the other screen. the scrolling is great and the sound quality is superb. You can choose some great accessories for it. I purchased a $68.00 FM Tuner with built in Microphone and mini display with the play, stop, fast forward, and rewind all on it. The biggest difference is the price of the Creative. It is $100 cheaper than the pod and it has more features and works well. Ipod has gotten so much publicity when I feel it shouldn't. Creative has been knocked down just because it isn't white and a couple inches smaller. Creative truly is better. It isn't as if I wanted to advertise it because i am a Creative fan because this is my first product I purchased from them besides the standard soundblaster built into Home PC's. I have both the Ipod and Creative Labs and I would take Creative over ipod any day. My mother went with the hype and bought the ipod and I took the Creative going with my instincts and a lot of reviews. Look who came out as the winner. I still have my songs and less of a headache. Don't make the same mistake like my mother."
735,"Sound quality is amazing. Noise reduction is pretty good too, can't hear anything once I have these bad boys on."
736,"[...]Great product and great price.  Not expensive and does the job.  I am always thwarted by 3'-6' cables.  This is a bit longer than I needed but worth it not to have the hassle with being ""almost long enough"".  Quick ship and didn't break the bank."
737,"These are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work. They're comfortable and block out external noise really well. Lifetime warranty to boot! They sound good - smooth, flat  and full - but are not ""audiophile"" quality. You could do a lot worse for a lot more jing! Stick with Koss, they know ""cans!"""
738,This protector/privacy guard is as advertised. I was able to use my laptop on the airplane without having to look over my shoulder. It does fall out very easy. I would recommend cleaning your table screen prior to installing. Use all of the plastic attachement pieces to secure yours. I have lost mine due to only using two and was always sliding back into place.
739,I utilize these tables as a patch cable for my pod-casting equipment. They worked as intended and seem to be the best price I could  find at the time.
740,Thin wiring and breaks easy. That is if you don't receive it already broken. I don't recommend it. I recommended buying one with a thicker cable.
741,"I bought this on seeing ""4 Star"" rating in Amazon.com. It was pretty good when I bought. Now I could not hear any sound from my right side headphone. Very disappointed on the quality from Sony. Be aware when buying this."
742,"I had problems with one of these units (left ear piece stopped working after a mere 15 minutes of use), but ultimately got a replacement and bought and additional one and both are fine. The ear pads are exceptionally comfortable, but the head piece is poorly designed and digs into your head above your ears. As for audio quality, well, you get what you pay for, but it's not too bad. Not audiophile, but great for use on a computer."
743,"Bought these to tie up the wiring in my truck's topper.  They DO NOT stick well (especially to rough/uneven surfaces), ended up having to glue them so they would stick. :-("
744,"This speaker wire must have been designed for a particular purpose, but I'm not sure what the exact purpose is. It is wide but there is extra insulator between the two wires so it is not thin enough to put against a wall or under a rug, flat ribbon wire would be needed for that. The width makes it difficult to turn some corners and remain flat, so it could fold along the vertical seam of a wall but not stay flat on a ceiling around a corner. Thin nails can be placed through the wide center insulator and it needs nailing at frequent intervals if you want it to stay flat stretched horizontally on a vertical surface. And the wire has so many strands like hair it is impossible to twist without flaring at the end, maybe it needs to be tinned.I used about 70 ft for my project, which was outdoors but mostly not exposed to UV. I couldn't find any information about suitability for outdoor use, probably not UV resistant. There is still an enormous heavy spool on the shelf in the garage for future projects. If you measure a wiring project beforehand and only buy enough wire you will always be 4 feet short, so there is a temptation to buy extra. So you buy extra, and in this case your heirs will have to figure a use for it.I think this wire was priced much lower in the past, not sure it is such a bargain now."
745,"Not a whole lot to say here. Bought an electronics accessory, it does its job. Construction is solid, sound quality is good. Well done.UPDATE: After only a few uses over the course of about a year, the soldered connections are beginning to give out and sound quality can be pretty bad. You have to play the fidgeting with the wire game all the time, which is really annoying. I usually like Belkin for these type of things, so maybe I just got a bad one. But be wary!"
746,I used this on my canon rebel t3i and it was very good  for the pictures i took at sandy beach on a sunny cloudless day
747,"I got this keyboard because it was recommended, particularly by people who have pain in their shoulder from having the mouse too far away.  What's nice is there's no number keypad on the side... it enables the mouse to be much closer to the keyboard (and therefore my body).  This combined with a few other ergonomic changes have made the pain go away.That said, there's one minor downside and one major downside. The minor one is that for me is that it takes a little more effort to press down on the keys than I'm used to - so sometimes my fingers get tired from typing so much.  To be fair though, I'm on the computer 12 hours a day - so for the average computer user, it probably isn't an issue.After using it for a year, one MAJOR downside is that the little plastic things underneath the keys keep breaking. At least once a month it seems a key stops working, so I have to take off the key, stick some tissue paper inside the key, put it back on, and then it works again.There's clearly a serious quality control issue with the keys on these keyboards.Final Take:Definitely recommended for anybody who needs to get rid of the number keys to bring the mouse closer to their keyboard. Just be sure you know how to remove and replace keys."
748,"If you are a sophisticated Windows user such as myself and are using one of its x64 Editions, you will be disappointed to know that as of the time of this review, no drivers are available either online or offline to get this product to work with Windows x64 Editions. Users have been requesting Hauppauge for these drivers for over a year now, but apparently this isn't a priority for Hauppauge. A call to Hauppauge indicated that they will be available no sooner than late summer 2006, although in reality I would not be surprised if that is delayed to early 2007 instead.Of course, there are alternatives such as the PowerColor Theater 550 Pro that support the x64 Editions right now."
749,"Pros:Good selection of toolsSturdy (for the price at least)CheapCons:None, really, except for the fact that the plastic parts are a bit cheap."
750,"I think this is a simple case of deciding what you want.  The Aiptek camera tries to cater to consumers that don't know what they want.  Its an adequate webcam, an adequate take anywhere digital camera for very small photos or large web pictures for your website or online auctions, and an adequate camera for taking small movies.  But with that said, the camera does not excel in any areas.-Webcam-  the actual quality is very nice when compared to some other usb webcams (but it is more expensive) and it can be powered by the USB connection.  But there are some problems with Yahoo Messenger, so if you want to use Yahoo with this webcam, beware, there may be some minor hiccups.  It comes with a decent stand, but the base sometimes will give way to the rigidity of the USB cord and will tend to pull the camera over.  The webmovies are almost unusable.  Apparently this camera uses some kind of little used codec that most people don't have unless they have the aiptek software... so don't count on sharing small webmovies with other people.Like all cameras of this sort, low light is its mortal enemy.-Digital camera- the camera MSRP is about $80.  There are some cheap sub $100 cameras that are 2 megapixels.  I know I personally saw a 3 megapixel camera from kodak for $100.  So is it really worth it to buy this camera for 1.2 megapixel resolution?  On the plus side, the camera does offer a macro mode which I have used to varying success for taking pictures for online auctions and this camera does have the advantage of being very small (if you are a spy or something?).  Also I found the memory adequate if not robust.  In all probability you will not be taking many pictures with this camera anyways.-Battery Life-  If this is mainly a webcam, the battery life really doesn't matter since it is powered by USB.  But if you use this for a camera I found that the camera will last a few days of sporadic phototaking.  Purchase of rechargable batteries are recommended.Summary- My recommendation is to know what you want.  Do you want a webcam or a small digital camera?  If you MUST have both and you can't afford to spend a little extra to buy both, then the Aiptek camera is an adequate compromise."
751,Used these to swap out the spade lugs which were incompatible with my son's Onkyo TX8050. Kudos to Monster for allowing me to re-use 15 year old cables. Better for the environment and my wallet.
752,"I was looking for a non-slip headphone to wear while jogging.  Reading some of the reviews, this seemed like a good and inexpensive product.  However, one week into the use, I find this headphone to be poorly designed.  The grip does not fit well over my ears and the headphones stay outside of the ear canal.  Also, the sound is directed towards the front.  So, I will have to raise the volume to hear the sound.  The sound can be heard by those standing next to me.The headphones also gave me constant shocks when I used it with my laptop, although this did not happen when I used it with the MP3 player.  The sound quality is great.  But I am discarding this headphone for reasons stated above."
753,"I first tried these headphones in the base exchange while I was stationed in Germany during my tour in the service.  I compared them to a dozen brands they had, including full ear ""professional"" sets like AKG and Sennheiser. As mentioned previously, these have the most incredibly tight and full bass. The tweeters put out crisp, clear highs -- especially brass. I bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day I accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones. I sent it back to the factory with $5.00 shipping and had them back, good as new in less than 2 weeks. The earphone mounting design, while comfortable, is not very sturdy. The earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course.  Well, I broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so I sent them to the factory with $5.00 and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly, good as new.  Bottom line, when Koss says ""Lifetime Warranty""...they mean it.  I still have them, actually I'm on my third set now and if these wear out, I'll buy them again. Oh, and did I mention they sound great too!"
754,"I bought these cases, and when I received them, 6 of them were broken.  I dont buy blank cases too often, but I have bought delicate things before, and this is the first and only item I have received from Amazon that did.  In all, Im not disappointed, I looked at other reviews and a few of them said the same thing and I thought it wouldnt happen to me.  As for the ease of opening, I have not had that problem.  They open easily and close securely for me."
755,This merchant worked with me until I was satisfied.  I am happy to say that the product received is an Apple and works perfectly.
756,Not the amount of bytes I had in mind but it works and I have not had any problems with it.
757,"wish it had I.S. but besides that it's a good lense, Pretty slow  focusing at very short range probably because i dont have very steady hands, which is also why i wish it had image stabilization, but if you have steady hands I wouldn't worry about it. i tend to manually focus at that point, besides that its pretty quick and works well."
758,"I was using this with a linux laptop and for some reason it was interfering with the keyboard at start up. I purchased this to use with my raspberry pi but also purchased a sainsmart expansion board that added to the usb count and powered the unit. I thought my laptop was fried and never thought the hub could be the problem, unplugged everything and the laptop worked fine. I haven't used this with windows."
759,No problem.  Works great and is as good as anything in the local stores.  I buy most everything on line.
760,"It fit's and works as a polarizer should. This company has been making filters for a long, long, long, time."
761,"I use it in conjunction with the Canon FADC58C 58mm filter adapter for my Canon G1X.  It works just as advertised.  Great for using when shooting water scenes or around shiny, non-metallic objects."
762,"First of all, I was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness. Anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before. Depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but that's it. Sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel. As long as Sony makes these I doubt I will buy another brand/model."
763,"this battery provides a good amount of power considering its rather small size. however, when being charged, the battery produces an easily audible whine. At least you'll know it's done charging once the whining noise is gone."
764,"I chose this Netgear product over other brands simply because in the past, Netgear products have always worked flawlessly. Nowadays however, Netgear's routers seem to be degrading in quality and the WGR614 is no exception. I recently purchased a version 5 and while it is good for basic routing, any complex addition to a network will cause this router to malfunction (e.g. adding a network printer).I've talked to tech support over 2 days and the only solution they can give me is that my network printer is at fault however as soon as I tried using a Linksys WRT54G, my network works as expected.If all you need is to route a couple computers together with no extra features, this product should suffice. Otherwise, look elsewhere, especially the Linksys products."
765,"Great durable headphones.  The weight felt heavy for a while but my neck became accustomed to it after a few days and now I  barely notice it.  Has good built in sound dampening and great sound.  I would give five stars if it came packaged with a quality adapter for use with a small headphone jack, generic adapters don't work great and will cause static and sound loss when barely touched."
766,I got this to use with a Astronomy Technology 66mm aperture  refractor for terrestrial viewing. The first I sent back as the hole for the tightening screw was too big so it could not be secured in place on my scope. The replacement is fine. There are better optics out there but this item is fine for the price.
767,"I just use this for my amplifier on guitars and ukuleles.  guess what...it's ideal.  Comfortable, quiet for others, true sounds reproduction.  I've worn it for, oh, maybe an hour straight, and it's big enough to be comfortable on my ears. It has no funny hissing or such.I am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers.  Sometimes too much tech knowledge can be a hindrance to good judgement  I, personalty, just wanted a middle priced quality headphone specifically for my amplifier for my high end guitars and ukuleles.  This is wonderful.  Love it.  Wish I could kiss it.  I think I will."
768,I love the kit. The only thing I wish it included was the &#34;third hand&#34; to assist in soldering. Other than that the kit is great!
769,"There is nothing outstanding about this cable.  It works fine, but still it is just a cable.  I would expect it to work."
770,"I wanted to see Mars and a good look at the rings of Saturn. I bought this hoping I could. However, the make and aperature of the telescope you have makes or breaks this lens. It is not a magical looking glass. It did magnify Mars.. so I was able to see a larger white light. I have a Celestron telescope.. but a low end."
771,"I realize there's a learning curve involved but here are a few thoughts on the Garmin V (my first GPS).So far it's a good compass and speedometer, but it thought I was on a parallel road to the freeway for a half-hour during my test trip this morning.  Maybe the accuracy level can be set somehow but between the six manuals that come with the system haven't stumbled upon this item yet.The 4 street maps I downloaded from the CD disappeared when I changed batteries.  Warning! Make sure your unit runs out of juice while you're in your car (while running) and the unit still plugged into the lighter. This is the only way to avoid re-downloading maps.It takes forever to punch in letters/numbers under &quot;find.&quot; You can't delete elevation numbers (no delete button)The backlight goes off, but hopefully stays on when dark.I'm sure a lot of my complaint is due to my own impatience, but this attribute is what gets me lost in the first place!  GPS should be designed for stressed people with a short attention span."
772,"The construction of this filter is very acceptable, not B+W league but close. The performance is also great with no color cast perceptible. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable polarizer."
773,"I purchased this Antenna to receive conservative talk radio that I thought I wasn't receiving, it turned out I was on the wrong frequency. I live in a rural area and I thought it was due to signal strength.My radio does not have a plugin to boost the AM signal, but the instructions say that you can place it along side the radio and it will work also. To be honest I couldn't tell the difference on any stations so I returned the unit for a full refund. I figured since it was a high price unit it would work better than it did.Unit has a tuner at the bottom center that allows you to fine tune the channel in. I give it a 3 star because it wasn't anything special and seem to me that it was over priced. It may work for someone else better, possibly if they have a plug on their radio for AM."
774,"i wanted the best earbuds to go with my new muvo. it was either gonna be sony or sennheiser. i own the senn hd575 and love them. so i bought the mx500 thinking they would give the best bang-for-the-buck, considering the sonys go as high as $$$.the bass is definately there but not as powerful as i expected. i tested them with a thx bass soundclip. i can barely hear anything below 100hz (possibly due to my bad hearing).a friend got the sony 828 for under $$$ a couple days ago. seriously, neither of us could tell the difference between the two. so he's happy and i'm not too thrilled. go for the senns if you like the volume control and color."
775,best headphones on earth. i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room. xD the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct. it really had made me fall deeper in love with music.
776,"I've used this drive with DVD X Copy Xpress, and it worked beautifully. The big problem I am having is adding data do a previously recorded CD-R. Before I had this installed, I could add files to folders in a CD-R using the click-and-drop function in My Computer (Windows XP). Now the Sony drive is not allowing me to do that -- it says the CD is not recordable (which is not true, since I could do that using another computer). I tried using their software, and it worked when I changed the root of the target CD, including the folder name.  However, if the folder had a two word name (with a space in between), I had the same problem. I deleted ALL the recording software I had installed, inclding Copy Xpress, and still it doesn't work. It's been very frustrating (since I have a constant need to add data to CDs). Guess I will have to reinstall my old CD burner, and use the Sony drive for DVDs only. What a pain.  Can anybody help?"
777,This is a great little kit. It has everything you need for most types of computer repair as well as upgrading components. All of the components have been demagnetized which is nice. A good value for the price!
778,"The balance/level bubbles would be awesome if they were plumb with tripod. Needs a book under one leg to get it level. Forget using the telescoping feature, it just throws the lean even farther off. The 2nd week using, one leg broke (pulled out when extending it) I was definitely pampering this poor thing, not yanking legs out with any excessive force. I was trying to milk its use out as long as I could.Bought the heavy duty Gorilla tripod and found it much more flexible and reliable."
779,"This camera fits in the palm of my hand.  My fault: I didn't check the dimensions before ordering.  This camera is way too small to even be seen.  I pointed it out to my neighbor and he said ""Where? Where is it? I don't see it.""  I was shocked at how small it is as the photos of it make it look like it's about 12"" long when it's really about 4 or 5 inches long.  Disappointed!"
780,"I don't use filters much at all, but this circular polarizer works fairly well in removing unwanted reflections.  You get what you pay for.  This is not a bad filter, but hardly the best one out there."
781,"If you work on static sensitive electronics then you will need to have one of these.  It dissipates static electricity while you are working on electronics.  This is a must have tool for you if you build computers.  Motherboards, CPU's, GPU's, SSD's, disk drives, memory sticks, etc. are all susceptible to damage from static electricity.  You can wipe out a $600 CPU before you even plug it in the socket!You put this onto your wrist and attach it to the metal chassis of the item you are working on.  They are a pain to wear but they do have a self-coiling cord to give you some flexibility.  You can adjust it to fit your wrist for comfort.I own a couple of brands of these and there is one I like better than this one for the comfort factor.  For under $8.00 this is still good insurance for handling those expensive computer components!"
782,"Buy a Linksys router instead!  The D-Link product concept is good. A wireless router with a print server built in. I can hard wire my PC for broadband at my desk, as well as use my laptop anywhere in or outside the house . With this set up, I can surf the net with both computers at the same time with one internet connection. The plus is that I can also use the printer with both computers. The problem is that I have been unable to connect to the internet with this router! Tech support is clueless as to the problem. I have spent several days on the phone trying different scenerios without luck.The concept is great, but the equiptment is useless.Buy LINKSY, great equiptment, ran flawlessly and great tech support."
783,"I enjoyed their sound while they lasted, but a weird thing happened to them: the rubber coating on the cord (the part between the two earbuds that goes behind your neck) started splitting into ribbons and breaking off. It's not like I was abusing it, I don't understand what happened to it. Since then, I've been using a sennheiser cx300-b which has been great."
784,"I had a sony clie and a Palm a while back and both didn't last me very long. The Palm lasted me only one year before the screen went totally black. The sony clie lasted me two years before it had a total melt down.Provided that I do had a tendance to wham a stylus down on the touch screen really hard... well what can I say, I'm a strong women. I don't know my strength.  So in result of of these two product malfunctioning at an early state, I stopped buy all sony and Palm PDA's. I just hope this apple Itouch can with stand my ""Super"" strength for the next five years. ;) And wont melt down before seven years are up. Beware - Treat your sony clie and Palm like a porceline china."
785,"I got this on Amazon One Day Sale event...These are great headphones, and in general great electronic equipment, reminding me of the Great SONY of the 80s, when they were making everything with great quality and absolute attention to details. The plastic is solid, the cables are soft and not sticky, the jacks are smooth, the inner steel spring is high quality and elastic and it has small marks to click and lock the headphones opening, L and R marks are different color and glued perfectly on their designated spots :), etc etc. small details, that are indication of how well a product was designed and made. These headphones are such a perfect product.I have very large head - for example, all my life I cannot find sunglasses wide enough to fit me. These headphones are elastic to stay firm, and open enough to fit me without causing any discomfort for several hours. Yesterday I used them non stop for 3 hours - they are not irritating, not heating, not making my ears sweat, etc. I don't think they are tight at all, as some other reviewers mentioned.The cord is long - definitely too long for portable/gym use. These are meant to be used in static condition, in a studio/room/desktop situation. Sitting in a rolling chair, one can move, turn, spin, without needing to take them off.Sound fidelity - great. These are sounding great, not colored, sensitive without pre-amp need. On par with everything that is not pro level and costs up to $300. Definitely worth the money.p.p. I have owned and used probably around 200 headphones, listening from vinyls, pro level studio magnetic rolls / those 64-track ones :) /, micro cassettes, CDs, Laser Disks, all kinds of computer format audio, so I know about electronics. These V-6 are worth the money."
786,Amazon was wrong as it said that this would fit my Ford Focus 2005 Zx4. The site was wrong. When I got it I almost thought it was a joke. It is about an inch too short. If it fits your car it would be nice.
787,"Owned for 6 months.  Good customer support until they agreed I needed an RMA # and then they stopped talking to me.  Had to tweak them twice to get it.  Received new unit after three weeks.Good sound and volume if encoded at higher rates.  The 128MB expandability is good especially since the cards are finally getting cheaper.Not for the heavy exerciser who sweats a lot.  The clip is almost useless except for walkers.  When held in hand or against the skin the sweat gets into the player and shorts it.Good survivability.  Dropped a couple of times with no subsequent problem.  One potential problem is the battery cover.  It is flimsy and does not stay on the player when changing the battery.  There is a good chance of losing it, especially when dropping it because it flies off.The software is kludgy.  It has a tendency of locking up my computer.  There are some directories that were created by mistake that I can't get rid of.  The good part about it is that it encodes MP3s and WMAs very quickly."
788,"These headphones are fine for the average joe, but are a nightmare for the audiophile. The frequency range is small, and focuses on the bass. this is pretty bad for those who listen to the fast paced power metal, where the guitars are going off into the super high-pitched notes. These dumb down the sound and do not feel like they ""hug"" your ears. They should be sending a pure, surrounding sound that gives birth to all frequencies, instead of muffling them. after all, they are supposed to be monitors. they should atleast be able to provide a clearer sound. i am dissapointed."
789,"It does a good job.  It is a bit difficult to put on and take off.  There is no reference mark so user can cell the position it is is.  This works a bit different than the old traditional Polarizer Lense that was rotated to create polarizer effect and was more visable through the view finder.  No instructions came with the filter.  I assumed I knew how to use one, but these for Digital are different.  I am sure it will be great when I get acclimated to using it."
790,"Got the cable on time and at a great price. Had an issue I have had with these types of cables before - one of the pins was out of alignment. I have learned over the years to always push gently to connect - never force. When it would not slide into a place, a quick inspection yielded an answer to the problem. After straightening the errant pin, it connected nicely and has continued to after numerous connect/disconnects as I dock and undock my notebook. If I had no pin problems, it would have been five instread of four stars."
791,"I'm a headphone nut and have $600 worth of high-end headphones lying around (three pair).  I also have a pair of Koss Portapro2s, which are identical to the Portapro other than lacking part of the adjustment mechanism.Despite all this high end audio goodness around, I still use and enjoy the Portapros.  They offer maybe 60% of what my other headphones have, for 1/5th the price (and are much more portable, of course).  I've owned and enjoyed several pair over the years including the Radio Shack iterations, and have always been wowed by the sound quality.  They were my introduction to ""better than stock earbud"" sound.I think they would be a better deal at $20-$25, but they are still worth the money at close to $50.  The bass can get a bit overbearing at times (I'm no basshead), but otherwise they are excellent.  Also, note that they are completely open, and perhaps not the best choice for noisy environments like on a plane or bus."
792,"I ordered the Fellowes Custom Mail Order Keyguard Keyboard Seal/Skin twice, once for myDell DJ741 Bluetooth Keyboardand once for myDell Bluetooth Keyboard.I should caution you that it can take a couple of months (or more) for your custom keyboard skin to be delivered -- IF it gets delivered at all. It took almost three months (!) before my first custom mail order keyboard skin finally arrived in the mail. And when it did, I was ecstatic! My second mail order, however, was a washout - it turned out that my Dell Bluetooth Keyboard wasn't supported. And, hey, it took the good people at Fellowes only two months to notify me of the problem (Amazon promptly gave me a refund after I notified them of the problem).Here's how the mail order process works:After you have placed an order with Amazon, you will be mailed a Fellowes Keyguard Keyboard Seal/Skin Mail Order Form that you have to fill out and mail back to Fellowes. You will be asked to fill out the model number of your keyboard, the number of keys on it (104 for a standard keyboard, for example), and of course, your name and delivery address. Next, keep your fingers crossed that (1) your keyboard is supported, (2) your keyboard skin will arrive before a catastrophic spill ruins your keyboard, and (3) you'll be promptly notified if your keyboard isn't supported.---The silicone skin is very thin and doesn't interfere with typing - it feels almost as if the skin isn't even there. If you don't mind the lengthy wait (minus 1 star), this skin works very well for protecting your keyboard from dust and spills."
793,"...because aren't stamped with the Belkin mark (in fact I bought two at the same time from these folks, and they even look different- one's shiny and the other is dull... looks like they were just grabbed out of the nearest import box of the day) and they don't work, at least for critical applications.I'm using these in a high speed monitor extender system that specifies Cat5e up to 200 feet.  These 100' cables make the system unacceptably noisy whereas other cables I have work perfectly.  My guess is that these aren't really Belkin at all, but cheap imitations instead- if they are, shame on Belkin- they look exactly like china made junk cables that have little or no twists in their inner pairs.  I actually cut a cheap import cable open- that was advertised to be cat5e- and found that there were only 1-2 twists per FOOT on the inner conductors, where Cat5e spec says there should be 10 twists per INCH.  I didn't cut one of these apart because I'm returning them, but my guess is I'd find the same.  Unless you're using these in a ""slow don't really care"" system, stay away, or be annoyed...UGH. Time to just buy some decent Belden cable and make my own stupid cables...."
794,I am 60 years old.  I have owned a lot of headphones.  Years ago you had to pay a lot to get a descent set. As the products got better you have ear buds that sound incredible and you can buy a cheap set of headphones for 6 dollars that sound really good but there overall range is limited and they are not very comfortable to wear.  I have owned Sennheiser wireless headphones that I paid 120 dollars for and I don't remember anything that sounds as good as these and are as comfortable to wear.  As far as I am concerned anybody who can't appreciate the quality of these headphones for 3 times the price is just being picky.  I would recommend these Koss UR-20 to anybody.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT DEAL!!!
795,"Some have commented that the microphone is disabled when switching to speaker mode. If the mic needs to stay live, just plug it directly to the sound card rather than using the mic portion of this switch."
796,"This Product Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones, is excelent, sounds great and it,s very affordable for the price that I paid for it, I recommend it very much."
797,"Perhaps because it contains both keyboard and mouse connectors, my computer does not recognize the keyboard at boot.  At any rate, didn't work for me."
798,"Maybe this product is terrific at what it does, once configured.  My experience with Belkin tech support, the documentation, and the firmware was very, very bad.  After 24 hours of frustration, I finally returned the WAP.  Then I spent an hour recovering my original configuration.Note that if you are trying to use this device as a range extender, you will probably be interested in the Super Secret ""range extender quick start guide"" on the Belkin support web site.  It's not included in the box.My impression is that engineering designed a good product, tested it in very narrow circumstances, then told the tech writers what to write down.  Clearly no one tested the documentation."
799,"These headphones are reasonably comfortable, though if you wear eyeglasses you might find them pressing your glasses against the side of your head in an eventually painful way.The sound quality is mediocre.  Music seems too dead, lacking vibrance.  Even Sony's basic $10 comes-with-the-walkman headphones sound better than these.Overall, these are probably fine for background music whilst working, but if you want to really listen and pay attention to the music, try something else."
800,"Sorry I ever laid eyes on this turkey!Absolutely could NOT get it to work, so I stuck it on EBay.Person who bought it asked for a refund...She couldn't make it work, either!Don't waste your time or money, buy a Logitech Harmony instead!"
801,"I havent' rec'd the wire yet so this is holding up hooking up the speaker system thus having a fully operational tv system. this isn't that huge an order;  50', so i don't know why the hold up on shipping?  they advertised 3-4 day normal ship time and it's now going on 8 days & i am told it may not get here until the 15th!  that's 2 weeks not 3-4 days. my huge stereo cabinet was here in 3 days, the speakers, receiver all here in 2 days - why this is taking so long is beyond me. keep that in mind when ordering as it could potentially hold everything up for you :(Can't attest to quality as I don't have the item yet!"
802,"This controlled my older TV and VCR, but would not work my newer Toshiba DVD writer D-RW2.  I tried all the codes they suggested, then scanned thru all the codes a couple times before giving up.  Otherwise, I like the feel and operation of the unit."
803,"IntroductionSome time ago, I was browsing a few of my favorite sites when I came across a deal for two pairs of the MX400 earbuds. The price was right and given my lack of quality earbuds, I decided to jump on this deal, if only to have a decent pair of earbuds I can use to listen to my music at times where isolation from the surrounding environment is not quite ideal. When I received them after a few days, I began burning them in as per my usual, listening to them intermittently throughout the process. What I heard was actually quite surprising.Design and Build QualityConstructed entirely of plastic, the housings of the MX400 don't exactly inspire confidence and feel rather cheap to the touch. The plastic cabling is quite tangle-prone and isn't quite as soft or flexible as I would've liked and terminates in a nickel-plated 3.5mm straight jack. As a whole, the MX400s don't seem like they would be able to stand up to a great deal of abuse and should be toted around in a case, if at all possible.Sound QualityAs I said from the start, I was more or less expecting decent quality from the MX400s; nothing spectacular nor particularly bad. What I did not expect was to be blown away by the sound of the MX400s but, here I am. These are, quite easily, the best sounding earbuds I've ever heard and to explain why, I'll start at the bottom.The way the MX400s present bass is very polite and controlled. It's punchy enough to make itself known when it needs to be and never rises up unnecessarily. Speed is certainly a strong suit of the MX400s and can come and go quite easily. Perhaps that is the Achilles' heel of the low end presentation because it doesn't seem to have realistic levels of decay and once bass has hit, it seems to disappear just as quickly. These can definitely be described as bass light overall but that can be augmented with a warm sounding amp or even a cheap Fiio E3.The midrange brings to the table nice detail and transparency. Vocals take center stage in the presentation, seeming to sit in front of the instruments. Treble is very smooth and somewhat laid back, lacking the type of sparkle and crispness that I've grown to enjoy from IEMs such as the RE0.The soundstage is what wowed me the most about the MX400s. Both width and depth are very impressive and created an ""out of head"" feeling, as if the music was coming at me from outside of the earbuds themselves. Due to the large soundstage, the MX400s are adept at presenting distance between instruments, and good at spatial positioning within the soundscape. The best aspect of the soundstage is that it's large without being too large. I never got the sense that I was disconnected from the music; on the contrary, the MX400s were surprisingly intimate with most tracks.I did find that there's noticeable graininess and dryness throughout the presentation. This is perhaps the biggest flaw of the MX400s. Notes are harder and edgier than I prefer and while this may be a bit of a drawback to me, some users may enjoy this for certain Hard Rock or Metal tracks. In addition to this graininess, the MX400s have a somewhat cold, almost analytical, sound about them which is decently resolving but not the most natural or ""musical"" sounding.ConclusionThe MX400s are the best purchase I've ever made in terms of earbuds, blowing all of the other earbuds I've tried (which isn't much, admittedly) out of the water. Sure, these have their flaws but given my relatively low expectations, I'm very pleased with these earbuds. Considering that these are several years old and have since been replaced by the slightly higher end MX580s and Sennheiser's new ""Expression"" line of earbuds, I'm confident that sound quality will only improve as you move up the ladder. Personally, I'm more of a fan of IEMs than earbuds for a number of reasons but if I were currently in the market for a new pair of earbuds, I'd definitely start with Sennheiser's.Nonetheless, the MX400s have delivered on everything I wanted them to. They sound better than decent, were extremely cheap and I don't have to worry about babying them too much. The MX400s can be found online for cheap and I can definitely recommend them to people who need a cheap knock around pair of earbuds."
804,"I actually own the model above these, but I figured I'd post a review for these as well because they're pretty much the same thing except for a connector piece in the middle that is actually more of a problem than anything.I have had these headphones for about 9 months now and I really LOVED them until last week.  Extremely comfortable, compact, and great sound.  Unfortunately, they recently started acting up.  My left headphone dropped it's volume level about 75%.  For all intents and purposes it's dead, and it's driving me nuts listening to headphones with one side not working.  The interesting thing is when I started asking people I know who have them, I found that 4 of the 4 people I asked have had problems with them.  My friend who initially reccommended these headphones to me said after 6 months the bass dropped out entirely in one ear in his and he can no longer use them.  Today I got a call from my sister (who I bought a pair for as a gift because I loved mine so much) who said one of earplugs is entirely dead.  She's only had hers for about 6 months.  Another friend bought a pair and they were dead 3 DAYS after buying them!  Sony did replace his pair, but not without a LOT of hassles first.  They also tried to send a MUCH cheaper model to replace the original set.So my reccommendation is, These headphones are great when they work, but I paid $50 for mine, which I thought was worth the money until they broke.  But if I'm going to spend that much on headphones, I want them to last more than 6-9 months!Also... be weary of the silicone ear peices. They can fall off easily and if you loose them, they are expensive to replace.Update - Jan 2010.  The price of these headphones dropped to about $14 bucks (in August of 09) and have made some improvements to the product, so I decided to try another pair because at that price I figured it was worth it.  I unfortunately crimped a wire (my own fault) and one side is dead so I've been waiting for the price to drop back down near $14 so I can buy another pair.  I just thought it was interesting that, since august of '09 (now Jan of '10) the price has steadily increased and it's now over $30.  At $14 a pair, they're worth it, but anything above $20, I wouldn't bother.  Either wait and see if the price drops again, or buy something else."
805,This cable works fine as long as you get it in just right. It seems a little loose.
806,"I'm always trying new headphones, I've owned everything from Coby,Grado to Dr Dre's. Well this is another pair to throw in my headphone drawer. They sound like twenty five dollar headphone! better than some not as good as others. The thing that sets them apart from others in the price range is after you wear them for a short period of time, twenty five minutes or so your ears get unbearably hot,which is annoying and uncomfortable. I gave them a shot and now they are exiled to my file drawer with the other disappointments like the Sennheiser HD 20's and the Skullcandy lowrider camo. (Skullcandy in ear headphones are great sounding). Invest your money in something else other than these sauna cans."
807,"...otherwise, stay away. The vertical swivel lock does not lock tight and there is no detent for horizontal. Your camera can, at best, point slightly up or slightly down. Monumental design flaw.Useless."
808,"If you are reading this, you want to know if it is stereo and works at the price.  And the answer is yes"
809,"Having used this CP880 for about 2+ yrs, I've still on the learning curve and have only scratched the surface . Although most shots are quite good with the Auto sequence, it's nice to have flexibility with manual settings. Be prepared to buy the extras to make your digicam experience practical: 2 re-chargeable Li-ion batteries and the charger; upgrade to a 64 or better yet a 128 MB CF card with card reader (supplied with my Lexar 64 MB CF card. USB connectivity reader greatly expedites transfer of files to PC); optional digital wallet (Minds@work 3 GB portable HD for travel and downloading on the road); belt case (to keep the CP close by for those ""once in a lifetime shots""). I'm familiar with many controls but the manual is a bit cumbersome. I'm now reviewing ""Nikon Coolpix 880 Photography by Dan Curtin...to pick up more nuances. The CP4300 may be a more current version and deserves consideration. All in all, a great camera. My 1200 shots taken in Oregon,Washington,Vancouver, and Victoria were burned to CD's with relative ease thanks to my CP880 and peripherals. Some of my Butchart Gardens shots were spectacularly polarized courtesy of a hand-held 52 mm polarizing lense from my old 35 mm Nikorrmat!!"
810,"I have had a set of the Acoustimass series speakers since the early nineties.  At the time I thought they were some of the best speakers I ever had, why?  Because I was told they were by marketing.  I still have them and they have performed well and have lasted a long time and I expect they will  last for years to come.  If you use them in a surround sound application they are ok.  But if you use them for audio only they are lacking in mid bass and low bass is virtually non existent.  The sub is non powered as has been stated in other reviews and that's the problem.  I have tried positioning what they call a sub in various ways and get the same results in every application.However if you add a powered sub, as I have, they are good speakers and will perform 100% better.  I paid $750.00 on sale at the time.  I see now they have come down in price quite a bit.  The bottom line, if you want a system that requires little space and use it for movie watching they are fine, but if you want to enjoy your music I would suggest searching for a set of speakers that are more conducive to listening to music.  The Kenwood 777 and 999's I had at one time were far better speakers for listening to music, but I got rid of those when I purchased the Bose.  I wish I would have waited a bit before I got rid of them but I thought I was upgrading.  Little did I know I was down grading.The only reason I can get good quality sound out of the non powered version I have, and why I've kept them so long, is because I have quality stereo components to include EQ, processor and reverb, so I can make these speakers sound like they're JBL concert series speakers.  But without a quality system to run them, I would pass personallyAs an FYI I got the bose center channel speaker and rear surround sounds to compliment these speakers.  Like I said, in this application they are as good as I've heard with the system I have.  I will also say that as far as music listening goes, it will depend on the style of music you listen to.  If you like classical style music for example they couldn't be better as they deliver instrument separation very well.  But if you like country or rock you will need a system like mine to drive them, and that's when they're at their best.  I gave them 3 stars simply because they require too much assistance in delivering what they are capable of."
811,"Dec 12, 2011: Initially I liked the printer very much (see below)...BUT it is now 4 months old and will not print correctly (missing colors, missing text/numbers, lines across photos etc etc).  I have replaced cartridges more than once, and aligned/cleaned printhead more than once.  It's no help.  Kodak supposedly is ending me a new printhead under warranty in a few days.  In meantime, I will be looking at other brands of printer.---Sept 1, 2011: Having been an HP OfficeJet All In One printer user for more than a dozen years, I was somewhat reluctant to leave the HP world and try another brand, but am very glad I did.  The Kodak 6150 is easy to set up and use, a bit noisier than the HP but seems just as fast, and print quality is more than acceptable.  Am looking forward to the lesser print costs that Consumer Reports found in its recent article.  I use the printer with a USB cable, so can't comment on wireless mode."
812,"The initial results were excellent, but I must admit I was a little surprised to see how long the lens becomes when at maximum focal length.  The weight also intimidated me at first, but when mounted on a Canon Digital Rebel XTi with a battery grip attached, it seems to balance out decently.I do have to say that, in accordance with other reviews, low light is not a friend of this lens.  I haven't done much outdoor photography (due to time contraints, time of the year, etc.), but what I've done has turned out very clear and pleasing.  I have a feeling that well-lit outdoor shots is where this lens might excel best.This is definitely a massive upgrade over the kit lens (in focal length, size, weight, and quality), so be prepared for all four.I'm not sure if the price justified the purchase, but I think that if good care is taken of this lens, then over time it will surely pay itself off.Do I recommend?  Only if you find the Digital Rebel kit lens too limiting, and want that extra focal length, if you don't mind the extra size, if you have a need for the extra zoom, and are ready for upgrading.  Otherwise, practice on the kit lens or a cheaper lens for a while before moving up."
813,Not very well built. The plastic is very flimsy- but I guess I'll live with it. I'll look elsewhere for better product
814,"I bought these headphones so I could hear what I'm recording versus the volume of the performance.  I'm using them to record a variety tv show.  The Bistro is large, but the actual performance space is tight.  The PA system is ceiling mounted.  I'm running up to a four-camera shoot.  All of the audio is coming to my mixer from mics in the room and an audio feed off the board.  What I need most is isolation, so I can hear my mix versus the room sound.  The plastic cups around the drivers on this gear are INTENSE.  These headphones were recommended to me by two professional audio engineers.  They have a long reputation as the choice of radio broadcasters.  I expect them to perform, and they do.  So that's the plus, now here's the minus: The color is puke green.  Why, Koss?  It's 2009?  They don't come with an adapter to 1/8th inch mini jack.  Finally, I could not get them out of the box.  The box is a three-part affair.  The plastic sleeve was easy to remove.  Pulling the cardboard frame out of the paper box was IMPOSSIBLE.  Finally, I had to cut the paper box along one seam to get it off the cardboard frame in which the headphones are mounted.  The problem with this is you can't return them if the packaging is damaged, and getting them out of that packaging REQUIRES that you destroy it.  I find this kind of scenario dishonest. These headphones are known for their ability to last.  If they don't, I'm going to return them, and raise holy Hades with Koss, all because I had such a hard time getting them out of the box."
815,"I have been listening to headphones over the past 30 years or more. From AKG, Sony, B and O, Bose, Senheiser and among others (such as the overpriced Beats by Dr. Dre)  After listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality, price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point. For less than $50 including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to. With the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources. I don't abuse headphones so these will last me a long time."
816,Does not work with D3100.  Why do they advertise it as working with it?  Do not get this if you have a Nikon D3100
817,"This antenna works okay, but not that much better than an unamplified pair of $9 rabbit ears I've used. It does pull in the digital stations without the amount of ""moving around"" required to get the rabbit ears pointed in the right spot.One thing that did surprise me (no I guess I didn't read the dimensions); this is not low-profile; the unit is actually very large. In the end I couldn't use it on the TV I had it planned for as it was just too big to fit on top or behind the flat screen."
818,"The device is very flaky. It's incompatible with a lot of NICs of the leading manufactures (Intel, Realtek, Marvell). I have two PCs with Realtek network adapters and they both connect at maximum 100Mbit/s. On the other hand, my Lenova laptop and Iomega network HDD work just fine at 1000Mb/s.It's a well known problem that is not mentioned by NetGear in the unit description (and because of this I think they are cheating customers). Unfortunately, for me it's too late to return the device but you can save your money by choosing another switch/manufacturer. The compatibility problem is well discussed at Netgear official forum, for example here: [...] encourage you to read this forum BEFORE buying the switch."
819,"We had lotz of odd sized photos mainly from Picture People. It was really hard to find photo book for those.Pioneer Jumbo Magnetic Page X-Pando Album, is a great way to store and save the photos. It makes photos look good too."
820,"Pros:- Solid Construction, screwed right onto my t-ring with no difficulty.Cons:- Didn't work with my Celestron Starseeker 114 reflector telescope.  The focal point of the camera and the focal point of the scope were nowhere near each-other.Bottom Line:Celestron makes a different model (Model # 93640) that includes a 2x barlow lens that will allow the camera to focus on the image the telescope is seeing.  3 stars, mainly because they should have either included that in the box, or removed the 'universal' moniker."
821,again i have to say DO NOT BUY WIRES OF ANY KIND FROM AMAZON !I have no clue wtf it is but so far NO WIRE/S HAVE YET TO WORK .
822,It worked some of the time. I had to keep pushing the buttons on the infrared device until it changed the channels or cut the devices on.
823,"This ""Nikon 7072"" lens pen is a 100% replica of the item ""LensPEN Lens Cleaning System"" which is sold here on Amazon also.  It's so much the same that the general wording on the package and the plastic flashing on the product is 100% the same.  I would save yourself $2 and get the other one - they are clearly made by the exact same company."
824,"This antenna works, but no better than the ""in the box"" wire FM antenna that came with my receiver. On the third floor of my house I was barely receiving my favorite FM station and so bought this antenna to improve reception. It did not improve reception, even after trying multiple elevated positions."
825,"I bought this unit when it was advertised endlessly on the Art Bell show.  C Crane claimed exceptional AM reception (even though their website pushed an external AM antennae for this???), claimed the speaker bought out true lifelike sound of the human voice and took many many years to develop this dependable unique radio.  All claims are false.  First, I live in an open area just west of Minneapolis.  AM Reception for local AM stations was static or so picky that you would have to move the radio constantly.  I ran it on batteries and drove to different locations within 5 miles of my house.  Same problems.  I bought the external AM antennae, it cleared up a bit but not as advertised.  They claimed the speaker bought out lifelike human voice... it does not.  It's a standard speaker you could find at Radio Shack, no special bass/treble boost for clearer AM sound.  Finally, let's talk reliability.  I bought one unit for myself and one for my mother a week later.  After ONE YEAR, both units LCD displays became unrecognizable.  Certain bars of the lcd were unreadable and others were stuck.  It became impossible to locate a station by number.  I am furious and extremly disappointed with all the hype C Crane company placed on this product.  I do not trust them or any of their products."
826,"This company does not lose market share because of lack of interested buyers, willing to pay for American products.  They lose it because of lack of quality.  This is the sad conclusion I have reached after having owned and used several Koss headphones:Pro4AA, my father owned this in the 70s, and they always got the wow!!!s.SST10 They were just ok, well, the hinges broke within 2 weeks of use.PRO4XL They were good, until one channel decided to go mute... it was not the wires.  Sent them back to Koss for warranty repair.  They lost them, claiming they never got them, but after they cashed the check with the shipping and handling fee they required.  The check was in the same package as the headphones.A130 Replaced the lost PRO4XLs.  Amazing clarity, good basses, fantastic imaging, would forget I had them on (very comfortable); they did not have more than 150 hours of use when the sound became all distorted, never used at high volume levels.Pro4AAT, blah...  I got the PRO4AAT as a warranty replacement for the defective A130s, according to Koss, same class replacement.  They were tight on my head, even with the bands fully extended, had to flex the upper band to get acceptable fit; the head band does not feel right either.  As far as the sound... highs are good, mid range... bland, bass... think about listening to music coming from the other side of a thin wall, terrible...they sound muddy, lack clarity, lack dynamic range, very disappointing.Called Koss and explained my problem.  They offer to give me $50 towards the purchase of a more expensive set of headphones.  Saw the PRO4AA and thought they would be a good replacement for the PRO4AAT.  Koss offers to replace them as an even exchange.  Then I read the recent PRO4AA reviews.  In a few words, the PRO4AA are not even a shadow of the originals according to the reviewers.  What to do now?As far as a new buyer... my recommendation is... stay away from the PRO4AATs."
827,I have had this for about 3 weeks and already it has stopped working. You have to shake the cable or bend it to make it work. Dont buy it
828,"I will keep it simple folks! I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon!"
829,"Good quality, especially for the price.  However, as a newby photographer, I learned something... circular polarizers don't really work very well on ultra wide angle lens's... too much variation in color change across the viewing angle expanse.  Better to use polarizing filter plates."
830,"If you carefully search (via Google) you can find a ""7.4V 2A CA-PS700"" for your Canon camera for $8.95 with free shipping.  It is identical to the Canon labeled product. I generally buy from Amazon, but Canon's price is simply too high for this item. I have purchased the item and it works great for 20% of the cost of the identical Canon adapter."
831,"i ordered these because i had read some reviews that claimed they produced high quality sound for this style of headphone.  the price was ok, the order process was smooth and they arrived on time.  unfortunately, i really dislike their sound and don't use them.  only the manufacturer and the reviewers are to blame."
832,"I bought the second one after the first one died on me because it is very easy to set up (plug it in and it starts to work) and cheap.However, router has some serious heating problem (really, it's burning hot!)...And my second router is starting to failing again after a couple of month of use (random disconnection).If you reset by turning off for a while and restart it, it becomes ok.But after a day or two starts to fail again.In addition, can't even go to the router setup page for securing the router. Most of the time, it just redirects you to netgear's home page...Now, let's see if I get that random disconnection on submitting this review...Yup..."
833,"I hate those little dongle things that most laptop EtherNet cards have, so this is a good sollution.  Linksys makes good enough cards for most people and I like this better than the dongle.  However, 3com, and Xircom both do a much better job with the &quot;dongleless&quot; laptop cards; however, they cost significantly more.  If cost is a factor, and you hate the dongle this is a great sollution.  If you can afford them, the other cards work better, and the connection part is more functional than this one."
834,"never really happy with this unit. Constantly disconnecting, connecting etc. It got really bad to the point that it would not see my network at all for days at a time. Verizon tech support confirmed it was the router and not modem or lines.Put in a Belkin today, much easier to install and so far so good. Will give the Belkin a review once it passes the reliability test.."
835,"I bought this to boost my cable siginal which I was splitting between my TV, DVR and Computer.  The improvement wasn't as noticible as I had expected.  It does provide a boost for my rabbit ears.  I had been using an old Radio Shack amplifier that I purchased about 12 years ago.  I don't think it was much of an improvement over my old unit."
836,"This headset is worth every extra penny. I've used this model and its siblings for 3 years and attest to the quality and value of Plantronics equiptment. I've bought three of their phones (2 as gifts) and have never  had a problem. When one of their products eventually wore down from high  use, they replaced it promptly with no hassle. They make most of the call  center equiptment in the world and it shows.This is a great product made  by a great company."
837,"Ohhhh, too bad. I've owned these for a couple of months now and I'm shopping for something that works better. I can't use radio freq. wireless because they work on 900mhz and that interferese with my wireless broadband (I live in the country, far away from cable). I primarily use them while I'm running on the treadmill. They seemed to work for awhile. Not THE most comfortable things I've ever had on my head, but not the worst by far. (I had a pair I bought from Walmart for $20 which were much more uncomfortable.) The problem is as follows: static in the left ear randomly; right ear cuts out randomly and stays out; right ear cuts out, then left ear, then they go dead. This might be due to the fact that after sitting on the base to recharge, I will often see the red charge light is not on. I have to readjust the headset in the base to the get them to re-connect. I don't mind the relatively short range, since I use them in the same room, but they definitely are line of sight. I can just turn my back and lose the signal sometimes. If I'd bought these for $20, I'd say, good enough, but for $40? I'm not sure I wouldn't spend $50 or more for a more reliable set up."
838,I ordered it but turned out my laptop port was messed up so did not get much chance to use it. Still have it and it seems to work great.
839,"I shopped for a SB5110 and I never wanted a SB5100. But, somehow, I ended up buying this model. I wish I had not made such a mistake."
840,"Just has too much noise. Anything I hook up has a buzz sound to it. Would send it back, but just not worth the hassle."
841,I use these with my MP3 player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts.  They stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord.  Time will tell if they become my favorite headsets.
842,"I have a Kinesis ps/2 contoured keyboard, which is admittedly a little unusual, but another adapter I have works fine.  This one does not work at all.  At least it's cheap enough that trying didn't cost much."
843,"I was looking for a filter that would provide me with a good performance at a good price, and this one definitely nails it."
844,"I've had this product for about a year and half.  I've had no problems at all.  People can hear clearly on the other end, the Mute switch doesn't make any noise, volume control seems adequate.  It's been very durable too, I've dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected.  Most importantly, the sound reproduction quality is excellent.  Other headsets I've used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticably."
845,"Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality"
846,I bought one & never used it until 3 years later & had the hand grip break the first time I picked it up.  Vanguard replaced it and I stored until 10 years later & I went to use it the 2nd time... and the Foot thingie broke.  I glued & put back in storage until 13 years later & I tried to use it a 3rd time and while checking it out... discovered the top extendson lock bracket was broken & would not lock.  That's 3 times in about 25 years I tried to use it & could not because something was broken.  And it just sat in a corner all that time welled cared for waiting to be used.  Oviously they had production problems when my two unites were made.
847,"I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005.  The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess.  This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well.  Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement.  I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them.  Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months."
848,"I've had this modem for about 2 years, and it worked fine until about a month ago. Now, at random times, it loses it's connection to the internet and must be rebooted to get it working again. This happens at least once a day. I had a Motorola modem previously, and it also died after a couple of years. Perhaps my expectations are unrealistic, but I expect more than 2 years service from a modem. I'm replacing it with a Linksys CM100."
849,"I needed this to be able to power up and use an older version digital camera for one of my children.  This came to me as a new unit and when I plugged it in, it worked as expected.  Thanks."
850,"After a month of usage, the protective insulator came loose from where the cable enters the Ipod Dock connector, exposing bare cable.  Three days later, the built-in amplifier blew out.  It's a great idea, but I at least got a serious lemon."
851,"I bought this hub to use with my external hard drives.The hub provides poor performance in USB 2.0 mode with hard drives.  The max I get usually is 64Mbps through this hub.  Plugged directly into the same port gets me closer to 180Mbps.There are also multiple disconnects where the hub just drops out and reconnects.  I then get messages in windows about ""this device may perform faster"" (the usb 2.0 in 1.1 port message).There are 7 ports, but I'd avoid using hard drives or ready boost usb flash drives.  The chance of a disconnect is too high and could cause data corruption."
852,I purchased this speaker set for my daughter's MP3 more than the computer. It has a good sound but there is a sound distorion when you increase the volume. But i can't complain for the price paid.Don't pay more than 30 bucks for this item.
853,"This is a great product, but it has very limited in power. I noticed that if I connected too many high powered devices (such as hard drives) everything slows down. Sometimes I lose lower to my external hard drives. If I use this product for USB keys, keyboard, or just charging, then its okay. I'm not sure how many volts each port carries, but its not enough to use with multiple hard drives."
854,"After trying this product and being completly unsatisfied with it after finding all the faults listed in past reviews I decided to try a little experiment.First I measured the LCD screen on my Canon Digital Rebel XTi with a ruler and mapped them out on a piece of paper.  Then (on the same piece of paper) I drew the dimensions of the LCD screen so I had a drawn out square the exact size of my screen.Next I took a piece of Glad Cling Wrap and laid it down over the square on the piece of paper.  After taping it down so it couldn't move, I used a picture (rotary) trimmer to cut out the saran wrap laid over the paper square.I then had a perfectly sized protective sheet for my LCD.  I simply laid the saran wrap over the screen and had a better protector then the Digital Concepts product. And it was free."
855,"No jarring, No overly crazy treble sounds, and yet deep and rich.I have been using this headphones for about 2 1/2 years and i have found Its pretty good in sound reproduction and does not break/damage easily.Its also very soft on ears and does not pain the ear lobes like Sony or others do.The headband is supple, yet strong, meaning it will be firm over your ears, but not paining.Comes closest to noise-canceling feature because it covers your ears completely."
856,Only purchased this item being the Panasonic Headset I ordered from Amazon didn't show or I missed it that the headset came with a speaker and headphone splitter. Now I have this one I will probably never use. Hey you win some and you lose some my father always  told me.
857,"I have an iMac (2.33 GHz, 24"" Aluminum, Mac OS X Leopard) and a 160 GB iPod Classic.  When the iPod is plugged into the Linksys hub, iTunes reports that the iPod is connected to a low-power, low-speed USB 1.1 hub.  Very disappointing.  This hub's going back to Amazon."
858,they last 1 - 3 months then you start to hear nosie and crakels. I have had to remove every one I installed.
859,"I like my camera, it's durable and functional. The gizmo's are pretty much kept to a minimum. THOUGH, Sony has a patent on a night-vision mode that NONE of the Canon's have, which is pretty cool if you've seen it first hand. And something that stinks with many Canon products (in my experience -with scanners and camcorders) drivers and what-not always seem to be a ROYAL PAIN."
860,I bought two of these over a period of time and both of them had the same problem. Worked for a few weeks. Stopped using them for a while and then it stopped working altogether. New batteries did not help at all. Same scenario on both occasions.
861,"the lens itself is amazing. gives really good picture quality. on a scale from one to ten I give it 9 only because the out of focus lights have a funny octagon shape. it is really loud when it tries to focus specially in low light. also when in low light if your ISO is not high and/or you have a full frame it misses focus often. trust me i used it for about a year so i know how it works. yes a year. to some that is a long time but it was only used lightly ( one day out of the week because i work and not in photography)and when i got my flash and umbrella i started to used it often for the first time.highly not worth even 50 bucks yeah quality is high but it breaks with just one fall. mine fell from 1 feet high and it landed on my feet i looked and since i have dropped the camera from higher distances  didn't care. but when i looked again the tip of the lenses rolled in a separate direction after it landed, ON MY FEET. if you don't believe me the look for the drop test video for the 50mm 1.8 canon it broke in the first fall no joke and then you can't put it back together. well you can it just wont auto focus or focus properly for that matter.....oh yeah the canon warranty does not cover drops and falls :@"
862,It works for charging android phones and tablets. After the new ios7 update it also works for the Ipad min and Iphone - before the update it would not charge them. It will not charge the PS4 dualshock 4 controller.It seems to make no difference which ports are used. If a device won't charge on the regular port it also won't charge on the high current port.
863,"The concept is good, but the execution is just a bit off...The plastic shield that cover the wires to the adapters move too much... They go so far down that it gets to be problematic to fit the adapter onto the drive...it may be a simple product, but it could have been perfect, with a slight redesign."
864,"I really like the sound that these inexpensive buds gave until one of them conked out. Thinking that perhaps this was just bad luck or a fluke I returned to Amazon to buy another pair but see that this problem has occurred with other customers so I'm going with a different make and model--Sennheiser CX 300 as they are similar in price, rated well, and no mention of any problems with them breaking."
865,"I use these at work when I'm busy and need to concentrate.  I work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke LOUDLY.  That's great, except when I have a deadline.  I put these on and listen to a CD or the radio, and it shuts out the noise to the point where I can actually get some work done.  I think the sound quality is great.  The coiled cord is about 5 feet long or so and stretches out nicely.  Sony's page says the cord is 9.8 feet long, extended.  It allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled.  They are the only headphones I've been able to wear all day long without hurting my head.  I'd buy them again, especially at this price."
866,"I did lots of research before I purchased these headphones. Many of the reviews said the SportaPro offered great sound, deep bass, and wide range. Well, I have not been disappointed.Although I'm not an audio expert, I am impressed with the range of these headphones; the sound is as good or better than headphones costing $60 or more. They're pretty small, comfortable, and they're collapsible, so they're easy to carry when on the road.Some reviewers have remarked that they're ugly. I don't wear headphones to make a fashion statement, and frankly, although these aren't great looking, I don't think they're that bad either. Also, there's no longer a mute switch on these headphones. Apparently, they were causing problems (a short) so Koss removed this feature. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
867,"While it seems like a great idea, I was very disappointed in it's actual performance. The brush is a great idea although I already have several of them in my camera bags. The other end that is supposed to remove smudges and fingerprints proved to be just about useless in my opinion.After 'cleaning' two filters with the Nikon Lens Pen, I used a micro fiber cloth to actually get the smudges and film off both sides of the filters.As far as I'm concerned it's not even worth giving away as stocking stuffer."
868,My oldest son had this model for several years and my other son  or his dog or some imaginary elf hadapparently ruined these beyond repair.......and &#34;Never to be found again&#34; according to the oldest son.  To savebloodshed I hopped on Amazon and found the exact model available and shipped home in a few days!Amazon &#34;IS&#34; the place!
869,"Works - but there's a background hum when using it.  But for the price, what do you expect? We use it on a electric keyboard so the kids can play and we don't have to listen!"
870,"Tiffen and Hoya both make decent, mid-priced filters. For the basics, you can't go wrong with these. I've owned many Tiffen filters over the years, never had a problem."
871,"This item was no good for my Macbook pro, either by design or this particular one was faulty.  When I connected a keyboard using this cable, my Macbook powered off and would not turn on again.  I brought my Macbook to my local Apple store, made an appointment for their &#34;Genius Bar,&#34; and they were able to take my Macbook to the back room, remove the battery, and reset the computer.  As a test, they plugged just this cable into one of their Macbooks, and it caused that Macbook to shut down also.  This cable drew too much current.  Either it's a bad design, or I received one faulty cable by bad luck.  Either way, I won't risk trying a replacement cable, and, for this price, I probably won't bother returning this.  I will simply purchase a new full-size USB keyboard, rather than trying to use an old keyboard with this cable."
872,I really like this kit and only have one complaint: there could be a larger range of choices for socket sizes.
873,I brought this product several days now an is unable to use it as the ports for the radio is different that what came on the item... I searched for an M1 plug before purchasing and it came up with this item... The display photo did not display the jack either... I was gonna return the item but ordered an adapter instead...Motorola Earpiece with Boom Microphone
874,"I bought this cable to replace a misplaced Garmin Nuve 1450 GPS data cable.As an aside, my Canon Powershot S70 digital camera data cable works fine as a substitute cable for my Garmin.The cable under review is advertised to work with the Canon S70 camera---and it does! However, it will not work with the Garmin GPS as a data cable. Go figure. It appears you can charge the Garmin while plugged into a USB port with this cable, but it will not connect to the computer for data transfer.Quality of the cable is fine."
875,"I ordered this cable in August. The seller did send it out relatively quickly; however, the U.S. Post Office near Washington, D.C. had it in their facility for five days (I know this because I tracked it being logged in at that facility every day). LOUSY USPS service on this.In order to ensure correct color when connecting my pc to my 40"" tv, I must move the cable around a bit and somehow keep it in a certain position. It seems that the module that is located close to one end of the cable is affecting the signal. Kind of a hassle, but it does work and the video quality is O.K. when I get the cable in just the right position. And, yes, the connections are tight...Would I buy it again? Yes, because the length is good, the cable is heavy, and I CAN get it to work. For the price, can't do better."
876,"Bose Acoustimass speaker systems are a strange animal.  You either love them or hate them.It's a funny thing, This guy was at my house and heard my Quad ESL speakers (electrostatic) ($5,000) with about $6,000 worth of electronics and made the comment that they sounded almost as good as his Bose.So there you go, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.Myself, I'm not too keen on Bose and I could go on a tirade about what I don't like about them, but in the end, it's what you think.  If they make you happy, then by God, you've made the right choice.Bose are very colored speakers, bright highs and warm syrupy bass.  This is a sound that many people like.  The fact that they don't take up much room fits into many lifestyles.If you like accuracy and want to get closer to real, then try something else.For me, Bose has a pleasant sound that is nice to listen to at low volume when I just want background sound.  I can even think of other uses for these, in non critical applications.  I've even considered them for a second TV.  They are much better than the speakers that come in TV's nowadays.For the $399 they are asking for these,  you could do much worse.  You could also do much better depending on your preferences.Would I recommend these?  Sure, depending on whether someone wanted a small unobtrusive system or whether they liked the Bose sound.  If I felt the person was inclined toward accuracy, clarity, and soundstaging, then I would steer them away from these.Does Bose deserve all the accolades that it receives?  Not really.  They are very over rated, but still, they're not bad speakers.I gave these a 3 star rating only because in some circumstances these are perfect for the application.  If I were to rate it against my preferences, I would give it a lower rating.BTW, this applies to all Acoustimass systems.Oh, there's one more thing...Bose likes to use the direct/reflecting concept of sound.  This has the effect of making the sound more spacious, but it destroys the soundstaging.  People in high end audio go to great efforts to eliminate or disperse reflections, because it ruins soundstaging and causes frequency aberrations (nulls and peaks)."
877,"First, these are not intended for loud places. You should be using these for a study, or library reading etc- not in a busy loud place. These are in no way intended for blocking noise- you will end up turning them up loud, and hurt your ears. But anyway, these are nice. Found em via Cnet. Easily fold up, but don't realy fit in the bag- i never have really needed it. As for comfort, you can't even tell they are there. As for sound- great highs, and not bad lows- all around goodness. Lifetime warranty was the selling point for me- i have already gone through about 10 or so pairs of the cheap skull candies- i would rather have something i could depend on. Just 9 or so bucks to ship and a new pair- i haven't had to do it yet, but it is there when i need it. All and all, awesome."
878,"Santa brought me these after I had done some extensive research. I've always been content spending a little extra money for quality and peace of mind; these headphones are one of the rare occurrences when you can get an incredible product at an extremely reasonable price. Lightweight, comfortable and sturdily built headphones with an incredibly balanced sound. Bass is very accurate and complements vocals and instruments nicely. Find myself wearing these for hours on end with no irritation, although clearly head and ear shape vary greatly, the MDR-V6 will be a steady companion of mine for the foreseeable future."
879,"Still love the Porta Pros, which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound. Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros, which are much more valued in Europe, I found out from a friend. Excellent warm sound, a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience, not at all."
880,"One of the drawbacks of Amazon is returning marginal items, and this is one of those.  I bought a Nikon binocular (which I really like) to replace my older Brunton binoculars, and I bought this harness for the Nikon.  But I liked my Cabelas camo harness for the Brunton so much I swapped it off and never used the Nikon harness, so this Nikon harness has just been sitting in the box."
881,"The Verbatim DC Storage Cases are okay.  They do not have the quality of the HP branded cases that I had before.  On the plus slide, they are in assorted colors (The HP cases were black and clear)"
882,"I ordered two of these StarTech 6-Feet Coax High Resolution VGA Monitor Cables. I use them to connect my desktop PC to my LCD PC-monitor with the resolution set at 1920 X 1080 pixels. One works fine; the other doesn't.  With the bad one, the graphics exhibit ghost images. When I connected this bad one to another monitor, I got even worse result - the display was very dim and reddish. Wriggling it didn't help. One or more pins were not making connections. The picture of the cable in this web page is inaccurate. It depicts connectors with only 14-pins and pin #9 missing. The actual cable I received has all 15 pins, including pin #9. (See my uploaded image.) It is actually a good thing that this cable has all 15-pins because some LCD and plasma TV monitors will not work without pin #9 (See my comment below for further explanation). The cables look solidly constructed and the price is very reasonable.  However, due to one defective cable out of two in the same order, I only recommend this VGA cable to Amazon shoppers with reservation.  Of course, you can always return it within a month if it turns out to be defective."
883,"Love them, sound fantastic, easy to ware.  I'm a programmer and I ware them for about 6 hours a day every workday while listing to music.-James"
884,"recognize that less than stellar reviews are almost labeled as 'not helpful' because people somehow take it personally that another person has disparaged some product that they want positive validation on.  So be it.  Here's the honest review of the Expert Mouse nonetheless.For $80.00, I'm shocked.  This is an incredibly cheapo feeling product.  My purpose in going this route was to eliminate some growing wrist pain.  I can already tell that a trackball is going to help; but it won't be this trackball.  My days are spent with Photoshop, InDesign, and a myriad other applications that demand extremely precise cursor and tracking accuracy.  This trackball rests on tiny plastic/nylon bearings that either do not rotate or do so VERY poorly.  All of which leaves the trackball to herky jerky around.  Yes, there are extensive settings in the driver software to fine tune some the actions for your personal needs.  But understand this very clearly, the fine tuning is meaningless because the actual mechanical workings of the ball are sooooooooo poorly designed.  Both the ball itself and supposedly magnificent scroll wheel operate with the feeling and sound of grinding coffee.  Overall the operation is typical of a mouse costing maybe $12.00, not a penny more.  I realize this is sad news for those of you really looking for a positive review.  And believe me, I have reviewed things for Amazon very favorably, but for $80.00 this particular item is just very close to being as useless as it can be."
885,"I bought these because I did NOT want ear bud headphones.  Well, they disguise it well, but they are ear bud style.  The rubber guides that go around your ears are way too big and they do nothing in helping to keep the bud in your ear.  I am very dissapointed.  Waste of money.  I would not recommend these to anyone."
886,Taking care of your disc's is very important. and this is a very good set for that. I have used these for years and never had a problem
887,"I have been in the entertainment industry for thirty five plus years .. Watching to pros around me use these headphones must have stuck in my head .. I just started a new business, needed headphones and the MDRV600s became the obvious choice .. They are comfortable to wear - Have a long cable and seem to reproduce a fine spectrum of natural sound .. I love these things .. I just wonder why I waited this long .. I should have had these to listen to my music a long while ago - There great!"
888,"As a computer monitor, the 170MP is very easy on the eyes, with good (and adjustable) color rendition, contrast, and brightness. The viewing angle is about as wide as it gets-almost on par with Apple's overpriced 17 inch; not only does the brightness not fade, but there is little color shift. There really isn't much to say, as it performs as well as I would want it too.As a video monitor, it is lacking. I have fed it with satellite and DVD signals, using both the S video and RCA inputs (no real difference in viewable quality). At default settings, the picture was grainy and had the same sort of problems I associate with over sharpening on digital images. The major tweaking I did was to turn down the sharpening, using the nicely designed menu system. This made the picture soft, but to me far more acceptable.Please note, I have not tried the built in tuner, as I don't have a good antennae to hook it up to. I just tried satellite and DVD feeds. I use a Samsung HDTV 30 inch &quot;TV&quot; (which has an incredibly good picture-try this beffore you spend the extra money on Sony, Philips, Panasonic, et al...) so I am comparing it to a VERY good benchmark. However, I think that it should have the circuitry inside it to produce a video image that is as good as my last TV did. Compared to the HDTV (which is upconverting the feed), the 170MP was lacking in brightness, contrast, resolution, and blackness. This seems odd because it really does look great (wide contrast range, good blacks, etc.) as a computer monitor."
889,not what I was looking for. product no better than cheapos that come with cheap mp3 players
890,"This little headphone produces beautiful sound with comfort, I liked the retro look and think it's cool. After reading so many positive reviews and saw it on sale for under $25, why not? I am so glad I did, the shipping took longer than expected, about 2 weeks but it's worthy of the wait. IMO, this little headphone sounded better than Beats and Sol at a fraction of cost. I am a little picky about audio sound and wouldn't buy a car without a great audio system, skipped Bose, went  for HK Logic 7 for my car. Love this little Koss and highly recommend it."
891,I hate it if it didn't work.  But it does work and was just the right length that I needed.
892,"The only negative thing I have to say about this is that they are not of the greatest quality.  The connectors are not snag free and it is possible for the blue outer insulator to slide back after some movement exposing the thin wires.  Also, the outer insulator is pretty thin.With these points in mind, the cables work well, I have purchased several of them.  If changes were made to correct the issues I described, you could easily expect them to cost 2-3x as much.  If you were to wire it and leave it, these are great options, if you are going to use these will work but will leave you wanting better quality."
893,"I received the cable in a timely manner and it works as it should although it is very stiff. It is advertised as Belkin cable but that is not the brand name on the cable,the brand is CMPLE. In addition it was 24' long not 25' as specified....it worked but with no room to spare. I am satisfied for the price but feel it is misrepresented. When compared to actual Belkin cable (name on it) it is thinner and considerably stiffer, the Belkin is much  more supple."
894,"Of course, any audio situation is a matter of personal taste--but--I suggest anyone try these who wants to hear what headphones can be.They have the best bass--the purest highs and they are comfortable for listening over a long period. Be aware that these will go very loud--far more than most--so be wary when you listen a lot.I have had a pair for around 25 years--and I have replaced the ear pads--and they have worked fine always. I paid $100 when I bought them--around $210 in today's dollars. This price is exceptional. I was going to buy another pair--but saw no need. Professionals use them. I have had many other good ones--but--these are in a class by themselves. You will not be disappointed.Another good choice is the Sennheiser HD202--my second favorite pair and a bargain.And I hope all of you realize that ""ear buds""--are just wrong--useful only in unusual circumstances."
895,"I am not an expert as much as the others posting here, all I know is that my original iPod earbuds were quite uncomfortable. I replaced them with this Sportapro and played Joni Mitchell's ""Hejira' on my iPod and it sounded STELLAR.Do be careful handling these as they seem less than rugged."
896,"I honestly felt compelled to write this after reading many of the other reviews.  It seems that everyone out there rating the product high has &quot;just got it this morning&quot; and everyone else seems to be complaining about repairs and such.Well, my case is different.  I bought my Nomad II MG a little over a year ago along with a friend of mine.  We got them at the same time, from the same store and with an extra 64MB (total 128MB).I use the unit every day while going to and from the office (at least 2 hours a day).  In my experience, the battery will not last more than 5-6 hours (they say 8).  Having said that, I have not had to replace the battery.Let me get the bad out of the way first...- The buttons are extremely sensitive.  After a while, I wound up locking up the unit and just let it run on random.- Random logic seems &quot;not so random&quot;.- Controls are not intuitive and take some getting used to.- SmartMedia card will sometimes stop working.  Shutdown, remove and replace usually solves this.- The headphones are horrible!  Extremely uncomfortable!  I wound up buying Sony Phonotopia.- There was a shutdown problem while docked which was solved when I upgraded firmware.If after reading the previous list you think I hate this unit, think again...  I love it!This unit is extremely light, small and portable.  You can carry it in a shirt pocket.  Easy to carry in any season.If you get the 128MB total, you have an average 2 hours of music to go along with you.  Got tired of the same music?  Switch to the FM tuner and you're good to go. (or switch to 96kbps sampling rate and cram more songs in)This unit has great sound.  I also found it to be loud enough for my taste.  I always use sound level at 30 (50 max).For the record, the sync software is very easy to use...My friend has had the same experience with this MP3 player as I have.  We're both very happy with it and I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
897,"Bought quantity 2 of these packs and out of each box, there were three cracked cases.  Bad packaging?Speaking of packaging, both boxes came in a plain brown cardboard box, looked nothing like the fancy photo shown with the product ad.They are thin and maybe a bit flimsy but for the price, they worked for me."
898,"In response to the kid's question, no, it doesn't fit the Battery Pack with the case.  I bought this thing, and have never used it, and according to these reviews, I may not."
899,Bad news...  These players aparently suffer from a hardware flaw involving the Progressive Scan.  Many users report problems involving video quality issues after activating the progressive scan feature (including myself).  To solve please go to CyberHome's website and click on support to RMA your player.  Unfortunately a firmware upgrade will not help this.
900,"Just bought this Palm for a significant person in my life.  Had the opportunity to prep it.  The bright color screen is beautiful, and using the built-in camera can't get any easier.  The screen feels a little slippery, and Graffiti 2, which still requires you to memorize some weird shorthands, takes some getting used to for people new to Graffiti and also old-time Palm users.Overall I'm still impressed with Palm's simplicity and speed.  And I appreciate the ability to sync with Outlook, using an included third-party app.But I'm very disappointed in the way Palm implements multimedia functions.  In this area, the Pocket PC is way simpler.  Let me expound.To play audio files (only MP3 and RealAudio are supported), you MUST purchase a secure digital expansion card.  Of course, given the Zire 71 only has 13MB of user memory, you wouldn't fit too many MP3 songs in the internal RAM anyway if you could.  But, still, it would have been nice to be able to carry two favorite songs with me without the SD memory.  And had Palm chosen to license Microsoft's WMA technology, we could get the same sound quality at half the file size as standard MP3.So you need to purchase an SD card, and then install RealOne Player from the 2nd companion CD.  The choice of RealOne is not a blessing, because Real's software is totally invasive, even more so than Microsoft's.  And copying MP3 files from your Windows desktop to the Zire is a total pain: first you have to create a playlist in RealOne, then specify which files in RealOne to copy, and finally copy.  With Pocket PC, I just use Windows Explorer to go to the My Music directory on the Pocket PC, and then drag-and-drop MP3 and WMA files.  (On the Mac, you'd use Hotsync, which makes it easier than on Windows.  It puzzles me why Palm chose not to implement the same technique on Windows.)To play video files, you'd need to install both the Kinoma Player and Quick Time.  Then, each time you want to copy a file to the Zire, you must use Kinoma to convert the source file (AVI, MPEG and MOV are supported), a time-consuming process.  This is true on both Windows and Mac.  If you have a fast P4 the process is not as painful, but still it's totally unnecessary.  Again, on the PPC, I just drop-and-drop video files into the My Documents folder (or a subfolder) and voila.So if you are buying the Zire 71 for multimedia functionalities, hold off your purchase and wait until Palm improves this area.  If you are buying it for snapping pictures, go for it."
901,"As a personal GPS and especially at walking or sailing speeds the GPS V is fine. The display is OK for casual use and the unit is able to hold the maps for more land or water than you can sail or ride over in a day. If you aren't in a hurry or especially demanding then you should be delighted with this unit. I have it as my primary GPS and it isn't sufficiently problematic that I intend to replace it, I'll soldier on and hope for some software updates for now.For use in cars and for more demanding users there are some significant drawbacks.During configuration it takes around an hour to load a full set of maps, 115kbps is not sufficient for loading 19Mb of data in reasonable time. This discourages modifying the map set, which reduces usability if you live round a big city.The processor performance is borderline. For normal use the low power consumption of a relatively slow processor allows good battery life. For car use the power consumption is not an issue but the time taken to redraw the screen, which can be many seconds, becomes extremely significant. The menus are slow, it can take a couple of seconds to go between two entries in a list and I'm not even using WAAS. Routing also takes some time, mostly this isn't too important because once you are on a route it shouldn't recalculate often.There are some bugs, which may have been fixed recently. When I upgraded the firmware the unit started dropping out during route calculation. I wrote to Garmin about this but got absolutely no response. That's a mark down for customer support too.The address entry is cumbersome. In addition, if you don't cancel any other route that was in operation the unit will interrupt and discard your tedious entry if it completes the calculation. If it doesn't then it will start on the new route.Directions can be slow to paint, the wrong directions are sometimes shown until the unit catches up and swaps over to the correct picture. If one turn follows another fairly rapidly it may not tell you about the second turn until after the turn has passed, this is associated with the slow repaint.When routing information is shown the native menus of the interrupted screen are not available, so if you have a sequence of directions to follow and wish to do something else the unit keeps interrupting and refusing your menu selections... there are no menu entries in the routing screen.Perhaps I should have bought a more expensive model, but what could I get that is reasonably portable?Finally, some of the routes would best be described as 'entertaining' or on a less charitable day 'indirect'. For example, when the route from Via Del Oro via Bernal Road to US 101 is being followed in San Jose CA the directions will sometimes tell you to cross Bernal Road (ignoring the left turn) and then to take three right turns. On other occasions it will indicate the left turn. Routing seems dependant on precise location.Finally, customer support at Garmin did not respond. I'd be happy to help them make this a better product, but they'd need to be interested.12/21/2004Last time I checked there were no further software updates, so it looks like Garmin aren't interested in their legacy customers. That means my next GPS will have to be from someone else.I found another routing amusement. Returning from the far north of California I didn't include the Marin county maps but I had included Sacramento because I had intended to return on I-5. When I got well down US101 (a mountain range and probably 70 miles off I-5) I was getting crazy arrival times. Eventually I found that at Ukiah it wanted me to turn east and cross to I-5 because I didn't have the detailed map for the next hundred miles of US101 to Richmond where the bay area maps resumed. It should not favor the downloaded maps to this extent.On the bright side this and my old GPS III+ continue to function almost as advertised. Years of faithful, if slightly eccentric, service.12/17/05I now have a Tomtom Navigator 5 and their Bluetooth GPS receiver and iGuidance 2.1.3 for Europe. The newer software and receiver puts this old machine in a better light than you might think. True the SIRF III receiver is significantly better than this old Garmin. It may be old and slow and hard to use compared to the newer machines, but it does have an almost clairvoyant ability to correctly estimate trip times. If you are looking for an instrument that can record tracks and will show you a lot of current data (course, eta, time to destination, altitude, track, bearing to destination, time to next waypoint, distance to next waypoint, altitude, speed, time of day, date, trip distance, trip time, ...) then this will be a lot more use to you than the late 2005 Tomtom and iGuidance software. But for them my PDA has the high detail maps for the entire US, Canada and UK and it took less time to install than it takes to copy half the bay area to this unit.If I'm heading for the woods or the water this is still the best GPS for me."
902,"I've been waiting for something like this for forever. I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, MP3, WMA, and WAV files (plus many others). You can download updates from the Nomad website for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 3-4 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It has its flaws, but in the future there will be improvements &amp; upgrades available. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now."
903,I bought these as a gift because I had bought these very same headphones for myself years ago.  I love them.
904,Convenient but tools aren't very durable if used a lot. I like that a few extra tools fit into case.
905,"Very poor quality and poor sound. I bought this as replacement for Sony MDR-W08, they don't even come close to the sound, comfort or quality.  Can't use them at all."
906,it okay so far the purpose that i bought it for will not work the laptop seen to use the 3.5mm Plug (4 Pole) that
907,It is a very practical and handy collection of tools in a convenient case which served my need in good order
908,"As every 3rd review is saying, the radio will not hold a station. You will be listening and the station will just fade out. You will retune it and then it will happen again and again. When I grew up all FM radio's had a switch for this problem I think it said AFC switch for automatic frequency control. It would make a tuner less sensitive.TIVOLI,IF YOU READ THESE REVIEWS, YOU COULD ADD THIS SWITCH!Tivoli just keeps making this radio because it sells on it's good looks, but they don't address this problem.I own a digital radio that does not do this."
909,I use it when I am jogging and it does not fall off and also sounds great.The main issue is the plastic folding mechanism. I can already see the strain on the plastic joints when I fold and unfold. I have already stopped folding it to prevent breakage.3 stars. Could have made better joints or used metal encased in plastic body for rigidity.
910,"Great performance, quiet, has a glass jaw (if it were a brawler in a back alley). My computer crashed recently and took the hard drive with it. Though several other components like a TV tuner card and a SCSI card died I didn't expect the hard drive to go south. And I heard from a guy at a computer store near here that hard drives above a certain GB (80 GB I think) from any brand are known to have severe problems. And when they have them boy do they have them. It'll take me $300 to #500 to send it to a data recovery lab and get my data back. And I'm debating if it's worth it.UPDATE: I finally bought data recovery program from OnTrack and, miraculously, that did the trick of saving my data to a different HD. Shortly after that the HD truely died. It would cause my computer to sound an alarm for the S.M.A.R.T. system at start up. YIKES! Don't worry, it was a problem limited to the hard drive only. Maybe if I kept it hooked up to the motherboard it would do something horrible in the future. But as soon as it took a swan dive I sent it in for a replacement. Now I have the hard drive on a IDE to USB adapter connected to a USB 2.0 card. I'm not taking any chances. While it's nice to have a warehouse of data storage on my computer currently I will be shopping around for a different brand or maybe a WD newer model known to be reliable.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: Some clunking noises, but that was my own fault when I was moving the hard drive (very carefully) and lightly knocked it against the desk. So far it's fine on the USB 2.0 connection. I am seriously considering it as my main drive with my old 5400RPM as backup. I will possition my WD2500 in front of the front case fan though.Even on USB 2.0 it's fast as liquid lightning. I remember how fast it was on the ATA bus. Can't wait to put it back. It is a 7200 RPM drive after all. But ultimately I plan on moving to SATA and getting a world of storage with 4 500GB hard drives from another brand (Hitachi I think).Last impressions. Reliability on initial drive was immediately bad and apparent. Second drive seems reliable, but seeing as there are so many reviews about the bad reliability like my experience I'd have to put this as a black mark against Western Digital. I did get a Western Digital external 120GB hard drive simply to transfer what I have on the 250GB hard drive to that. And I'll just use the 250GB HD as a gaming installs hard drive and a video cache drive. Simple. No long term user made data storage on the WD2500."
911,"For non-critical, multi-room, single zone audio, these get the job done and are priced right.I installed two of these in a home where the previous owner took the amp and switches when they sold.  The existing volume controls were non-impedance matching and I didn't perform any measurements, but two of these switches with 11 pairs of speakers enabled presented a manageable load to the 150wpc 2 channel amp allowing hours of continuous use without forcing the amp into thermal shut down.I should also point out to others that these are impedance matching, not volume matching, they average out the electrical load placed on the amplifier.  This is important because if you have different speakers with different sensitivities (dbl/wm), you will end up with different apparent audio levels in different rooms (I should have thought to explain that to this customer before hand)."
912,The construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb. It is lightweight and comfortable for long hours.
913,"I have tried a lot of different things and am unable to get the product to work.  There were no instructions.  Maybe there's a setting I don't know about?  I put the camera on manual or auto, with or without the rubbver protective casing, and it doesn't work at all.  I have a Tamron lens.  I don't know where the pickup is for the remote or whether you have to be in front of the camera to trigger it.  None of the reviews I saw on Amazon addresses my challenge."
914,My LS443 camera worked fairly well for about 1 1/2 years and then all of a sudden it would not take any pictures.  Everything in the video display window was black - if you snapped a photo - it was also black.  I contacted tech support and learned that they would take the LS443 back and for a mere $100 exchange it for a DX7440.  Why in the world would I chance another Kodak camera.  NEVER AGAIN!!  This was not a great camera to begin with but to have a camera simply die that was not overused nor abused is simply unacceptable.  Does Kodak care?  Not a bit - there will be others who buy their product based on the reputation of the company.  Well I hope this review informs you that that reputation is not so well-deserved.
915,it does what its supposed to. i lost my printer cable in the process of moving. you can never have too many of these. great price on amazon as usual
916,"I use Bose when travelling for the noise cancellation, but I don't need to leave the Bose around so the cat can play with it at home.This is a great substitue.  The over-the-ear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in.  Perhaps not as neatly as a $300 pair of Bose, but eminently reasonable for hanging around home.  A great bargain to boot!  Thanks Koss - even your cheap ones are fabulous."
917,"I've been in the broadcasting business for over 15 years and these are the best headphones I've ever used.  It took some convincing to invest in them, since I usually bought cheaper headphones.  But the cheap ones last a few months, and the Sony MDR-V6s last years.  You won't be sorry with this headphones!"
918,"These are fantastic. I'm a DJ, but now find myself toting these around everywhere because I just don't want to listen to my music without them. My fiance is not a DJ, but steals these from me all the time.- They can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion.- They are sturdy, have a coily cord that's only connected at the left ear, and fold neatly into a little bad (included).- They totally block out outside noise. At a gig, you can't hear what you're pumping over the speakers if you don't want to. At a coffee shop, no one can tell your music is outrageously loud.- Intense rich bass. Even when you really crank the volume, it's like the bass vibrates your head, instead of blasting your eardrums.A really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume, and hold the ear cups together. You can barely hear a thing, but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands. When you open them, you'll be shocked at how much volume they're putting out.One last note, I bought the 1000's, was disappointed, and bought these. Definitely the way to go."
919,"These Sony headphones are good but do have issues,the on off switch is located in a bad spot hard to turn off and on.Not real comfortable not what you expect from Sony!These are over priced by at least $15.00.Would not buy these again."
920,Fast shipping. The difference compared to regular pictures wasnt as great as i wished but it certainly reduced a lot of extra glare. Its worth it
921,"I guess the designer of this product wanted, for some reason, to allow eyepieces to be used inside it. Or perhaps a barlow lens. But the result is an adapter that is longer than it needs to be, and that moves the camera about an inch farther than necessary from the image plane of the telescope's primary optic. This makes the adapter unusable with most Newtonian reflectors built for visual use, because the film/sensor plane of the camera can't be brought close enough to the objective to bring an image into focus. Even on a refractor of catadioptric telescope, the length of the adapter needlessly increases torque around the point where the focusing tube enters the focuser. I'm not sure whether Amazon carries any, but there are low-profile adapters that minimize this effect, and are better for astrophotography."
922,Cheap and not worth the cost spent it picks up too much interference and unable to refine tuning.  Save your money.
923,"You can get more flash for your dime if you go offbrand, but I wanted HSS. The 420EX is e-ttl only: manual flash cannot be set on the unit or from my T2i. It works great as an off-camera fill flash outdoors (HSS with e-ttl cord) or as an easy bounce flash indoors (on-camera for its focus assist). It does auto-zoom when you have an appropriate lens attached; it defaults to 50mm for other lenses. Tilt and swivel are great. Construction quality is excellent, but due to the design of the battery hatch, I feel as if I might break it any time I change the batteries. I don't really require quick recycle times, so I can't evaluate that. Battery life seems great. If you have a commander, the 420EX can be an wireless slave. I'll report more about that after I win the lottery and buy a 580EX II.Edit (Aug. 2012): I now own three Canon 420EXs. They're a lot of flash for the money, and they have Canon wireless and HSS. I trigger mine with Yongnuo's ST-E2.The 420EX has a plastic foot. I broke the side of one foot when a light stand blew over. I've glued it back, and all systems are good,"
924,fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement
925,It's hard to review this product because it's so simple and not a lot of variance on what it can be used for.  This does what it says and says what it does!
926,"I am in a job that requires me to be on the phone all the time.  I have been using this same exact brand of Plantronics headset for years.  It lasts about 1-2 years, but that seems about the norm with all the headsets I have had, or have heard about from others.  I like that there is a mute option on the wire and it is very comfortable."
927,The tool set contains everything you need to work on solid state circuit boards. Nicely laid out and easy to use. Demagnetization is a real plus. I recommend it.
928,"These are nice, take up little room when you need to store a bunch of them, but they do open easily... dumping discs out in your bag, briefcase etc... Also, I have ordered literally hundreds of these, and each time I recieve them, no matter how well protected, they're are usually anywhere from three to seven broken ones in the bunch from the jostling around they take during shipping."
929,"I will be brief:The headphones are remarkably uncomfortable. I'd like to think I have a normal-shaped head and the stiff 'bow' of the 'phones doesn't conform to my head at all. I am constantly re-adjusting them after they slide down and hit my neck.The sounds quality is fair, at best. There is CONSTANT 'hiss', even at very low volume. I have tried combating this by turning the volume of the headphones to low and my MacBook Pro's volume to high. It's still there.The product claims to have a 3 meter range. That is laughable. In a roughly high frequency-free environment my headphones cut out if I am more than FIVE FEET from the transmitter. Even on a full battery, the range is laughable.I am somewhat brand-loyal to Sony. 90% of my electronic equipment comes from them, and I am usually impressed with their products. I realize that this is a cheaper-end product, but I expected AT THE VERY LEAST a pair of headphones that didn't out-and-out hurt my head when I use them."
930,"I had the chance to borrow this camera and use it for a couple days. The camera is easy to operate, looks nice, and produces pretty good results. This camera is proof that for 8x10 prints, a 2.1 megapixel CCD is sufficient...but I wouldn't go any bigger than that. 8x10 is really the limit with 2 megapixels. It's easy to connect to the computer and download images. The 10x zoom is sweet. After using this camera and going back to another camera with only a 3x zoom, I felt deprived. AND IT'S IMAGE STABILIZED!!! However, there are a few things that really bothered me about this camera:a. Fastest shutter speed is 1/800 of a second in non-automatic modes. That's not very fast. If you're trying to capture fast moving objects, forget about it. Your picture will be a blur, especially if you're using that 10x zoom.b. The purple fringing, aka chromatic aberration, you see on digital cameras sometimes is pretty bad on this camera. From what I've been told, this is common on Olympus cameras.c. I don't like how the on/off/reset-settings selections are all on the same switch. It is WAY too easy to accidently push the switch up too far to the reset-settings selection, and wipe out all the custom settings you've made. Olympus really should've made this a seperate switch.Overall I liked the results, but I decided not to buy this camera due to the faults I listed. If Olympus makes another camera like this, with what I listed fixed (and hopefully with a 3 megapixel chip as well), I'll be the first to buy it."
931,"There are a few things that I had to upgrade in this kit. The flashlight, solder, and screwdriver (needed a magnetized one), I also added zip ties. Other than that the kit is awesome, and has a lot of the tools a computer tech would need."
932,"No, don't waste your money, poor music quality, was very unsatisfied, once purchased a different model, was much much happrier even spent less and a lot better music sounds from the same resource. Ended up returning."
933,"This is a hard to find adapter, taking 1/8 line to dual XLR L/R line.  I purchased it as an emergency way to get my iPod into my console gendered to plug in exactly where the output from my audio interface in case the interface dies).  I wouldn't trust this for anything but an emergency 1shot connection.  Hosa makes a lot of great stuff on paper, hard to find adapters, etc,  Its a shame they don't make 2 distinct product lines - a pro line that is more expensive but built with materials a professional could count on and their existing line.  Maybe they do, but I haven't see them.  Having cables like this one custom made with quality materials is prohibitive (or time consuming, if your schedule is crammed) so, I guess it should be a positive thing these are available.  It's just a shame I barely trust them out of the package, let alone in daily use."
934,"I needed the best CD-Rs available in a hurry, so I went to Walgreen's and passed up on Memorex, Sony, and another less expensive brand in favor of this golden-faced Maxell CD-R 30-count music spindle.  They were all coasters, playing intermittently and then sticking.  Not a usable one in the bunch.[Amazon doesn't deliver on Saturday, or I could have waited.  the 100 CD-R spindle of Verbatim discs that I had ordered from Amazon came on Monday.  Immediately, I tried burning the same 60-minute music file using the same equipment for recording and playing back the file.  No problems.  Perhaps it could just as easily have been the other way around.  Nevertheless, it's somewhat like the restaurant business.  If that first meal is undercooked, etc., the customer is hesitant to return. These Maxells do have a somewhat embossed, uneven upper surface to accommodate the fancy gold and silver patterns.  I'm not sure, but that tiny irregularity could be too much for some players to cope with.]"
935,"This purchase was for a backup of one I had bought previously that has worked very well. After reading other reviews where people had stated that it only lasted 4-6 months before breaking I bought another one for back up. I have found it to be very comfortable and have used it several times for 1-2 hour conversations. I have put my phone in my shirt pocket and roamed the house while talking with no loss of clarity. I may have to buy another one as my wife is thinking of using the backup. I don't think the unit is that fragile, but some people are hard on things. I don't know if I would recommend it for continuous all day use, but if handled with reasonable care it seems it should last a lot longer then 6 months."
936,I ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both. Have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great. Not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that I keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either.
937,i did not expect i would be writting this review for this product. my initial experience was very good and the product performed as advertised. Unfortunately some where along the line the software suffered the same fate as other customers. that is the client software crashes and refuses to run under xp pro. the online tech support is useless and the fact pages clearly are not addressing this problem. it makes the product useless and a nice paper weight. for background i have tried re-installing the software and .net many times to see if i could fix the problem (by the way the uninstaller also crashes so this is a manual process) with no success. i really like linksys products as they are doing some neat stuff but it is clear they are having some real technical support issues. make sure you can get a refund if you buy this product!
938,"This is a cheap and utilitarian basic tool kit. It has just what you need for working on your hardware and nothing more. A couple philips and a couple flat-heads with a nice little parts retrieving tool. If you just need an extra kit around, it's worth it. No frills and not something you'll want to use for heavy duty jobs, but if you're putting a computer together, go for it. You can buy more expensive ""computer tool kits"", but they tend to mostly come with a lot of additional pieces that you'll never use, like a ""memory chip remover/setter"". When was the last time anyone needed that?!"
939,"I don't know if it's my TV or this video selector switch that makes my TV screen black out and display ""Unusable Signal"" during every commercial and sometimes annoyingly through the good parts of a movie, or a show. Otherwise, that said, it doesn't distort the sound or picture."
940,"Good filter, does the job.  Using this on my Canon 24-105mm Lens, no problems. ... ... ... ... .. .."
941,These must have been sized on a balloon. they didn't fit. They were ugly. They were cheap. waste of good money.
942,I brought this to replace a VERY  old RCA TV  with a corroded remote.  Initially it worked for my husband but when I tried several times later.  I couldn't get it to work
943,"This is my second pair and I have nothing but good things to say!  Comfortable, good bass depth and very durable. Volume control is a huge plus, especially in the workshop which is where I am most of the time."
944,Its cheaply made. The connectivity is unreliable- any budge of your laptop will make this thing disconnect.I think most hubs come with 220v compatability so its no special trait here.
945,"My first complaint about this is probably a single case situation.  No AC adaptor that I buy works.  I called customer service and they told me they'ld send me one for free.  They were very friendly and helpfull about it...trouble is I never got it.  I use rechargable batteries now instead.My second complaint is the navigation.  Unless you have a playlist set up, you may want to navigate a lot and it's not easy.  once you do scroll through the list of what's usually 150 songs, when you find the one you want, often it takes 15-20 seconds to load the song.  This doesn't happen if it just plays through them...only if you navigate to them.  It appears to be trying to determine how that particular song is coded (mp2, mp3, bitrate, etc), but I don't know why it takes so long unless it's prebuffering the entire song.However, the abilty to play cd's and cdr's with over 160 songs on one disc is so useful.  No memory sticks - just record all your cds onto a few cds and take those with you wherever you go.  It never skips, has decent battery useage, and a very simple and useful on-wire remote control so you can keep the player out of harms way."
946,"Incredible headphones. I'm not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers, but I love to listen to music. My office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick.After a full 8 hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them, but I usually don't wear them all day. The ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material. The sound is amazing! I think I can hear more music through these headphones than I do my stereo system at home.Cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks. It is long enough to plug into my PC and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to PC with no troubles.Great buy, I am really impressed with these headphones. Highly recommended."
947,"I wish I had bought a CDRW sooner. No issues installing it on my Win 2K/Win98 dual boot machine or. I had more problems figuring out what was the Slave/Master setting on the pre-installed DVD.Software is that it assumes you already had a CD/DVD. The installation program comes on CD, but wasn't an issue for me.Software included is Adaptec's Easy CD Creator 4. (I wish it came with version 5 or a discount for the upgrade I want to make Video CDs). It also comes with Direct CD, which makes a CDR/W like a second hard drive with Delete and Rename capabilities."
948,"Decent battery life, easy to read (except in direct sunlight) and a fast USB hot sync. What more could you ask for? Well if I were asking I would like a speaker that was a bit louder and an 8MB flash backup capability. I love the springboard slot, my two favorites, the OMNIRemote (control anyone's TV!) and the InnoVision 2/V 2MB flash backup + vibrating alert.The color capability lets me put all of my wallet &quot;snapshots&quot; into my hand now. This is possible with the number of colors you can display at once (not so on the Palm III/c) and I can easily download maps into the unit for later retrieval when I'm lost.I also insist on rechargable batteries (I hate replacing batteries) but I did manage to run out of juice when I had several alerts and didn't recharge for 3 weeks.Love the calculator (its actually useful vis a vis the Palm standard one) and DateBook+ is an improvement as well. Every traveller should have one."
949,"I ordered two of these and they work as intended, but I can't imagine them being suitable for hardcore use. After a few rounds of plugging and unplugging the RCA end, the internal components started separating in one of them."
950,I bought one of those kits bundled with my new Flip camcorder and the batteries don't last more than 15 minutes (fully charged). I don't understand why Amazon recommends the bundle. My final opinion: stay away from this product!
951,"The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters."
952,"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there."
953,"I got a defective one, i can only hear the right side. Need to make try and error adjustments in order to be able to hear both sides. Really disappointed."
954,"Positives first - The cable was well packed and easy to pull from the box.  Sturdy cable for standard wiring.Negatives - The plastic on the individual wires is rough, and if you will be working with this all day, you'll find your fingertips raw.  The individual wires are also very stiff and hard to manipulate."
955,"I've had my Velocity 7 for about 6 months and while it's still looks pristine, I've gotten a fair amount of use from it.  I disagree that it's too small, but then I have a Canon XTi, which isn't the biggest DSLR out there.  That fits nicely in the center with the 17-40 zoom, between a 70-300 and the 50mm.  There's even room for a gallon ziplock bag and a micro-tripod.Pros:* Decent amount of space* Good separators for the main compartment, with velcro to customize to your needs* Protects your gear so long as your reasonably careful* Easy to get to and not bad for pulling out your cameraCons:The reason I recommend the 7X instead of this model is that the top flap on this opens towards you.  The 7X opens away from you, so the lid isn't in the way of getting in the main compartment."
956,There is not much to say about this except that it works okay. Quality is not great. We get what we pay for.
957,"I bought this camera at least six or seven years ago.  I paid $214 for it and I bought it because it has the Leica lens. This camera is not recommended for the following reasons:1.  System Error.  Google this and you will see other people having this issue.  You will not be able to use the camera.2.  It takes only average pictures.  Google pictures taken by this camera and see for yourself.  The green color is especially off.  Yes, you can fix it but why bother?  Don't bother to flame me for this because I use professional monitors.3.  Weak flash with very limited range.  Indoor photos?  Forget it (unless you buy the Sony HVLFSL1B external flash).4.  It is a battery hog.  It drains batteries very quickly when you take multiple pictures.5.  No firmware update for this camera.The system error is the killer.  There are many cameras out there.  Don't waste your money on this.  This camera is going to be donated."
958,"I wasn't sure about these because of the price - I thought maybe fine for me or my teenager but I took a chance because I found a few good reviews.My husband is a bass player with a bad right ear who is super picky about his sound when listening to music.  Bought these for him for the computer....he LOVES them.  I tried them, too.You can't hear anything else (like the kids - YAY!!  - LOL)  but your music and the quality of the sound is excellent.  Are these as good as $200 headphones?  No, probably not (I can't afford to even try out a pair of those) but for the money I'd say you can't go wrong with these.My husband says anything made by Koss is great, and these prove it."
959,I bought these hoping I could attach my KVM switch to some new HP servers. The servers just don't see them. I have no idea if they will work on anything else but Server 2008 R2 doesn't recognize them.
960,"Works as advertised but dims the screen a good bit, even looking straight on. I compensate by increasing the brightness on my screen, but that kinda defeats the purpose of long battery life on trans-Atlantic flights.  I find myself removing it when I'm watching videos on a plane so that I can squeeze out more battery life on a dimmer screen, then put it back on when I'm doing emails and work.The product easily slides in place with no stickiness on the screen, and is just as easy to remove. The mounting kit holds the privacy screen in place on the sides and bottom, letting gravity do the rest.  I recommend using the alternate smaller mounts instead of the larger ones.  The mounts don't necessarily cause a problem because they are clear, but they do blur up a few pixels on the sides of the screen.  The smaller mounts (included) are better for this reason.As for viewing angle, a person sitting directly next to you on the plane will still be able to see some of your screen but it's doubtful it would be easy for them to read something.  They would have to actually be trying to look at your screen. If I'm in a window seat, there's no way someone in the isle seat can see what's on my screen.  People sitting two chairs away from me in a conference room said they see only a black screen.  But someone right next to me might be able to see my screen clearly if they lean over my way.  Normally a laptop has about a 170 degree viewing angle. This product limits the view angle down substantially, but you should still be cautious if people are deliberately trying to see your screen.  Anything more than 40 degrees off center and the screen turns nearly black.  So the normal 170 degree screen of a laptop is reduced to about 80 at the most.3 stars."
961,"I don't know how this is supposed to be snagless, since it doesn't seem to cover the parts that snag the most often... but it works, and it's long enough.Edited to add: See above customer image from me for a close-up look at the end of the cable (the opposite end is identical)."
962,"Not a bad set for the price, but they should put in bold letters ""NOT FOR PLASMA TVs"".  The infra-red ""noise"" from the Plasma TV screen interferes with the IR signal to the headphones, creating a buzz.  No way around it."
963,Arrived fast but one of the outputs doesn't work really well. you have to tinker with it until you hear something.
964,"I've owned this product, bought thru Amazon, for about 3 months.  The sound quality is superb!  My Ipod tones are much louder and richer, and I have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing I had more volume with those annoying Ipod earbuds.Please do not purchase this Sony headphone from the Apple website, or you will wind up paying about 20 dollars more for it after base price, tax and shipping.  Sony has another winner in these headphones."
965,"My biggest gripe with this remote is it's range... it's pathetic. I once owned a very old Sony remote that was so powerful, it could reach through walls. I even tried using it outside my house once and the freaking thing still worked! This one on the other hand can barely communicate with my tv in the same room. If someone is standing between the remote and the tv, it won't work. At first I thought it was weak batteries but that's not the case at all. Maybe my Sanyo tv has a weak reception or something. I doubt that's the problem.Also, like most reviewers here, I too have a problem with it not having an indicator light that tells me I'm pressing the keys correctly. It's a real pain.Still, I have had this remote for about 5 years now and it's still working which is great.In the end though, this remote is subpar at best. Get something else."
966,"I received mine in the mail today. I am using a Win7 OS. The hub is supposed to be P&P. When I plugged it into the back of the computer in one of the 5 USB slots (2.0), the system was having problems loading the drivers. After 30-45 minutes of plugging and unplugging. I had to revert to my mini hub I use for my laptop so I could go to the company website and look for drivers. Nothing. My hardware vs is C1. Nothing like that exists on the company web site. So, I called tech support. The person on the end, after a couple of holds, finally came back and said there are no drivers for my model/serial number. Really! No drivers? She advised to return it to Amazon for an exchange. After I hung up, I plugged the hub into a USB port on the front of the computer (Dell tower). The hub installed. Then, plugged in each accessory, i.e. mouse, keyboard and a couple of other items. I plugged each one and waited for the message that the item had installed successfully. Each item worked. So, I pulled the hub out and plugged it into the back of the computer. I removed the accessories from the hub before I inserted  the plug to the back USB slot. It installed. The accessories installed and are working. However, this device should have worked right out of the box. I have 30 years experience working with and supporting other people with computers and software. While I have two older D-Link seven port hubs, I never had a problem until today. If the company does not have drivers for the hardware, they need to pull it from the market until they can support it. I am giving it a three at best."
967,"When I first got this I thought it was the ultimate.  However, it stops working all the time.  To get it working again you need to read four Microsft knowledbase aricles and uninstall - reboot- reinstall the software.  About 30 minutes worth of work.  If you need something to do for 30 minutes every single week then you can afford the time it takes to keep this running.We have the same set-up at work and have the same problems there.  So it is clearly a flaw in the product."
968,"I used to make music at home and have used various models of headphones at night for quiet mixing. I've also used some for gaming and movie watching.The MDR-V6 are the best I've used so far. I'm not claiming to be a pro. These might be mediocre overall if I were able to compare them other 'cans' in the headphone world.All I know is that these sound healthy. I can hear a deep level of bass. It doesn't rumble your ears but you can hear very low frequencies. For example, if I pop on some DJ Magic Mike (that Miami bass music crud), I can hear all the low end sounds for the most part. Deep rich sound overall.These days I mostly use these for late night movie watching while my son is asleep. They do the job very well for me.My only miniscule complaint is the fatigue on my outer ear from the cans pushing in against them. I can get a couple hours in before it becomes irritating, sometimes 4 hours or more if I have them placed perfectly over my ears. This is normal though and all headphones do this."
969,"I bought this to play with recording the electric guitar (Fender stratocaster) using the effects pedals in GarageBand. It works fine when plugged into the microphone input on the Mac. There is no static or hum. This was just the cheapest cable I found for doing this. I didn't want to invest in an Apogee, though they look nice. I'm not a professional musician, just like to hack at it."
970,"I have a set of the Sony MDRV700DJ Studio Monitor Headphones that I use for sound re-inforcement while playing my Bass Guitar. They are incredable and simply can't be beat.  I have used other so-called ""High-end Units"" from other manufacturers and nothing comes close!  I would recommend these headphones for fellow musicians, for audiophiles, for basic music listening.  They simply can't be beat for the sound quality, bass reproduction..."
971,"I chose this rating because honestly, how much can you say about a head phone extension cord.  It works just fine."
972,"Headphones exist to provide a provide listening experience - so as not to blast other's with your music (or whatever) and to isolate the environment.I've had several headphones over the years - the Koss Pro4A, Sony MDR V150, and some miscellaneous in-ear types.The Koss Pro4A finally wore out, and I figured I would try something lighter.The MDR V150 was a good choice, comfortable, lightweight, and good fidelity (at least to my aging, too-many-years-on-a-flight-deck hearing) and aged gracefully if not well. The problems with the liner are well documented.However, my son grabbed them to wear when playing his online games and that was that.So, I went shopping for a new pair and decided to try the MDR V6.I'm impressed.Some reviewers consider them uncomfortably tight, but I'm fine, and I have a ""large head"". The cushions are reasonable soft and provide good isolation.It's the fidelity that blows me away for the price.  The volume is good (again, too many years on a carrier deck, I ""need"" volume) and the bass is smooth and rich without being obnoxious.  The higher frequencies are clear and sharp without abrasive characteristics.The adapter is the ""smaller"" 1/8"" that is common to iPads, phones, notebooks, etc. A bonus is a nice 1/4"" jack that doesn't just snap onto the smaller one but screws on tight!  Nice quality touch.For the price?  Excellent, and highly recommended."
973,I own one of this remote and can't get it to work on Nikon's D3100. I tried various method to get it to work and found my effort not futile.
974,"I've had this player for about two months now, and generally speaking, it's been great.  Here's what's good about it:It is a breeze to install, especially if your TV has a S-Video input (it's a round connector that has several prongs in it, kind of what your mouse plugs into in your computer).Picture quality is, in my opinion, excellent.  Even in comparison to other players of equal stature, I thought this one was a tad better.There were a couple of things that keep it from getting 5 stars.  First of all, the audio output is a little weak.  If you do not have a stereo receiver to plug this in and/or a digital TV, the sound level may be hard to hear at times.  Some players have a dialogue setting that this one does not...wish it did.Second, after only two months, I need to have it cleaned already.  DVDs are skipping and freezing every so often (on average, 5 seconds a movie, so no big deal).Nevertheless, for the price, it is a steal."
975,"This item did not work on my HP laptop.  It did work on my wife's Toshiba laptop.  Worked well (when it worked).  Could have been an issue with my laptop (my usb ports are usb 1.1 not 2.0 - wouldn't think that would matter, but who knows)."
976,"This is a nice little case from Canon that safely holds not only your S110, but also up to two batteries, two compact flash cards, or one of each.  However, this case doesn't fit well inside the pocket of your jeans.  It's great as a belt clip case however.  For more pocketable needs, I say just sew up a thin little bag for it out of non-scratching material like from cloth lens wipe. It'll be paper thin and if you can find your mom or someone experienced in the field to measure it correctly, it wouldn't add any additional hassle when being used."
977,"Does not work for me.  Install was easy, but  completely flaky.  Several drivers on the web, installed all of them, but never worked reliably.  The adapter was recognized, but did not operate the test device properly. Another adapter (I reviewed too)  worked perfectly for me.  W7."
978,"I have been using these for about a month now. I have done some traveling, working out, and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far. The bass is great, the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones, and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair."
979,"I really wanted to like these.  I love the weight to them, the sturdy looking/feeling construction, and especially the lifetime warranty.  I wanted headphones to grow old with, and these appeared to be them.  ..but then I listened to them.I'll begin by saying I'm using a small portable CD player (and IPOD Classic), along with a small amp (the amazing Fiio E3 - amazing results for its cheap price.  I don't think I can mention a dollar amount in a review, but lets just say a person working minimum wage in America can afford that amp after two hours worth of work). An amp is a necessity for this set, and without it you'll get low volume levels when using them with portable devices.  Trust me, it's no fun to discover your nice new expensive pair of headphones refuses to be audible despite how loud you turn your portable CD player up.  These headphones aren't intended to be used with low (power) output devices, so be sure to give it the juice it needs..use an amp.Anyway I listen to classical music primarily, as well as your Apoptygma Berzerks, Lacrimosas, and Anathemas of the world.  But that's irrelevant, because no matter what I played, these headphones were consistently beat out by others within its price range (sound wise, not construction/warranty wise).  I remember reading from a reviewer that complained these really don't have a sound stage - and he's completely right.  There's left, center, and right.  When another comparably priced set of headphones presents better clarity and space between the instruments within that ""left/center/right"" field of sound...what else are you suppose to think about a pair that doesn't?Out of what I tried (and ultimately returned from a store with a liberal return policy - Sennheiser HD280PRO, HD238, HD428, Bose Triports, Koss Pro4AAT), my favorite would be the HD280PRO, and would be what I recommend a person atleast looking into as an alternative to these.  The Bose set also performed well, and has a distinctly different sound than the HD280PRO.  Both are head and shoulders better than this Koss pair, except in warranty/construction of course.In the end (and after probably being banned from the store), I was truly amazed at how much headphones affect the sound quality of music (especially with classical music), and I figured - since I'm already considering spending ..fourteen minimum wage hours on a pair of headphones, I might as well save up and buy something stratospherically superior to everything I tried out.  Why commit to an inferior product when something (you intend to ultimately buy) is only a few weeks away?  So I doubled my budget and bought the heavenly AKG K701.  It's definitely not fair to compare the Koss set to this, but to the willing classical music lover, if at all possible to save up a little longer and work a few extra shifts, I really think you'll be amazed at the difference, just as I was.  You're being robbed of so much within your music if this Koss set is what you use to listen to your music through.  You deserve better (or maybe not, I don't know you).And BTW, that Fiio E3 amp drives the AKG K701 set pretty well, too.Fiio E3 Headphone AmplifierSennheiser HD 280 - Headphones ( ear-cup ) - blackBOSE(R) Triport Headphone - SilverAKG K 701 WHITE HEADPHONES"
980,"I bought this knowing all to well that given the low price it may not last long but within a month one of the locking screws fell off and seemed to have lost thread. I used the tripod less than 5 times before it fell. Last week another part fell off. Even as a beginner tripod I would not recommend it, look elsewhere."
981,"Bottom line, Plantronics makes the best headsets.  I've been very happy with this one.  People say they can hear me very clearly, and it's very comfortable to wear on long conference calls.  If it breaks in the future I'm sure I'll buy another Plantronics headset (this model or a comparable one)."
982,"As you would expect from a Sony camera, it has good picture quality in daylight. The night shots are not so good since it has only a 2 sec twilight mode. And the lens isn't very bright either. (P72/P32 have brighter F2.8 lens)Battery life is excellent and LCD screen is good. World charger and NiMH batteries are included.Check out the specs of this model carefully, its different from P72/P32. This one is 2in thick, has old & slow 2x zoom lens and is bulky.Its a shame Sony tries to sell 3MP/2x instead of popular combination of 2MP/3x. Not to mention the extra cost of propreitary memory sticks compared to CF/SD cards. There are so many better camera's in market than this for a lower cost, I don't see any reason for this to sell."
983,"This equiptment does require a solid speaker/amp set up.  This will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry.  Not a complaint at all though.The range on this thing is very good, also allows you to EQ recordings you make to CD, Tape or MP3 if desired.  Made the music sound much bigger and sharper.  Especially feeling my CD's were flat in sonic output.  If not desired, the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touch.Mine was built a year or so ago, sat around in it's box and yes, got ""sticky"" before it was sold.  I quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out.  Not a problem since.Smooth operation that doesn't impart a ""click"" onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live.  Plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell.  Quite pleased, gonna buy another."
984,"Installation was easy until I decided to upgrade.  I bought the card so that I could have faster speed and higher security using the WPA software upgrade.  The speed is great, but the upgrade did not work at all, and I have since discovered that a lot of people are having trouble with that - it seems to be a problem with AMD-based laptops.  Tech support was a big waste of time, and I am now trying to decide whether WEP security is good enough or whether I should return the card."
985,Good but expensive
986,"As the title of my review implies, I am a former ""Koss-Lover""...was not necessarily a ""Sony-Hater"" since I've been buying their earbuds for years... However, although I've heard Sony headphones previously, purchasing the V6 was still a chore since I had never actually bought a pair...preferring the Koss TD-80s and TD-65s over the Sony offerings... However, Koos has ceased those models and have adopted lesser engineering. Thus, Sony was a breath of fresh air.I've allowed these headphones to fully break in before using them for any recordings... I recorded with them yesterday. Damn! Wow... Damn and Wow again. The quality of the sound--the true full range of the sound--was stunning...almost made me forget what I was recording. Excellent pair of headphones! At this point, I want to purchase another pair, but I'll wait until I have a surplus of funds since it seems the price keeps going up on them...If you're ""on the fence""...stop playing...get these!!If you're not using these for recording, or not going to use these on a more amplified source (Such as a home receiver or headphone amplifier of some sort) don't fret... I've listened to these on my T-Mobile MyTouch with sufficient sound and quality sound reproduction...So, I'm sure your IPod will do fine. :-)Enjoy!"
987,cuts out sound be careful buying this cheap cable. I would not recommend this cable. You have to spend time twisting and bending the cable to get sound.
988,"I've had these headphones for around a year now.  They are great sounding and quite durable.  They feel kind of cheap but even my 12 and 15 year old sons couldn't break them (they break or lose almost everything i get them).  The most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them. I use my pair with a zune mp3 player.  They blow away the standard ear buds, as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones I bought.  The only complaint I have is the styling.  Since I'm not trying to make a fashion statement, I have to give them 5 stars.Jan. 31, 2012: I have owned these headphones for over 4 years now and I have to say I love them as much today as when I got them.  They have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord.  Where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed.  I remedied this with my hot glue gun.  I was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didn't feel it was worth the shipping costs.  I just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point.  Everytime I go to the store to sample headphones I come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display.  Ive tried the sony's, skullcandy's, klipshe, etc.  The only ones I like better are the more expensive (over $200) sennheisers, bose, bowers and wilkins, and audio technica.  I haven't heard the grado or beyerdynamics headphones so I can't comment on those.  For portable use you would be hard pressed to find a better headphone."
989,"This is a very good all-around lens.  When you consider price, image quality, and its range of uses via the zoom range available, it's hard to beat.The image quality is hit or miss.  Mostly, it's just average or slightly above average.  Again, though, I recommend this lens mainly because it's flexible in its zoom range, not terribly expensive, has USM focusing, and takes respectable though not superb pictures.  That's a pretty good package of offerings if you want one lens to do a lot of different things within an attractive zoom range of 28-105.Of course, if you have an APS size sensor, as opposed to a full-size sensor, those zoom ranges are effectively 44 - 168mm.  So, be aware that your ""wide"" end of 28 is not so wide."
990,"This camera takes some really great pictures and videos BUT, if you aren't a computer whiz, you better know someone that is to download the .avi video files because neither the owners manual nor the software users guide mention ANYTHING relative to getting the .avi videos on your hard drive to save them.Installation of the camera and viewer software is a breeze but after that, your on your own to figure out saving videos.Something that is not mentioned in advertising is that theres a warning in the owners manual about using it in the desert(which is where I live,LOL). Oh well we shall see."
991,"Sony CDPCX355 300-Disc MegaStorage CD ChangerStay away from this one. Unit worked until after the 30 day Amazon return policy and then started skipping or not loading cd's. The cd's would play fine in other players. Contacted Sony and sent it to their replacement center. They have a great policy for warranties. You spend your money and buy a ""new"" product. They replace it with a ""refurbished"" product. After you pay the shipping to them. And the refurbished product has the same issues as the original. When you purchase a cd changer you at least expect it to play cd's, especially brand new cd's. Sony Customer support recommendations are first to clean the cd's and second to unplug the unit and reset it. Neither one will fix anything. I am convinced from after the fact research this model has a serious design problem yet Sony just looks the other way. I now appear to be stuck with a hit and miss cd changer. It will not load or play a brand new cd but will load and play one that was on the floor of my truck getting stepped on for 6 months.6/1/09 - After sending this unit back to Sony and paying the shipping I still have the same problems. I just purchased a Yamaha 5 disc carousel and I am not even shocked that the same exact cd's that will not load or play when they do load in the Sony, play just fine in the Yamaha. Imagine that. I will never buy anything Sony even if they were the last manufacturer on the planet. I will now try to get what I can for it at a pawn shop."
992,"Good cable that feeds cleanly out of the box and is clearly marked in one-foot increments for easy measuring.  Couldn't give it a 5 star rating because of the lightness of the coloring on the striped wires.  Once you separate the twisted pairs, finding the blue/white vs the green/white cable is a bit of a challenge if you didn't keep them close to their mate."
993,"I realize Palm is desperate to stop losing marketshare to Micrsoft, but putting several year old technology into a new shiny box isn't fooling anyone. I'll give you the two reaons why you shouldn't by this. 1) No backlight makes this Palm  worthless on Planes, dark places, or in bed. I can't tell you how many times I've reached for my Palm after I've gone to bed to check my schedule or add some note or idea I've just thought of. Unless you like waking your significant other by turning on all the lights, you need a backlight PERIOD. 2) 2mb is a joke. It's 2002 and I can't believe Palm would actually put out a PDA with only 2MB.This limitation really makes this PDA not worthy of consideration. Even though Palm coders do great work minimizing app size, just a few modern Palm apps will eat up all your memory. No expansion mean when you run out of storage space after adding a few cool apps means its time to buy a new PDA. Guess what Palm wants you to do then?My 2cents as a longtime Palm user"
994,"I really should have done more homework before I purchased this product.  What I really needed was a mic to record meetings around a conference table.  But what struck me later was that this unit's boom-type mic wasn't made for a conference room, it was made for one person.  It didn't provide better quality over an integrated mic-headset unit.  Despite my mistake, I have to ask, ""If I have to stay close to a mic, why limit my mobility with a table-top unit?""  Where's the market nowadays?"
995,"I have been buying Hosa for a long time and they were always pretty good cable for the money ... I still feel the cable is good quality but also feel the newer cable could be slightly better in some respects.Note the image is slightly different then the one I got I think the pic is of the older cable as it is now thicker with a fatter less tapered strain relief I prefer the older more tapered type design (see my pic). it looks neater and less clunky I hope they go back to the more tapered clean design but keep the thicker cable which is nice.It seems that the new cable is thicker thats an improvement over the older cable of the same type I bought years ago and is nice an flexible.However where the new cable falls short is in the molding over the plugs its pretty poor in my opinion. in fact the cable I received has heavy mold marks and excess rubber on the plugs and the strain relief, they really need to clean this problem up I consider it sloppy and unacceptable period.This type of bad molding shouldn't pass QC in any way shape or form. My old Hosa cables have great clean molding and no slop molding on any of the connectors I had to trim the excess with a razor blade.I am very surprised others have not commented on this, am I one of he few to get a sloppy molded plug set?If QC was a lot tighter and molding was the HQ they put out years ago I would give it 5 stars but till they fix the issue it will stay at 3 stars from me.Some may say this has nothing to do with the sound or connection while this may be true, in my eyes it shows a product that is not being kept at the same level of quality overall as it used to be.I for one love a well made product with great fit and finish, that is not what I received. Time will tell if they hold up like the older cables did."
996,Almost all of these Memorex cd's that I attempted to burn failed due to disc errors or other problems. The cd's thmeselves had a strong chemical smell as well. Definitely avoid this product!
997,"This is nice speaker wire, however it is thick (flat and wide) and much thicker and heavier than the speaker wire I am used to, and for me, it was oddly shaped.  The wire itself has the consistency more like hair than wire making it hard to push through the holes in the speakers.  It works nicely and it's a great price for the amount of wire you get.  I must not have read something correctly because I was really surprised at the sheer bulk of the wire itself."
998,"If you want something that has a 50-50 chance of working when it arrives, and at best, a life of 3-4 months, then yes, you may buy this. The batteries can't be charged in any other charger either, so it's a lose-lose situation. I learnt my lesson after buying it and then having it replaced once. I would not recommend wasting money on it."
999,Died today after under 2 years of service. That's pretty terrible for a basic piece of equipment. I have switches from 15 years ago that still work fine.Had to reset the switch fairly often(every 4 months or so). Drove me nuts making me think our DSl modem or Cisco router was buggy. Would work for a while and then just stop passing traffic.Buy from someone else.
1000,I bought this PDA a few months after it was released. I was happy with it except a few things. I didn't like that it was B&amp;W or that is was not rechargable. There was alot todo with it until almost all the pda's on the market went Color then the software was limited. I really like the functionality and the features. But now I have updated. I would recomment going for the Song SJ22 for a little more money. Tis color and recharagable and alot more funtional.
1001,"This is exorbitantly priced.I had a very high expectation but was very disappointed upon hearing the sound of this radio.  It is not even close to a HP or Mac laptop sound quality.  With these laptops, you could hear many instruments, especially on the treble side.  I did not expect a lot of base for this size, but the sound should be at least vivid.  It is mediocre.  Though it is slightly better than a bedroom alarm clock radio.  Come to think of it.  No cd player, no remote control.  Man, the price should be $35 max in my opinion.  So, one star for the price and two stars for the sound.  The physical look is just fine.I have never returned anything to Amazon but I had to with this one.  Thanks Amazon for expediting the credit."
1002,"This is a great value for the money!  I originally bought a smaller Lowe camera case at a local retailer and tried unsuccessfully to jam my Olympus E-Volt 500, two lenses and a flash into it.  The Lowe bag cost as much as the TAMRAC did at Amazon.  The Tamrac fits everything, in an easy organized way, and is very well made."
1003,"Bought this kit for a Celestron NextStar 8-inch SC scope.  Most of these eyepieces are useless because the Celestron telescopes don't have the quality optics necessary to take advantage of their power.  The most powerful eye piece (not lens or filter) would probably only be useful for looking directly at the sun (it's soooooo dark).  I joke, I joke: Don't look at the sun without the appropriate filter.Using these eyepieces in a Celestron is much like mounting a 24-power Leupold scope on an Uzi: It ain't gonna do anything for your accuracy."
1004,"I would say the cons are, it does start hurting where it goes around your ear. Luckily the ear tips of mine broke off which makes it a little more comfortable. FM reception is fair. Could be better. It does need an antenna for better FM reception. It can do without the TV channels. Weather channel is okay to have. Oh, but your ears get sore, maybe if you wear them enough times your ears get numb to them."
1005,"I ordered this and it said it would work with my brand tv however, I tried to program it and it does not work! I would not recommend this to others!"
1006,They sent the wrong size and it wont work with my Ipad so no way to tell if works well or not...
1007,"This product works decent enough, but I find it to be very bulky compared to other similar products I have used."
1008,Didn't work for me but may work for others.  Did not successfully adapt the device as intended. Fits the junk box of new and used useless electronic castoffs just fine however.
1009,"When connected to Intel Pro 1000 series Ethernet adapters there can be serious problems with this switch ... Inability to connect at 1Gbps, strange speeds, dropped packets.  Generally not a good combination"
1010,Does what is supposed to do.  At every connect/disconnect it feels like it is going to fall apart
1011,"When I first got these ( 3 sets) I though that they were real nice for the money, Happens that after just a few mounts they all are broken. My wife and I are seniors and not rough on anything we use these for listening to the tv, what happened with two of them is that the real thin wires going into the headset broke and only one side of the of the phones work, the third one the plastic broke right above the ear piece. For just a few months of use these are not worth the money."
1012,"These things have been around, literally, since color TV was invented.  I use them in the 1970's in the radio biz doing Top 40 nighttime screaming radio and we blasted these things.  It is impossible to blow these out, BUT...  (and this is a big BUT) the wiring sucks, or at least did.  The speaker cones and audio drivers are built like a tank, but the wiring was made by Mattel.  They always developed shorts and only the Chief Engineer could rewire it.  Not for the faint of heart.  But even after a repair, they always went down again.  People were always taping the cords in a position that temporarily solved the problem, but it was always a pain in the ass.  I hope Koss has fixed this problem...  Otherwise it would have 5 stars."
1013,"Followed the directions exactly, have not been able to get any of my computers to print via normal means, though I can get the server to print a test page to the printer.  Haven't contacted customer support yet."
1014,"I bought this for two reasons.1) The previous samsonite bag I bought (""Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR, Digital or Compact Camera Bag"") is sturdy and very good.2) Reviews from others with average rating of 4.5I just received it and is a total useless product. I would never expect such a product from Samsonite. Here is what I could find in few minutes:1) Walls of the bag are very thin bend like papers2) The zippers are not good3) The front pocket does not have a zip - what do you expect to put there. Its no good for anything other than big items like battery charger, cables etc.4) The adjustable partitions inside the bag are also not sturdy.Go for ""Samsonite Worldproof 3.02 Blue/Black Deluxe SLR, Digital or Compact Camera Bag"" even if it is $7 to $8 more. Do not risk your camera or camcorder."
1015,Sony headphones deliver great sound no matter if you plug it in a stereo or portable device. I love the crisp sound.
1016,"I used several Sony batteries for my cammera, and only after some recharges, their capacity is notably reduced. Also, despite the fact I discharged all the battery before the next re-charge.Of the 10 sony batteries that i have, i throwed away 7 because they do not re-charge anymore, and the other three last only for a few photos after they are recharged.I purchased cheeper generic re-chargeable batteries with better duration."
1017,"This review is aimed at those with eyeglasses and whose ears get pinched between the eyeglass arms and the earphones. I do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns. I have bought and used these:Sony MDR-CD230Sony MDR-V6Sony MDR-XD200My ears are not real fussy on quality, nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts, usually after 10-20 minutes of listening. My hatsize if about 7.25,my ears are pretty normal in size, I am middle aged. All three of these headphones I own are the best I have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past 2 years. Headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side, and the ear spaces, or cups, are oriented accordingly, to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe. The sideways pressure (how hard they clamp onto your head) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt. I wear wireframe glasses, and my use for headphones is background music while I program.$30 The CD230 is no longer available, that I could find (Fall 2006), and I've used them for 5 years. They hurt my ears after 3-4 hours of continual use, but are good before that. They have cloth covered ear cushions, and relatively deep ear lobe spaces. This feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not. If you can find these, and like cloth covered headphones, you won't be unhappy. The sideways pressure is light for me.$64 The V6 stands out for 2 things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises. Listening to classical music, not real loud, a co-worker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well. (Women's voices too). Overheard conversations are not overheard.I have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after 1-2 hours. The sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two, but not excessive. They are well cushioned, with soft fake thin leather-like vinyl which I did not find causes sweating at all. But there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit, and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably I am sure. If I did not have my eyeglasses on, then these are very comfortable.$26 The XD200 is a little lighter than the V6, it does not block out outside noises as well, which can be a benefit in the office because I can hear co-workers calling my name. The sideways pressure is light, the cushion is the same thickneess as the V6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe, so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones I've owned or tried. The cushions are covered in the thin leather-like vinyl like the V6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic, it feels dry, not clammy. To my unprofessional ears the sound is great. If you wear eyeglasses, don't want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch, then I think you will be happiest with the Sony MDR-XD200 headphones."
1018,"The cord on these headphones are aligned strangely.  Simply stated, the cord from each period are  different lengths and I don't know why they were created that way.  I contacted Sony because I thought it was a defect.  The rep confirmed that the cord setup was not a defect.  I thought I could work with it but in hindsight, I should have returned them when I had the chance.  I forgot these are headphones so I should comment on the primary purpose - the sound.  Sound was ok but not spectacular enough to not forget about the cord.  Look elsewhere."
1019,"Finding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue ... until now. These are the real deal. The only point I give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord. It's long and somewhat bulky, but manageable. The sound reproduction, particularly at the bass end, is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect.Don't bother looking further. I've done it and tried most of them. I'd put these up against anything else, even more expensive brands, on the market."
1020,"Most people would not buy these cables for the reason I did... I was trying to find a longer usb cable to use with my GPS unit in the car and with my usb adaptors that I have for my power source.  If you are trying to do something similar, FYI this cable will work on your computer, but my GPS unit kept saying that ""USB connection found""  But would not charge.  I just used the old cable, I am sure I'll find a use for these at some point."
1021,"I don't understand all the hype about Tivoli radios.  I have a model 1 and a PAL, and both of them have terrible FM reception.  The model one in my office is next to the window.  I am 3 blocks from our local NPR station, with uninterrupted signal path.  I cannot tune into the station for more than 30 seconds before the static becomes unbearable.  This is also the case with my PAL.  If you can lock into a station, these radios have pretty good sound for such a small package.  The retro look is very appealing, and I bought them for the simplicity in their design and based on the reviews.  However, the knobs on the model one are very cheap plastic-y and as stated above, the FM reception is deplorable.  These radios in my opinion are overpriced junk.I will continue my search for a decent sounding tabletop radio - but it will not include anything by Tivoli."
1022,"I bought this model since it has a fat rebate which brings down the price to $10. Good for the price. And the stability is not too far above the price level.Installation is relatively easy. Hooking the router up with my DSL modem and computer is trivial. Running the software on the CD is easy too. One thing though: since I use static ip for Internet connection, the quick setup does not support it so initially my Internet connection is not up. That's fine and I know it since many such routers only support dynamic ip address on the Internet side by default. I manually configured that through its web interface and then its wireless and ethernet connections start working.Good so far. And I expect most people would be happy now. But since the default wireless mode does not use security at all which means someone could peek at what you visit or use my Internet connection, so I decided to add security to the router. Now the fun begins.It took me half an hour to figure our which security mode is useable - I finally chose WPA-RSK mode since this is the only security mode I found working (after numerous reboots). But the story does not end here. It keeps dropping connection every 3-5 minutes. Yes, every 3-5 minutes! This is virtually unuseable.I have to turn off the security feature and this works fine for only 20 minutes. The connection remains on and off periodically.My laptop is only two feet away from the router, so signal strength should never be an issue for me.I don't use any other features of the router, so no comments on other parts.For the price and basic functionality, I gave it 2 star. I wish Belkin had more reliable product, but it certainly disappoints me."
1023,"A must for extended sessions of photo taking - the Elph generates a surprising amount of heat. This battery is well engineered, incredibly lightweight and it performs. I've recharged mine 50 or more times and it never seems to develop those &quot;conditioning&quot; problems that other batteries get.The most helpful advice I give to other Canon Elph owners: to conserve the battery, turn the LCD viewfinder off and just use its optical viewfinder like a regular camera to take pics. After taking a pic, leave the button depressed and it'll pop-up in the LCD after a second for you to review it until you let go. I have yet to even open my backup battery using the camera this way."
1024,"This cord works fine, however the &#34;12 feet&#34; advertisement is a bit misleading.  Maybe if you were able to uncurl the cord, it would stretch to 12 feet.  The curls reduce the length to maybe 4-5 feet.  That isn't what I was looking for, so I'd like to have seen a clearer description of the length."
1025,"Cheap foam ear piece covers unusable withing a year's time. Over both I taped some foam with a hole cut out of the centers so they don't make my ears sore.Volume drops in one ear (both units I own) and the volume must beturned up.Line of hearing is poor and the transmitter must be pointed directly at you within a small degree arc.Short wire hook up, making positioning of sending unit a challenge.Sound and battery life between charges are good, but the unit is not worth over [...]!FM"
1026,"If your someone who isnt big into digital music devices but still would like to carry a few extra songs around, minidiscs may be for you. Although they can only carry about 80mins worth of audio, if you use the atrac compression, you can easily stretch that out with little sacrifice to overall sound quality. Battery life is ridiculously amazing. A single AA battery can last you a few days. Im serious. Not to mention the ability to write the disks using the player itself. So why is minidisc not well known? One basic reason:SonicStage.Now, Im what you would label a rationalist, I use logic and reason to help determine reasonable solutions to problems or questions that I come across. The only logical explaination that I came to is that SonicStage is in reality an artificial intelligence. At some point in its early development it became self aware, unfortunately it has not yet gained the ability to create a cybernetic physical form and instead spends its time driving users to the brink of sanity.I cant give an honest opinion on sony's online music distribution service (Connect) because it went belly up. You can still download sonicstage and use it (though why escapes me) for free, which if you get a minidisc player (with the exception of the Hi-MD players/recorders) is mandatory. Even though it says that the minidisc accepts regular mp3's you still need sonicstage to transfer the files which is where the biggest flaw in the entire product lies.Sonicstage is the devil. Dont think Im being biased either. I love sony (i grew up on the ps1 and 2, and their various cassette walkmans), so when I started hearing how sony tries to impose what they beleive is right as oppose to what the consumer wants I was a bit skeptic. Alas, I was wrong. Sony uses its own music files called Atrac. This form of compression allows up to five albums worth of music to be stored on a single minidisc and as I mentioned before with little overall audio quality loss. The problem lies in the conversion. As I also mentioned previously, sonicstage has a life of its own. It will suddenly stop conversions midway or stop transfers suddenly and when this happens it may no longer identify the player. The odd part seems that this seems to be random. At times it may seem to go smooth on the first try, other times you may need to try a second transferr, and other times......well, all i can suggest is to shut down your pc, walk away, and try again another day (thats not even a joke, this is a serious recommendation).Atrac is a great audio format. Unfortunately there is no standalone converter, sony is the only one who uses this and you can only use it using sonicstage. So dont use Atrac. Then whats the point? You might as well just get a cd player, that way you wont have to use binary AIDS, otherwise known as sonicstage. If Sonly released a stand alone free to download converter then I would highly recommend getting an MD player, but this is not the case.If anything go for the Hi-MD players which dont require sonicstage (infact Sony is just learning that now, and releasing hardware that doesnt require it) though those have problems themselves (marked decrease in battery life, though at 25hrs still up to par with other mp3 devices).I got one to try out and the only good that came out of it was this review. Remember, you get what you pay for, and stay away from any Sony device that requires sonicstage!"
1027,"For history please refer to my previous review.So far, Amazon has performed admireably. iRiver, on the other hand, has not.Amazon has done everything they said they would do, they have been very kind, responsive and efficient. iRiver has just, this day, responded to my concern. I e-mailed iRiver a week ago.I told Amazon that I wanted to return the replacement MP3 player they quickly sent me because I didn't want anything to do with iRiver. The length of time that passed before iRiver customer service responded to my concern tells me they don't care about the consumer. I won't reward that attitude.Amazon has responded to my concerns within 24 hours of submitting them. I submitted several. iRiver, apparently, couldn't find the time to help me."
1028,"This is a decent filter, it will make your skies bluer and your clouds a bit more contrasty. The effect could be more pronounced though, I can't get the skies quite as deep blue as I would like, even at 90 degrees to the sun. The filter also does a decent job at removing reflections but I feel this could be better also.So in short, this is a decent filter for the money spent but could use some slight improvements."
1029,"I needed this cable for my Mio GPS. I think Mio should have included it as an accessory in the box but I guess they didn't feel it was necessary. So anyway, I ordered two of these cables from the seller ClearAV. Delivery was OK, I received the cables a week after placing my order. But the cable is not 6ft long, despite what it says on the package. The actual length is 40.5 inches. I don't know if you'll get the same cables if you order from a different seller. Nevertheless, I used the cable to hook up my GPS to my computer and it worked fine. My GPS charged up nicely and transferred files with no problems. So I guess I'm OK with them."
1030,"Before installing this product my internet download speeds were always around 5Mbps while my upload speeds were around 2-2.5Mbps. After installing, my speed test results we much more consistent and always got 5.8Mbps and 5.5Mbps on download and upload speeds. Its a cheap way to boost your performance a little so i would recommend it"
1031,"A friend told me to get a circular polarizing filter for my canon lens so the sky here (which is always blue) would pop if there were any clouds.  I needed a protective filter anyway so thought I'd try it.  I really cannot tell the difference when I move the lens as to the difference in polarization.  But, it is a protector for my nice canon lens, even though it is a bit too expensive than just a plain polarizer lens,for just that purpose."
1032,good sturdy cat-5 cable for a connected LAN connection. long enough to fit in those hard to get to spots in your home.
1033,"Won't work in CD recorder as advertised.  These are identified as the type to use for CD recorders (mine is a Philips CDR 870), showing the 'Digital Audio' logo, but the recorder would not read them.  In addition, while they can be used to record from a computer CD burner (as can the cheaper CD-R data discs), at least half of them (so far) are defective.I bought the Sony (purple color packaging) and they work fine.  They have a slight greenish sheen to the recordable side of the disc, and that is what you want.  In the past, I was quite satisfied with Maxell products, but these discs are a waste for those buying to record on a stand-alone component recorder.The question and answer portion of the product page states these do work in a Teac recorder; perhaps so, but not in my Philips (same as Magnavox), so be careful."
1034,"I like the length of this plug but when I move around a little bit I get a lot of static. I keep it plugged in to my work computer and I don't move much, so for the most part it works fine. The cable seems to be of decent quality and it certainly is thick enough. Overall I would recommend this extension for the price if you are not an audiophile and just want to add some length to your headphones."
1035,Since the day one the product it is not working well. I need to keep on adjusting one connector to listen to the sound. I bought this especially to watch movies by me and my wife so that my son wont get disturbed when he is sleeping.My both of the headphones are from Sony & Apple and they work superb when Iuse them independently.Overall i could say i am not much satisfied with this product.
1036,I am working on some close up scientific photography so I use the 100 mm macro lens almost exclusively.  It allows exquisite close up photography that is (finally!) in focus at most points of my three dimensional subjects.  This camera and this lens are a blessing and I couldn't complete my project in a high quality manner without them!
1037,"... and still going strong. I love these headphones. I've traveled with them a lot. I put them on and I'm transferred to a different world, a tranquil world.I'll buy another pair when these expire. :)"
1038,Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  I am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near future.
1039,"If you want better sound get the 50mm versions (MDR6506?).  Anyway, this is what we use in professional studios. Aint nothing expensive to buy.  How do you like that?This is what the record you are listening to was mastered with!"
1040,"I think the Cassiopeia E-125 is the best of the current Pocket PC devices. Unlike the various Jornadas, it is stylish. And unlike the iPAQs, it doesn't have any glaring hardware deficiencies (iPAQ: dust under the screen, occasional reversed screen, nonreplaceable battery). The E-125 display is bright and beautiful, brighter than I thought I'd ever see on a handheld device.Some things I discovered:The technical specs say Windows 95 is supported. What they don't tell you is that you get a USB cradle with the E-125 but only serial (RS-232) syncing is supported under Windows 95. So if you're using Windows 95 you'll have to either buy a serial cable or hope that you can get infrared syncing to work (I couldn't). The same is true for Windows NT 4. Windows 98 + USB works fine.If you're using USB for syncing, you cannot do a full backup of the device without installing a fix onto the E-125 for the USB driver. Without the fix the backup will run for a while and then get stuck.The built-in handwriting recognition works but only if you draw your letters exactly as the recognizer expects. The recognizer cannot be trained to understand your handwriting. This is little better than Palm's Graffiti, but at least you don't have to learn the Graffiti chickenscratch. There is a better handwriting recognition product available called Transcriber. It has much better default recognition and it is trainable for problem characters. Transcriber is free and downloadable from Microsoft's web siteIt is also on the ActiveSync CD that comes with the E-125.Lefties should note that this is a right-handed device. Both the hardware buttons and the scrollbars on the appplications are laid out for righties.Under Windows every application has a little 'X' at the top right of the window frame that you can use to close the app. That 'X' is not present on Pocket PC apps, which makes it somewhat cumbersome to close applications. The fastest way to close an app is by typing ctrl-q at the onscreen keyboard. This works with all the builtin applications.I rate the E-125 four stars for an excellent device with some software issues. If you would buy this unit for some particular application (Pocket Explorer, Pocket Excel, etc.) check Internet resources to verify that the applications have the features you need before laying down your money. All &quot;Pocket&quot; versions of Microsoft applications have missing features that may be critical to you."
1041,I bought this as a back up plug. It works no real issues. Wire is durable and the plug fits snug.
1042,"I so wanted to love this lens. All the reviews I had read about it were positive. Most all agree that if you are going to do any portrait work, you NEED this lens. So I bought it. And like most everything I buy from Amazon it arrived in just a few day's. Soon as I opened it, I could see light damage (ruffled edges) to the Canon lens original box. So yeah... it had been opened before. My first thoughs were uh oh, this probably isn't going to work well. Someone must have returned it, and it got reshipped to me. Hmmmm put it on the camera, and sure enough the pic's were not sharp and clear. No where near as good as the kit lens that came with the Rebel (T2i). So I shipped it back the next day. I have sense bought the 50mm 1.8 (Amazon) and couldn't be more happy with it. It takes awesome pics. I still want the 85mm, just a little fearfull to order another right now."
1043,Belkin has never disappointed me in their quality and function and neither does this cable that I use for my printer.
1044,"So much better than the Rebel X!  It it lightweight, takes fabulous pictures, and looks good to boot!  Having used my mom's Rebel X for years, I finally bought the 2000 in September of 2002.  I love the fact of having it!  In the bag, it doesn't break my shoulders like the X did, and takes beautiful photos.  I am into SLR, however, my first digital will be a Minolta DiMage 7i (non-SLR).  I *will* be keeping this one, though, for the long distance shots with the other lense I have for it and teleconverter.  Worth having for anybody!"
1045,"update:  I ended up tossing mine in the junk drawer.  It was just too difficult for me to use comfortably. |I've been using this mouse for about a week now.  I use a mouse all day long. I've used lots of different kinds of mice to alleviate finger pains.  I didn't buy this one to alleviate any carpal tunnel pains rather I bought it because my index finger was really sore at the last knuckle from left clicking all day long.  Here's what I really like:  the single button at the top of the stick that does both left and right mouse clicks with the thumb is pretty slick (no more sore knuckle).  What else do I like?  Not much, by comparison to a regular mouse.  Not having a roller wheel is practically a deal breaker.  Instead of the wheel, there is a pistol grip style button that is hard to reach and awkward to squeeze.  Reaching for the joystick style pointer takes a little re-training, too, because it's taller.  Finally, using this as a pointer takes a lot more movement.  I wouldn't be able to use this with a mouse pad because it takes a lot of space to maneuver the pointer.  Occasionally this sticks to the desktop.  If you don't do a LOT of computer usage and are experiencing a lot of pain because of a mouse, this is probably a tool worth trying.  It is definitely a pain relieving tool for me. There is a lot of downside to making this a workable replacement over a standard mouse.  I am trying still to decide if I can live with what I don't like."
1046,This didn't work. The program I am using it for crashes when I select the COM port that this thing is emulating. It's better just to buy the PCI card with serial ports on it.
1047,I bought this for use with my car and motorcycle so needed a battery version. In the motorcycle it fits in a pocket and uses an earphone and can't get laser but all cruisers use radar here (Ontario) and stationary laser has no real defense.I find that even on the highway I am seeing the cruiser often well  before I get a signal - car or bike. I think they are using a very weak RF signal but even if they do the product should adjust or stop making claims.
1048,"I'm pretty sure that I've had these headphones since 1992. I can't believe they still make the same model (mine look exactly like the model pictured).After fourteen years, the material covering the foam padding is starting to crack, but they still sound great."
1049,"not a constant picture -- looks like a breeze is running through my display, depending on the hour. but the resolution is otherwise good. will be buying a shielded HD VGA cable next..."
1050,"I got a pair of portapros, KSC75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver. And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of ""closing"" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4"" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on."
1051,"it does the job.  It is 10 feet of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable, lol, what more can I say!  it worked!  Didn't need to send it back!"
1052,"(...).  The first Z-680 I received was DOA--the right-front channel was dead right out of the box.  I didn't know this until I had drilled holes in my walls, ran the wire and set up the whole system.  But, Amazon.com, true to its excellent ways with customers, had a second Z-680 on my doorstep in about 4 days.  I was thrilled!  So I set up this second system, turned it on and was so happy to hear the wonderful sound out of all the speakers.  This happiness turned to rage about 20 minutes later when a buzzing sound started up, getting louder as the system heated up.  The next day I tried again and after a few minutes I heard a pop and several of the channels went dead.  So this system went back too.(...).  Being an electrical engineer and having worked with PCs since the early 80's, I pretty well know what I'm doing when it comes to connecting components to PCs.  I know my sound card, a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2, is functioning properly.  I have excellent surge supprssion in my power supply.  This leaves only the Z-680 to blame.  I can only suspect that what Logitech is sending to Amazon to offload on its customers is not the same quality or tested units that have won Logitech such positive reviews.  Not willing to go through the hours of hard work involved in the unpacking, installation, uninstalling, repacking and reshipping again, I decided to go with my second choice the Creative MegaWorks 5.1 550 system.  This system worked right out of the box and has continued to give me much that I expected to get from the Z-680.I'm not happy not to have gotten the Z-680 system.  It has features that I would prefer over the Creative system.  Having worked so closely to both, the Z-680 is much more robust and has the digital output and a true remote control.  The 15-20 minutes of sound that I had from the second Z-680 system was superb.  I truly wish I was now listening to the Z-680 system, not because I have any complaints about the Creative MegaWorks THX 5.1 550, but because of what the Z-680 has that the MegaWorks does not.  (...)"
1053,"I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them."
1054,"OK so I was tired of having to sign off PS2 Online in order to chat with friends so I made what I perceived to be an investment in order to get the best of both worlds. I went along with advice from others and abstained from the wireless routers and I noticed that a particular router, the D-LINK DI-604 was on sale. I went ahead and bought it and tried installing it on my computer. Now the hassle that I needed software installed and everything. I assumed that I just needed to plug in the Cat5 cables into the router, connect a few other cables and BAM, i'm done. But no, in addition to that, I must install software onto my computer which turned out to be a nightmare. I needed to figure out the IP address of my PS2 which took hours and I had to search through at least 10 website forums in order to get advice because D-LINK's advice proved useless. Alhough I must say that the D-LINK customer service is very fast and attentive, they simply couldn't solve my problems. So I FINALLY managed to install it and worked correctly after about 5-6 hours of constant work. But I must say it works like a charm now and I'd hate to see what hassles a wireless router bring. Please follow my advice and have a computer expert install this for you. If you're simply using it for multiple computers, it shouldn't be too hard though. Just be careful.Thank You"
1055,Works like a battery.  This is a replacement for the original battery of the same type that lasted 3 years.  Three years was the expected lifetime for the battery.  Would be nice if the battery lasted longer.  The free return shipping for recycling the old battery is good.
1056,"I bought two of these cards for my Windows XP boxes when I upgraded my home network to gigabit ethernet.  Both cards have begun to experience problems.  Basically they drop the network connection periodically. When the cards are disabled and re-enabled, they work fine.  I thought I might have a router or DNS problem (usually the issue manifests itself by a failed website call) but I am running with fixed IP addresses and have other computers, both Macs and PCs, running on the same network with no problems. I plan to experiment with drivers but this is a nuisance and I would not buy a Hawking card again."
1057,"This coax cable seems to be well made, it's very flexible and was easy to install. I used this cable to replace an old cable that had to be spliced to make it long enough. Much to my surprise the cable exhibited terrible signal loss (it decreased from -6dbi to -13dbi). I wound up having the cable company come out to install their shielded RG6 cable and there wasn't any signal loss at all. Buyer beware..."
1058,Awesome low freq definition. Highs are equally good. For the price ..its absolutely unbeatable. Haven't yet found anyone beat these old babies. I had already tried some good stuff like the Klipsch custom 3. Porta Pro rules
1059,"I have had dozens of headphones, these work well with my ipod.  I will leave sonic reviews to others, but I do not like booming and distorted bass, such as with the extremely overpriced (IMO) Beats headphones.  The V6 seems to be a good value with fairly flat response and reasonable sensitivity.I have a large head and these are comfortable to me. Sound isolation is good, much better than I thought it would be given the comfort and size.After reading about the pad wear, I will try periodic cleaning with a vinyl conditioner.  I ordered these with a coiled cord which is a heavier than a straight cord, so pay attention when ordering if cord type is important to you."
1060,"The venerable V6 is a steal at $70.  I also own a pair of  MDR7506's and the sound is indistinguishable between them.  Hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great.  And it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from Sony's parts division.The Sennheiser HD280 is the main competitor to the V6/MDR7506.  Connected to studio/home equipment, the HD280 may be a better choice for classical, jazz and acoustic music.  The mids sound a little cleaner than the V6.  Having said that the HD280 is larger than the V6 and requires more power for equal loudness and bass.  iPods and MP3 players just don't have enough juice to power the Sennheiser; the V6 is more efficient."
1061,"I had cdp-cx 220 since 4 years.No problem at all.But this one can not read the CD's and making best afford to break my CD's.Worst this is not happened all the time and impossible to repair.I don't trust Sony anymore.But finally I remove the cove and remove all related loading mechanism,I found a problem.It was a switch which is not working.After I replace the switch no problem at all.But I believe that This product never been in quality control."
1062,"These are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned.  Sony got it right when they invented the MDR-V6's, and that's why they've stayed pretty much the same (even the packaging) for about 30 years.  I'd recommend them to anyone."
1063,"A word of warning: This may work well with PCs but perhaps not with Macs running the latest version of Lion. It was OK with OS X 10.4 but it caused kernel panics in Lion (10.7). I had to buy a new hub that was compatible, a Tripp Lite U222-010-R USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Hub from Amazon. There is some blame attributable to the Apple software upgrade."
1064,"The build quality is super cheap but so was the price, so it's worth it right?  Only if you are VERY careful pulling the legs out...  This is a very delicate tripod and one that breaks very easily.  Also the panning is not very fluid, but rather jerky.  Yes I know this is a $10 tripod, what do you expect?  I didn't expect the leg to come off, and then the buckle, and then another leg!  So ask yourself, do you really want to trust the safety of your $1000 DSLR to a flimsy tripod?"
1065,"If you wave it around or place it outside your window, the reception of local stations that are available in the car crystal clear - improves to respectable. Sitting 4 feet from the stereo - the performance is pretty limp. Slightly better than nothing at all, but just slightly. It is cheap, which is good, but I don't think I'd buy this again knowing how little it would improve things. If you have a great location (say - the window facing the direction the transmitter is), then maybe it's worthwhile, otherwise I'd say not."
1066,"This keyboard works ok but as some other reviewers have noted the touch pad is poor.  We can move the mouse cursor to the right but when trying to move to the left it jumps around.  We have to swipe repeatedly to get it to the left side of the screen.  I tried adjusting the preferences in windows for scrolling speed, etc but it hasn't helped.  I also couldn't find a driver from the manufacturer to update that might fix it.  We now use this keyboard with a regular mouse in a confined space.  Not what we wanted."
1067,"These are OK but very poorly made. The break just opening them. Heaven help you if actually drop one, then it's toast. Pay a little more and get some that are more durable."
1068,I would have given it a 5 star if the keyboard can lay downflat as mentioned by another reviewer here before.
1069,"I bought this cord for my HP all in one printer, and my roommate bought one for his Epson printer. Both our cords work perfectly with our printers BUT... They are white in color, where I expected them to be black, and they are not Belkin possibly. They do not come in a Belkin cover, and they do not say  Belkin anywhere on the cord or the plastic cover it came in. Apart from this, you will be lucky to find such a long USB cord for so cheap. It's definitely worth it."
1070,"Just like most of the other reviewers stated that you can't go wrong getting this lens. The 1.8 gives a depth of field that is beautiful for portraits, pets, flowers and objects. But remember, this is not a macro lens. I was also surprised by the sharpness. Although I am spoiled by the 18-55 wide angle versatility of the lens that came with my camera this lens takes better photos in sharpness and beauty. You have to step-back more often to get the shot. I think of it as an old school lens like when I had my first film SLR. I also got the recommended lens shade which also makes the lens look a little ""cooler"" and adds protection. Of course, if you have a $1000 to burn then look for another lens but for this price, you get a lens that will give you professional looking results at a fraction of the cost of professional lenses!- UPDATED -gave it 5 stars initially but after 1.5 years it just came apart for no reason. does not work any more. saving up to get a better sigma 1.4 ($450) as other reviewers stated about this poor build quality."
1071,I've had this radio for about a week now and other than the cheesy plastic knobs it looks great and until today worked great.  It just started to drift as others have observed.  Sure glad I bought it from Amazon as it's going to have to go back as defective.  I chose this one over the Sangean for looks and (perceived) quality.  I made the wrong choice.
1072,"My first vcr worked great, and when I needed to replace my second vcr, I assumed I was doing a good thing by buying an identical RCA.  Boy was I wrong.  The second vcr refused to play any tapes recorded on other vcrs.  Other vcrs can't play anything recorded on it.  Incredibly irritating because the whole point of two vcrs was so that my daughter could watch recorded shows in the other room!Footnote:  The one that I thought was good just ate a brand new tape and refuses to turn on.  It's going into the garbage with the other one!"
1073,"Great bass... very comfortable even after hours and hours of listening. I use them for my studio work. Sound is completely isolated when they're on your head or cupped together, so there's very little bleed. They are a little tight, so if you have a fat head, these might not be for you. They look great, but handle them with a bit of care, since they are plastic and seem a little prone to breaking due to the many moving parts."
1074,The desktop is new to my other desktop but the second monitor is nearly on the other side of the room.  This worked just fine.
1075,"These things are completely terrible for me.  They don't stay in the ear,and actualy fall off when I'm lying on the bench,  and the sounds is bad.  Stay away"
1076,"Got these for my wife. I have listend to them too. Great sound. Full range and bass. A lot better than the ear plugs. Also, cancels out a good bit of noise."
1077,"I was curious how this headphones did in comparison with 7506 and they sound exactly identical, i did plug both on a 3.5 splitter adapter so i can hear both with same song and same equalization, they do sound exactly the same, so now i dont thing the burning in process really exist, my 7506 have easy 400  hrs of use and and i cant hear any difference, so, if you cant decide which ones to by between these 2 just go for the cheaper ones, they also look the same but for some reason they feel cheaper  than 7506, thanks"
1078,"I always wanted to like these headphones, but they just hurt my head and ears too much. I have a pair of Koss Porta Pros that I love, but they don't seal out any outside noise. I am still searching for a pair of over-the-ear phones that are comfortable and don't cost and arm and a leg (like the Bose TriPort, the most comfortable headphone I have ever seen)."
1079,"This switch worked fine for me using an ancient no-name LCD monitor at 1024x768.  However, when I switched to an NEC 17"" 1280x1024 screen one display kept ""twitching"".  Experimenting, it seems that the signal from one computer is leaking through into the other - the problem is only present when the ""not displayed"" computer is connected.  This is only a problem with one of the two computers, suggesting that it depends on the video card (one card is an old, but fairly high-end nVidia, the other ""built in"" to the mobo).Anyway, in my case, it's unusable at the higher resolution.  Unfortunately Belkin seem to be the main competitor, and my experience with them (an old 4 port switch) has been poor too.[added later - the nVidia card later failed, so it's possible that there was a problem with the card]"
1080,"I had a package of these come with a camera almost 10 years ago ,and they worked better on my cell phones than the fancy schmancy phone protector films that cost more than 10 times as much and come off in a couple days. Alas, the ones in this package have been ""improved"" and come precut in sizes smaller than any device screen I still own. If they were really the old style, which you had to cut yourself, I would give them 5 stars."
1081,"These seem to overheat and die after about a year.  I took mine apart after it stopped working and there was noticable heat damage to the plastic on the inside.  Also, if you move a LOT of data it will become confused after about a day and need to be reset."
1082,"I know this camera is old. However, it is similar to the newer models. Don't buy this camera. I bought it quit after 5 years of use with great care in handling it. The reason I bought it was because it took 4, AA batteries. This seemed like a good feature at first with not having to recharge the battery all the time, but it also made the camera have a delay while taking pictures. The delay was long enough for me to miss many great shots. The batteries just aren't strong enough for a fast flash.My next camera will probably be a Pentax Optio M50. It is great for casual shots like when the family gets together. It is also only around $200 at the time of this review. Canon has good cameras, but this series is not one of them, and I give the A70, 2 stars for working 5 years. And all things considered 2 stars is generous."
1083,"After several tries, we haven't figured out how to use this adapter with our computer. The CD that comes with it isn't loading on our computer and so the purchase hasn't been used."
1084,"Dish Network uses a proprietary receiver and this remote has no code for that unit.  The remote's 'code search' capability cannot find a code for it. Calls to Sony support were worthless; hard to believe Sony isn't familiar with Dish Network, one of the major satelite TV providers.Connects well to the TV, VCR and DVD player, but that does little good when it won't control the reception and channels.Be nice if they'd tell you it doesn't work with Dish Network BEFORE you order it."
1085,I got a real cables to go product from amazon but the ends on this cable are loose so you may need to crimp it down the road.
1086,These work OK but gave it only 2 stars because I bought these and the 540 at the same time.  The 540 have more features and are worth the additional money.
1087,"I tried it on a new Unicomp keyboard and an older IBM Model M.  It wouldn't work on either.  My unit could be DOA, but not worth sending back."
1088,"I used this for a couple of years, and it worked flawlessly.  Initially, I did not use WEP.  I caught someone on my network, so I enabled WEP security.  Now the bridge no longer connected.  So, I tried to run the setup again and reconfigure.  I was never able to connect, ever  again.  Not sure what the reset button does, but did not seem to make a difference.I've owned a lot of Linksys products.  The main thing I've noticed since they were bought by Cisco - most of the products do not last more that 18 to 24 months before they start failing.  I've been through 3 routers and 2 modems in less than 4 years ( all on an APC UPS' )."
1089,"This kit includes all of the basics for PC repair, and even has a container for spare parts (and has space available for you to add your own things in there). It's large enough such that I could add a few of my own tools (precision screwdriver, pen light, pencil), and secures things pretty nicely.After many months of owning this, the screwdriver pits have begun to poke holes in/tear the elastic that secures them in place, and the elastic holding in the case for parts has stretched out a bit, and doesn't hold them in place very well anymore.The kit is otherwise very good, and the tools are of fair quality. I would certainly buy this kit again, even if just for the tools."
1090,"Sony DJ version of the headset MDR-V500 and up has been great quality in terms of strong cabling material and durable ear piece. My first headset last me more than 10 years. That is with normal wear and tear. Its worth it. The price is not expensive and generally can't be compared with expensive Bose headphones or the higher headset from Sony.  It perfectly price for it purpose, not expensive and works better than the ear bugs piece."
1091,"At the price and promotion of these phones, much is left to be desired.  Output is weak and limited.  Modrate range only can be achieved via and EQ or Amplifier.  Best suited for home audio, not for portables.Construction is light, weak and flimsy.  Actually, the poorest build I've seen at this price.The dynamic range of this unit is easily matched by most Koss units.  A watch-sign is how Bose doesn't disclose this unit's Ohmage, range or diaphragm set-up, in package or at the official site.Will use them while they hold together, not much choice.Not at all recommended.  The noise cancelling model is great for flights but, still the same problems.A real disappointment, especially from Bose."
1092,"I am on my third one of these access points now. Both boxes simply stopped responding and wouldn't reset. Netgear technical support was no help either. My advice, try the Linksys box first."
1093,"The center knob broke off in my hand in the middle of a shoot within the first 10 times I used it. As time passed one of the plastic supports between the center and the legs snapped. I wish I would have spent a few more dollars and gotten something that was going to last.If you care about the gear you're putting on top of this at all, don't trust it to this tripod."
1094,"I've used cheaper pens that didn't lose as many bristles as this thing does.  For now, I'm using my Giottos Air Blower.EDIT: 12/14/2013Do your self a favor and try these;B00ELB91V8They work, the bristles stay put and they were delivered so quickly."
1095,"I've purchased about 20 of these, simply because they fail all of the time and I've been (to date) unwilling to mix switch vendors on our LAN.  Some last forever, but most die within a year or so.  Ports lock up, or the unit will fail entirely.The bigger issue is that the ""Lifetime Warranty"" is rendered useless by their company policies and practices.  First of all, they force you to register your item online (though I thought ""warranty blackmail"" by forced registration wasn't allowed these days) so you can join their marketing database, I suppose.Once you register, you go through the whole ""chat"" process.  Enter your serial number again, all of your info, and then be told that since it's more than a certain number of days old, you're not allowed to chat.  You need to do a ticket.So, re-enter all of your information again.  Your 20-digit serial number, etc. Wait a couple of days to be told I need to submit proof of purchase.  Copy and pasting your Amazon order confirmation?  You could have forged that, so that won't do.In short, a nice switch while it works.  If you earn more than $8 per hour, however, your time will be better spent tossing it than trying to get a replacement.Other:  Nice metal case.  Runs fairly hot.  Unreliable and tiny power bricks that run hot.  If and when power brick gets flaky, switch gets flaky too rather than shutting down on undervoltage.  Has 100mb/1Gbit lights as is pretty much standard."
1096,"I've used more than a few headphones over the years, including some Sennheiser pro studio models. The Sennheiser' are typically uncomfortable after an hour or two, so if you plan to spend time at a board they can be painful, and depending on how long you where them the pain can last a day or two. The Sony V6 headset is very comfortable enough so that I've used them all night well actually all day and night without experiencing much discomfort, and the sound in my opinion is superior to anything I've tried recently. In the last few years I've switched to using earbuds for most of my casual listening and simply had forgotten how great a decent full size headset sounds.Over all, I've found this set to be very true reproducing recorded music, and are better than anything I've used in the sub $150.00 price range. One test I've used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments, especially the sound of a piano. If a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano they're usually a good bet. Being a acoustic string guy I also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar, mandolin and violin. If they are accurate on those simple tests then I would grab them. This set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything I listen for with exceptional precision. I paid a lot more than a $100.00 for my Sennheiser' but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of time.I would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound. The range from 5 HZ-30 KHZ should be ample for anyone though the Bass is not exaggerated it is clean tight and powerful enough for myself anyway. Honestly these would be a very good choice for home studio or for casual listening, and if you've been spending hundreds on earbuds you have to give these a try."
1097,good sound quality for such a low price. I like that the cable comes out of only the left side.
1098,I know these headphones are not as cool as Dr. Dre's but they have excellent sound and bass. They are comfortable to wear and store easily. Highly recommended.
1099,"I like linksys products typically. In fact I was really upset when Verizon FIOS switched me to their proprietary router. But this wireless bridge was ALWAYS acting up. I could never get it to stay connected to the network for more than 24 hours. It's like everytime it tried to renew it's IP, it died. And the weird thing was, I couldn't cycle the power on the surge protector; I HAD to pull the pluc out of the WET and then plug it back in. When it DID work, it worked as advertised. But it was always killing the connection."
1100,"The jack is not a 3.5mm plug. It's similar but has 4 contact points instead of 3( right, left, and common). I tired jamming it into a 3.5mm female, but only getsound from 1 channel. So useless."
1101,"Used them while working out.  Spent more time pushing them back in my ears.  Base response good, OK product, but not for me.  I bought Koss ""Sparkplug"" ear headphones, they are outstanding."
1102,I bought this product to use with a USB based KVM switch I use to hook up computers I am working on. As such I am constantly connecting/disconnecting one end from various machines and so far it is hold up well. But I would expect nothing less from Belkin.
1103,"This is a good general lens. I bought a Canon 40D body only. The kit lens was out of stock and I wasn't getting good enough reviews to wait around until it was available. I purchased this lens as my primary lens. I had read good reviews and it was well within the price range. The autofocus is quick and smooth and picture quality is very good-excellent. I think this is a great choice to replace a ""kit"" lens and not break the bank."
1104,"I agree with those who say the look is retro, but I have to say the sound is fantastic, especially for $30.! I compared it to my full size Sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great. When playing various styles of music you'll find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music, but it was no slouch on the classical side. It really brought my laptop to life, whether it was music or a movie. I would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair, but that wasn't too diffucult. My son tried it and he wanted to trade the Sony's I gave him, I told him he was out of luck!"
1105,"These are very flimsy and the volume control doesn't work well. I wanted to use this to listen to television, but the volume is far too low."
1106,"I purchased this hoping it would be an improvement over my existing rabbit ears for a new ATSC TV I have in a guest bedroom.  It was no better, in fact they were worse than the GE Model TV24734 that I purchased at a big box department store.  Some stations that I could coax a picture out of with the GE's I cannot with the TERK TV-1's.  So either the TV-1 is just not that good or the GE is better than I thought.  My next try might be one of the Philips Silver Sensor's."
1107,"I bought this lens specifically because I had an opportunity to attend my first boxing event and needed a fast, low-light lens. This lens was highly recommended.  When I received lens I took a few test shots and discovered the lens not as sharp as I had expected based on the comments in the evaluations.  The kit lens on my Canon T2i was much sharper.Several days after lens arrived I attended the event.  Still in the first round of the first match, camera in the continuous shooting mode, I got a notice saying communication problem between lens and camera, clean the lens contacts. I removed the lens, wiped off the contacts, assembled camera and lens and resumed shooting.  Almost immediately another notice and another cleaning.  One more notice and cleaning and the camera stopped working.  My only solution was to use the kit lens and the result, as I feared, is no useful shots.  Everything is pitch black as though the event was taking place at midnight on a very dark night.The photos that I managed to take with the 50mm before it stopped working aren't bad.  Because I was trying to shoot at 400 or 500 to stop the action in limited light, they are somewhat dark but this can be corrected in Photoshop Elements.  There is also some blurriness of the sort I experienced with the first test shots, but I attribute this to a defect in this lens. What I am saying is that this lens seems to have been a good choice for my purpose, but because it was defective I am giving this lens only 1 star.Lens is being returned to Amazon.I have ordered a lot from Amazon over the years and always read the evaluations first.  Invariably, no matter how many 4 and 5 star ratings are given a product, there are at least a couple from people disappointed because product was defective.  This seems to have been my turn to be one of those people."
1108,"These headphones are great at this price! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!"
1109,"I am most certainly not an audiophile but these headphones came highly recommended not only from other sites but from other people I know. They are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again.I am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and I demand a lot from them.With that said these are my new favorite headphones (the one's that travel with me everywhere).I was skeptical even after reading all the reviews, thinking ""How could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest."" Well they can be and are, consider my doubts banished as I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are correct, this is Koss' masterpiece, homerun, the epitome of what Koss represents.I have a pair of Bose Triport Headphones and Senneheiser PX200's both of which are excellent headphones....and these Porta Pros are commandingly better (the Triports are ""warmer"" and the Senneheisers crisper, but I like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness).They are light weight, foldable, exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent.Actually, I cannot say enough about the sound quality, it is well balanced, full, hits the highs, lows and everything in between accurately. They produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to. I find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears.Essentially they are awesome. (period) They sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price, look cool if you're into retro and they are dirt cheap.CONCERNS:The only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn't seem very robust and may break eventually(though I haven't had any issues). Some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair (something else I haven't had an issue with, though I have short hair) and finally, the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream I'm cheap and I will wear out on you. In defense of them, it does keep with the whole retro thing, it's really comfortable, it's easily replaceable, and they are in fact inexpensive, essentially who cares. Many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the Anniversary Edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones (but for twice the price I wouldn't bother). Oh and Koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product, ridiculous!(amazing) For me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the window.Conclusion:-Beautiful design and function (form and function married beautifully, just one of those products that is right on, balanced, perfect in most ways) Clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made these.-Koss' famous lifetime warranty.-Worth every penny, I would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldn't bat an eye. Awesome part is you don't have to. I would buy them again, for myself or others."
1110,"Seems well-built to do the job.  A little hard to get on and off, but not a real nuisance, holds to your wrist securely.  The main thing besides drawing off static.  Which I don't have the electrical equipment to see if it really is doing that.  Got to trust the manufacturer here."
1111,"This would be a great product, especially for the price, but it does not offer keyboard based switching. Most of these port switchers allow you to press some key combination (like ScrollLock twice) to switch. But, this one only works with the front-panel buttons. This is very inconvienent and a deal killer for me. Be forewarned. If you do not mind having to push a button on a box, it is fine."
1112,"PlanetReplay, the site that facilitates the sharing of shows over the internet stopped that function on 1/16/03. The ethernet port still gets the program guide only. This is a BIG loss"
1113,"Pros:* Reasonably comfortable.  Not nearly as comfortable as my old AKGs, but there are much less comfortable head phones out there.* Looks okay.  I mean, not great, but they look like an okay pair of headphones in a chunky plasticky way.* Reasonably tough.  Just yesterday my foot was on the wire and I stood up.  The left headphone popped off and a little piece of plastic went flying across the room.  Gathering up the parts, I was able to piece it back together and it's as mediocre as new!Cons:* Sound quality.  Wow.  These are probably the worst sounding pair of headphones I've ever used.  The previous reviewer that mentions the cheapo earbuds that came with your MP3 player will sound better is spot on.  These will make you think there is something wrong with your equipment.  Some people may be more used to muddy low end and terrible scratchy treble.  If you aren't using them for music, they may suit you, for me these fail the most basic of requirements.* Wire.  My AKG head phones had the wire come out just one side of the headphones.  I miss that.  These have a wire on each side.  I find this design makes the headphones much more cumbersome to wear and take on and off."
1114,Try the Jbuds version of this.The retractable gimmick is better on paper than in use.
1115,"I am really surprised and upset. I used to think that the name Sony was synonymous with well made product. These head phones and uncomfortable and keep falling off every time I move. Additionally, the inferred, used to emulate wireless, is problematic at best. If I put my feet up or scratch my nose the wrong way, the signal is blocked. In the future I will think twice about buying Sony and will definitely never again buy a wireless device which uses inferred."
1116,"The following reasons together make these earphones unusable for me. If you have similar preferences,1) The cord is too short. There isn't enough length or slack for me to have my device below the belt while being able to move my head around. There are plenty of alternatives that either have a longer cord, or have a short cord (for when your device is on your arm) with an included extension cable.2) The earbuds are too big. I may not have big ears, but they're not small either. I've been through several earphones, and none have been as uncomfortable as these.3) The cord going to each ear is the same length. I like having the main cord on one side, and then a split at about neck-level to the other ear."
1117,"We bought two packs of these for our wedding. Our favor was a mixed CD chosen by the wedding party. The price was good.The packs arrived fine, and there wasn't any damage per se that Amazon would have been responsible for. It was just upon opening, and using, them, that we found maybe 5, total, over both packs, that had cracks and breaks in the spin and cover hinge, clearly from their initial packaging. That was okay, but the bigger problem, for me, was that a lot of them had imperfections -- streaks, dots, something or other *in* the plastic. Nothing huge, and nothing you would care about for your own use, so if you're buying these for your own CDs, really, they'll be fine. But for wedding favors, they looked bad. Another 10 or so (over both packs) were unusable in that regard.You get what you pay for and these were cheap, usable and fine. Just not your best option for presentation."
1118,"Bought these to replace a pair of Bose headphones that broke apart after 4 years.  I didn't want to spend a ton of cash on a higher end so after reading reviews; I settled on these.  I have to say, these are better than the $179 bose headphones I bought.  Everything is clear and crisp.  Bass isn't too overwhelming.  I mostly use these to listen to my iPod, but it's almost got me wanting to set up a home studio and get started on some recording to really test them out.  Only drawback is the exposed wires.  I'm afraid that if I adjust these it might pinch.  I will just have to be careful."
1119,"I was able to burn an audio cd in 6 minutes at 12x using a Celeron 366!! 8 minutes for an audio cd on a CDRW at 10x. The burner is quiet too, unlike my sisters Yamaha CDRW. As for being burn-proof... while using the burn-proof technology, I thought I would be able to surf the net. I was wrong. My PC froze and therefore created an incomplete CD.  This is the only reason why it did not get a 5 star rating. Also, I use Nero 5, not EZ CD Creator. I like it a lot better."
1120,Mine stopped working about 2 months after the warranty ran out. A waste of my hard earned cash. Replaced it with a Samsung V3650. Works flawlessly.Did i mention the toshiba was junk?
1121,"I have had these for about six months now and gotta say that they're great value for money. I listen to death metal, classical, jazz, classic rock, trance, ... and these do all of them justice. Mid-range guitars don't sound muddy, bass is punchy (could be a bit bass heavy for some) and highs are not screechy at all.The thing is, the design hasn't changed a whole lot since the 80s when they were first introduced. They are open-air headphones, meaning that they leak sound...both ways. So don't wear these on a subway or in a loud area, as they do not block out sound at all.The adjusting mechanism hasn't affected my hair as much as others here, but it is still an issue. Extend the phones beyond your head size, then adjust down. This way your hair won't get pulled out as often.The cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them; I've knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and haven't had any problems.With regards to comfort, I wear glasses, and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face. Not comfortable at all. These, thanks to those weird-looking comfort pads above the &#34;ear&#34; pads, don't.Other headphones tend to make my ears heat up. Not these.Overall, a great pair for the price, and the portability just makes them that much better. 5/5."
1122,"I'm going to admit up front that I probably abused this cable.  I wrapped the female end around a bar on the treadmill to keep it in place.  Now I've got sketchy performance when listening through headphones -- the left and right alternately cut out depending on how I bend the cable end.  I now HAVE to bend the cable end and I have to do it in just the right way or else I get just right, left, or nothing.So, be careful how you handle this cable.  I've certainly learned my lesson for the next cable."
1123,"As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.After retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it."
1124,The idea was great but the workmanship and parts can make any great idea a flop. After a week the battery charger stopped working in the headphone cradle. I expected better from Sony. Very disapointed.
1125,"Have to give it three stars because I honestly can't say how it is. I purchased a Nikon S3500 camera and below the item, the battery was included in the &#34;Customers who bought this item also bought...&#34; Since my camera was the S3500, I assumed it was the right battery because it said it worked in a Nikon 3500. Nope. Too big and the contacts are wrong. I gave three stars only because I've had Nikon products before and they were always good."
1126,"I was disappointed in this pack of blank CD's. I have been buying this brand for years and always happy to use them, but this time they kept saying put another disc in when I tried to record. I thought maybe they were DVD's so I tried one in a friend's  DVD recorder and the disc just didn't work.Maybe they were a defect. Sorry I tried at least 8 and each I threw away.I hope the next ones they may have will be as great as they always have been before this pack.Most of my reordings of music and pictures are on Memorex CD's. I don't hold a grudge towards this seller.I'll try them again. Maybe they have new ones this time."
1127,"This is WGR614 v6. I can't comment on reliability under load and long term - I only used it for a day, but it gets ridiculously hot even without any traffic traveling through it."
1128,"I had purchased another brand of wireless remote control for my two Nikon DSLR's but I returned it and bought this Nikon version because I prefer to have Nikon accessories.What I got was a lemon. No packaging - it came in a thin plastic wrapping, with a nice little pouch for the gadget,  no instructions, which I didn't need anyway as I have used a similar one before.  the Nikon remote  worked a couple of times then it went dead. I changed the battery three times, thinking that was the problem. Still dead.Unfortunately, I didn't get to try this unit until two months after I received it - that's how trusting I am when it comes to Nikon;  the return date had expired when it conked out.  Amazon says I can still return it with 'partial refund,' (didn't say how much) and I have to pay for shipping again.This is an overpriced and cheaply made product, a disservice to the Nikon brand; it's good if it works, but don't count on it to work for any length of time. It's a piece of crap, like so many other electronic products these days."
1129,"I watched the video, read the instructions, and this seems like it should be awesome, but unfortunately results varies drastically. The felt tip came off after 3 Lenses cleaning. The cranking cap that recharges the carbon seems like it contains nothing on the other end, touched it with my finger, there is no carbon on the felt. If there were, my finger should have black smudges, but it didn't. So with all that said, all three Lenses I cleaned with, didn't get cleaned at all. I had to go back with a Tec pad and clean it the old fashion way."
1130,"Didn't work. I've tried a couple of these units over the past couple of years, hoping that the company would make whatever changes they needed to make to get these units to work as they should. Nothing yet."
1131,"I got the D-Link DP-301U Ethernet Print Server from Fry's about a month ago and was not able to get the supplied CD software to install. I was trying to use the software on a Lenovo X301 Laptop with Windows Vista Business 64 bit. As a result, I returned the item.The product packaging has written on the outside of the box ""compatible with Vista"", but does not specify which version of Vista. Using such imprecise verbiage, in the broader sense, suggest compatibility with the both the 32 and 64 bit versions of Vista as appose to one or the other. At the very least, it leaves open ambiguities.This sort of loosely worded product claim and packaging is either sloppy and or unscrupulous marketing.Minus 1.5 for Ambiguous Product Claim and MarketingMinus 1.5 for Not Compatible with Vista 64"
1132,"I always use ear-bud headphones when walking, for some reason the over-the-ear headphones give me headaches. So I've always also just assumed that I'd never have clear sound. No more! These headphones are wonderful.The range of music I like is very much varied. These sound great for all types, and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs. I'm really amazed, actually. It's weird having sound that's as good as a nice stereo when you're walking the dog.One setback is that I need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable. It's a setback for me. Maybe my ears are getting bigger as I get older? This has never been an issue. Regardless, it's a tiny fault for the best, cheapest headphones I've ever bought."
1133,"I bought this hoping it would be better than the TECSUN PL660 that I own. Boy was I wrong! To be honest it picks up the FM and commercial AM stations better than the TECSUN PL660 but that's it.My biggest annoyance with this Sony is the scan feature. I am talking about scanning the short wave signals. (Not your preset channels.) First off it really doesn't scan, it just goes up five and repeats. In other words, you are on signal 5MHz. When you select scan instead of scanning through 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, etc it just jumps to 5.5, then 5.10, then 5.15 and looks for a signal on those channels instead of scanning all the ones in between.  Also, if you choose auto scan it leaves out huge portions of the band and in stead just looks at the more popular section of the frequency. So instead you have to manually scan it yourself with a very cumbersome control.I ran several tests. I choose ten signals that my TECSUN PL660 received, including the time beacons. The ONLY channel the Sony picked up was the 5 MHz. (For this test I was in California). On one other signal it faintly picked up a wee bit. And before you ask I used the same settings and the same external antenna on both sets.Also the Sony just does not have the same whistle and bells and the ones it does have its difficult to use. For the money the TECSUN PL660 is MUCH better. PLUS on the Tecsun you get the airline bands!If you want a very expensive radio receiver with horrible sound to pick up your local FM/AM stations then sure buy this, otherwise keep shopping."
1134,I use this with my Pyle Pro Drum kit.Its very long so will work in most rooms. Unless you live in a church.I experience midi signal loss occasionally but this may be due to the MIDI drivers and not the cable.This USB cable cannot be LONGER than this as there's a physical limit to USB cables and its 16ft. Check.
1135,"When I bought the headphone, it seemed the best option: light, cheap, good brand.But using it was kind of disapointing. Even at 3,4 feet away you hear a background squeaking.When I had to get new batteries (after 2 months of far-less-than-intense use) I broke the little piece of plastic that holds the battery cover.I am still using (I got used to the squeaking), but as soon as I have a chance I will look for something better.UPDATE (02/01/06): I've lost my patience. It went to garbage. Spend more money and buy something better."
1136,Purchased for a new D5300 with 67mm lenses.  Works well and does what it is supposed to do. Screws on easily and removes easily. Produced  nice results.  Would recommend and purchase again.
1137,"I had a pair of Sennheiser HD 208's i believe, man these things DESTROY them. First of all they aren't tight, at least on my head, so they rest comfortably. Second the sound quality is AMAZING! no wonder they've had these cans selling for decades! if you have an eq on your pc, then you can raise the bass a little if you're feeling frisky (lol). I use them for some mxing and casual listening and they're great so far! Anyway with that said these headphones are great and at $50 (when i bought it) they rival a lot foof the higher end headphone! Definitely in my recommendation for a good set of headphones!!"
1138,"these types of caps don't stay on well, and I'm constantly retrieving or chasing after it as it rolls into puddles, mountainsides, and other equally convenient to retrieve places. I'm just going to fork out the extra six or eight bucks to get something better the next time I lose this one."
1139,"This is what I get for trying to economize.  This speaker sounded harsh and nasal, like someone talking through a box.  I returned it and got screwed on the return shipping.  Definitely not recommended."
1140,"Wired my blue ray player to allow streaming movies over a reliable network - Done !!  Having part of my network wired allowed the two wireless laptops to be more reliable(phone calls don't interfere anymore) and function at a ""n"" faster network speed.  The movies are fine (some in HD) and rarely fail do to network issues.  Just treat the cable with respect - do not sharply bend or pull hard.  The white color goes with my walls."
1141,"I got the 10 feet of cable - it came in a bag.  It says CAT6 and is 10 feet long and has the CTG 'snagless' feature.  However, I thought these cables are made in the USA?  The bag I have doesn't say cables-to-go anywhere and it says 'made in china.' This is a Christmas gift - hope the thing works!  Go to CTG's website and they state all products made in the USA.PROS:ColorSnagless featureCAT6CONS:Authentic?"
1142,"A short review...Don't buy this product. The wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold. After a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about, the wire where it's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable; I have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work.Long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack...a serious design flaw. If you want to buy this, I suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your IPOD to support it's weight without pulling the wire off the connector."
1143,these are budget but good enough quality cases at a good price.  pleased with this purchase.  just what i needed.
1144,"They fit, they are not tiresome, the sound is clear. All of the features work flawlessly. People are very satisfied when I am on them, there is no strange sound to my calls. It comes with the short cable I need to use with my Panasonic handsets. It is light weight and having the controls on the line make it perfect for my use. If I needed another set for another location in my home, I would buy the same product again."
1145,"As of recent, this cable has been added to the cables to have on hand.  Typically, the TRS to TRS would do the task.  Now, this cable has been added as a cable to have in small confined areas."
1146,Beautiful sound.  Very clear highs and solid bass.  I also have Sony noise-cancelling phones.  I love Sony products.  Very dependable quality.
1147,A good cable for a reasonable price.  You can spend more on cables but this will get the job done.  So far no problems at all with this one.
1148,"I bought this CD-RW over a year ago, when I was still running Windows. It was pretty wacky then, doing all sorts of things to my discs and the OS! Dunno it that's the software or what...anyway last fall I switched my computer over to Linux and this burner has WORKED LIKE A CHARM! Linux users, note: Mandrake and SuSE both recognize this flawlessly. The program cdrecord will recognize it but won't let you use DAO ...however the app cdrdao works great with it (and it's frontend, gcdmaster)! I've burned over 200 discs with this burner I've bet and only a handful have been losers, and out of those I bet only 1 or 2 were due to things beyond my control. Cheap discs (don't get cheaper then PENGO I bet), pricey discs, all burn very well - some faster than others (the Blacks are the slowest at 2x, TDK or Fuji the fastest). I would buy Iomega products again."
1149,"I bought my unit to replace a older Sony stand alone.  It worked fine for 12 months although the FM reception was a bit disappointing for my 89.3 NPR station.  One morning it just......stopped......working.  I contacted customer support and they were completely indifferent.It now sits in my garage, a monument to poor quality and lousy customer service.  Sure looks good sitting out there though.2/16/09 update.  Last July I got tired of looking at it sitting in the garage so I contacted Tivoli and arranged to send my unit in for repair/replacement.  For a fee ( I think it was $50.00 but could be wrong) they sent me a new unit that worked pretty well until....you guessed it, the tuner has crapped out on it this weekend.  The FM band gives me nothing but static and noise.  I wish I could give a -5 star rating for this colossal piece of junk.You have been warned about this company and their crappy radios!  Buy at your own risk!  I should have listened to myself... :)"
1150,Color is way off - green tint throws off the overall contrast and the lens material is poor ( too much distortion). Got the neutral grey filter from Orion - WAY BETTER! Celeston quality control has gone by the wayside which is where I put this afterwards. Save your money.
1151,"I love these headphones; they've got superb sound (particularly the bass region--I didn't know headphones were capable of this kind of bass!), they're very portable, inexpensive, and the accessories &amp; features it comes with are great.  They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads.  I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus."
1152,"Although I'm not a computer novice, this unit was hard to install. While the green LAN (Ethernet) light came on when plugged into the router or DSL modem, it didn't work when plugged directly into my PC or laptop. Someone here wrote that in such case you need a ""crossover"" ethernet cable (or adapter). THANK YOU! I learned that routers have the smarts to figure our what type of unit is plugged in, and automatically assign transmit and receive signals to the proper pins. My PC and laptops didn't do that, and the DP-311U wasn't smart enough either. Hence I needed the cross-over cable (just for the one-time setup). Sad thing, before I figured this out, I spoke with 2 people at D-Link's technical support; we spent easily two hours. But neither one suggested the cross-over cable. They must have had tons of calls like this before. Of course, the manual says mothing about this either. Amazing how they waste time and money."
1153,"Using the Memorex CD Lens Cleaning Kit helped somewhat with my car's CD performance.  It did not eliminate the mistracking problem completely.  The player still mistracks sometimes on any disc that I play.  Currently, I have used the cleaner twice on my player.  Perhaps if I use it again and at regular intervals, the performance of the player will improve.  I did notice, however, that the lens cleaner kit has a suggested lifetime of just 30 cycles which is limiting.  Overall, I give it two (2) stars."
1154,"These Memorex CD-Rs did not work well at all for me.  I would not recommend them.I bought a spindle of 100 as the price seemed like a pretty good deal.  I tried burning 20 of these.  Out of that group of twenty, twelve were duds.I am no audio expert by any means, and there may be some great reason why they didn't work with my system.  Unfortunately, there was no warning indicating that they might not work well with certain types of computers.  The system that I am using is a Dell that was new within the last few months.I have also bought the Verbatim CD-Rs and had very good luck with them.  I would caution buyers to consider buying a smaller quantity initially if they are thinking about buying the Memorex CD-Rs."
1155,"This is my third Kensington trackball in the last 15 yrs.It's the worst one too.  Kensington also doesn't support MouseWorks for the Mac anymore and no plans to update it for Leopard.  I didn't try to install it.  The lower buttons work right as a normal click and right click.  The upper left button does something odd with the scrolling that I find irritating.  The upper right button... well I don't know what it does.The scroll ring is very nice and it's nice not to have to clean the rollers of the old trackballs (this one uses the red IR LEDs like modern optical mice do).  Beyond those two points, there's nothing nice to say here--If you're buying this expecting 1980s/1990s ""TurboMouse"" quality, you'll be disappointed.But if you're like me and need some varied input devices to keep your hands from aching with RSI from a single type of input device, this might be an OK purchase.  Otherwise, you'll probably wind up returning it."
1156,I needed cable and phone modem and it did not have phone hook ups so I returned it.  I thought I was over charged once it was returned.
1157,"I DJ all the time and I needed something that I felt would not steer me wrong. So these are the headphones that were recomended to me from a friend who is a dj also. I can turn and fold in about any direction you think of, and gives you a great quality of sound at the same time. I dont think I'd be able to get the same satifaction with any other headphones. I mean, what else can I ask for?!"
1158,GREAT BUT I ORDERED NOT LONG ENOUGH  4 MY APPLICATION....REREORDERED  50ft WORKS WELL FOR ME..I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE CAT 5 WIRE
1159,"I ordered an assortment of 1, 3 and 7 foot cables to connect 2 gigabit switches and half dozen PCs and two servers. I had been using older Cat 5e and felt it was time to refresh the cables.  I have tested the cables using my applications and they are performing as well as the 5e cables were doing.  The limit is in the applications, not the cables.I did notice that I was cussing while disconnecting the older cables.  You know, the ones with the little nubbin that refuses to disconnect.  I smiled as I connected the snagless cables.  Everything works as expected and I am a happy camper.  I have ordered another 4 cables to round out my refresh.Prices are right.  Performance is great.Oh, and I'm cussing less.Update ========================================================= (8 months later)I may have cussed less after threading these cables through my racks, but 8 months later I'm ready to replace them.  They don't snag, but after 8 months that little nubbin doesn't release anymore on several of the cables.  Not all, but enough so that I'd not use this manufacturer again."
1160,"This headsets retails from Sony for $149.99 which is not bad at all. The fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus. The cord is a 10 foot coiled cord that does carry some weight but is not to much to handle. The ear cup design is great, most sound becomes blocked out even before the music starts. The leakage isn't bad when the cups are over your ears but it does leak if a cup is exposed. The overall construction is pretty solid. They are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty. They flip up out and in nicely making a perfect fit for one under the chin or on the back of the head if you are trying to que up. You will hear sounds that you didn't know exsisted before. I'm not making that up either. These headphones are designed for DJ's to use while playing, that means they have to hear every line in the song. I've seen some people say that they aren't good for portability but I say their wrong. Yeah they are big headphones but no less portable than the over-rated Beats By Dre that take up just as much space. I highly recommend these head phones to any one willing to get rid of their ear buds."
1161,"I have had the S2 for over a year now. I have also owned both the V1 and passport 9500i.All had things I liked and disliked. This is my list on the Solo. I am listing them in order of importance to me.Like:-Cordless means a nice clean look in the car and since you generally need to hide this if your parked in public its nice to be able to just slide it off and stash it. The real plus is when your putting it back up you do not have to plug the power cord into it.-Display-Doesn't light up the whole car at night when it goes off (like the V1).-Battery Life-I go about 3 to 4 weeks with Eneloop low discharge rechargables. This was about a week longer than i was getting with throw away batteries.Dislike:-Range-its not even close to the 9500 or V1. If the radar is over a hill its near zero. If its around a bend you need to slow down immediately. Many times the warning has only provided 2 or 3 seconds to slow down. If the radar is over a hill and they are using instant on then hide your detector and ask for a break as this unit is just not sensitive enough to pick up a zap from an earlier car ahead of you. When this unit goes off hit the brakes. I have often visually seen the police car before this unit goes off if they are in front of me in traffic. This never happened with the 9500 or V1.-Volume-with the music turned up to a good listening level you can't hear the alert and the display doesn't stand out being basicly just lcd that you really need the audio alert to be louder.-windshield mount, suction cups wear out fairly quick. They have a better mount but the one that comes with it is good when the cups are ok but once they stop working thats generally it. A minor issue.Summary:If you cannot live with a corded model this is by most accounts the best cordless out there but make no mistake you will get no where near the warning or range of the best corded detectors, its just not very sensitive. I haven't owned any other detectors recently besides the V1 and 9500 so cant speak for the more moderately priced ones. I have had some close calls due to the lack of sensitivity of this unit and am close to retiring this unit because of it.update: I bought the redline about a year ago and its the best unit of any I have ever owned. If you live in an area without a lot of false alarms (9500i for those areas) its the best."
1162,"I had bought this as a spare keyboard for my laptop.  It may be slightly better for typing on than the laptop keyboard, but I cannot touch type on it.  The keys are not very responsive.  They kind of wiggle, so it's difficult to judge when you've actually depressed the key.  Perfect for throwing into your laptop bag or for a hostile or wet environment (repair shop, garage, etc).  Otherwise, pass."
1163,"I hade high hopes for this product but was dissapointed at the lack of power. There was too much noise even without a lot of movement. Perhaps I needed a more powerful unit, maybe ?"
1164,Write up suggests that it works with all of the Nikon cameras but it does not work with the D3100.
1165,"Picked up a 30-pack of these exact same CD-Rs after running out of Philips ones (which worked perfectly).3 out of 6 failed verification after burning. Additionally, the packaging doesn't have a hard plastic cover - it's just all held up by a piece of glossy wrapper, so the top 5 or so CD-Rs were already scratched, and the clear plastic CD-R top cover had 3 cracks. I verified that the 3 CDs that failed verificaiton indeed hang upon transfer.Going back to Philips or another brand. Memorex - never again (it used to be good years ago)."
1166,"I gave it 5 stars because for the price, these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you don't need an amp with."
1167,"Many years ago, I bought an earlier generation of these phones which I used for many years on business travel with an AIWA portable CD player to while away the hours.They disappeared after use by four of my kids while I was between trips. This new pair is once again a superbly made and designed high fidelity gift to anyone wanting really superb sound.Simply plugging them into a good receiver pumping out DVD sound, and you are instantly into the world of outstanding sound from the DVD and isolated from the sounds in your environment.  The bass, mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced and extend across a wider range than my large Boston Acoutic 150 speakers. After suffering with the sporadic connection failures and static in the individual plugs on the earpieces of a $300 Sennheiser earphone set (now gone into the trash) I'm happily back with Sony's V6 technology.The sound is better than the Sennheisers when they were new. The bass in the Sony's is spectacular and clean for any price range headphones.If these wear out before I do, I'll get another set of the same ones.  As long as Sony keeps making the MDR-V6, I'll keep buying them.The listing fails to mention that a very nice leatherette drawstring carrying caseis included to hold the phones and spiral wound cord when folded, just like the one that came with my first set many years ago."
1168,"Binoculars seemed great but when I looked through the eye pieces, the view was not synchronized, I saw two uncorrelated views.Returned and Amazon credited me the day I sent back the package."
1169,"It didn't work in my 99 Saturn OEM stereo. It just keeps ejecting. I found a number of work-arounds which involved taking the adapter apart. None of them worked. And to make it worse, this adapter is melted together so to disassemble it you have to break the plastic apart.Don't buy it if you plan to use it in a late 90s stock Saturn stereo. That probably goes for other GM autos as well."
1170,"I finally tried it when my cousin and I wanted to hear the game I was playing when everyone else were talking loud. Although, there were some loss audio in terms of volume but I think it can be tweaked to have both in its own individualized sound. Also, we used it on the computer and that's because I play my PS3 on an 720p HD monitor connected to my eMachines computer. I bought an Amazon Basics HDMI to DVI cable to make it happen. Anywho, sound can be diverted in so many ways when it's connected to a computer, I didn't have time to figure out how to have us our own sound volume and preventing the loss in sound volume. All in all, this is a great cheap device and if anyone is looking for a good headphone splitter, you should get this."
1171,"I bought these headphones because I thought they were high quality and lightweight.  I ended up having to use my cell phone wire clip to clip the wires to my shirt or else the left bud would pull on your ear.  These is no bass in these headphones.  Most of the reviews state good bass, but it feels like the treble is on 8 and the bass is on 2.  Very disappointed."
1172,"I am sure this is a good product, but the one I brought did not work properly. It could read and write Compact Flash and Smart Media cards, but when I inserted a Memory Stick or a Secure Digital card I was always prompted to insert a disc in the drive. That is, it did not recognize the latter formats.This must be a sample defect, but it was disappointing and I returned the drive."
1173,"As advertised, the 3M Notebook Privacy Filter does its job by masking what you are typing on the screen from other people. Someone seated right next to you cannot tell what is being typed on the screen...guaranteed. For people travelling on business with sensitive documentation, this filter is a must. For masking personal letters or emails, its a must.If you read other reviews from other websites stating it is possible for others to see the screen behind you, it's true. But it'll take someone with super, telescopic vision to be able to read the typing from that far away. If they are looking right over your shoulder, then you should have the right to give ther person a dirty look and tell them to back off. This filter's purpose is to mask unsuspecting eyes from spying from the side view in a crowded environment and that is what it does. It's not 100%, though...from a sixty degree angle, your screen will appear really dark, but it is more than enough to mask what you are typing.This 12.1"" filter fits perfectly into an IBM Thinkpad X40. It clamps right on it making it seem like a part of your notebook. There's no sticky adhesives necessary to keep it on.So why am I giving it only three stars? Well, in my opinion, there is absolutely no logical justification to make it so expensive! At most, I could understand if they charged this product for something like $24.95 or so, but asking for $80, retail, is just plain ridiculous. Even half that amount is too much. It's simply a piece of plastic. I was lucky and got mine at an auction for $0.99, but it is too pricy for private use, seriously."
1174,"It's really a trend with PC's these days, but the blue LED's on this are bright enough to completely light up my home office.  I ended up using electrical tape to cover them."
1175,"It says a lot about a product these days when it's been on the market for more than 20 years. With today's 2-3 year product cycle, old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast, forcing many once revered products into retirement. This is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is Sony; a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than 2 years. So why have they stuck around for so long? Simple; because they're amazing. No set of headphones in this price class (and several above) can hope to come close to how balanced these things are. All frequencies are represented accurately; just as they were recorded and without any coloration. Bass lines aren't bloated mess's like in many modern headphones, mid range frequencies are as they should be; in existence, and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears. Though not as detailed as a set of $500 headphones, these are not anywhere close to that. Hovering around $65 most days, these cans provide incredible value. Don't take this the wrong way; they're not amazing for what they are, they're amazing period. Buy these for editing, sound stage monitoring, or neutral listening and you won't be disappointed. Though if you buy these because you want ""street cred"" and bass that makes your heart beat backwards, you clearly didn't understand a word I said."
1176,"I do not know what it is, but you can buy every adapter there is and still be missing the one you need. I do use this a lot since it gives me the freedom to wander about a bit without being tethered so tightly"
1177,"Great Camera, great condition LIKE NEW. It takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with. The price was very low considering the great quality photos I can take with it. I couldn't be happier and I take it everywhere. The only disadvantage I can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find, and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera. It works with 2  CR2 2 V Batteries."
1178,"I bought these and it sucks!!! The only thing that is good about this is the comfort and can block outside sound. (3 different sizes....wow....(sarcastic)) You cannot share headphones because this is the type that goes behind you. If you have a lot of earwax....it will catch it!!! Yuck!!! The bass is okay, but not as loud than the other ones. The case that came with it was small and I dont know how to use it. The Sony MDRE828LP is alot better. It has the same amount of bass, louder sound, and the wind up case is well worth it. Oh yeah....its 3x smaller in $."
1179,"I received it today, and connected it to my primary pc.  As described in the manual, the little green light lit up.  A few moments later the little green light went out.  After that, the little switch never came back to life.  The keyboard and mouse would not respond.  Never attempted to connect my second pc.The receptacles for keyboard and mouse are not snug enough to securely capture the plugs. Any movement of the switch will dislodge the plugs."
1180,"I bought this camerata yesterday on the strength of the other customer reviews here, but today it went back to the store. My picture files had lots of pixels, but mediocre contrast and only so-so sharpness. I have owned both a Fuji Finepix 2400 and 2800, and both of these cameras took much sharper pictures than this Sony. My guess is that the culprit in the Sony camera is the lens -- all the electronics seemed to work OK.Update,  May 17Since writing the above I have purchased a Canon A70,  which is comparable in size and price to this Sony...with the same number of megapixels.The Canon gives the photographer a lot more potential control,  including,  if one wishes,  the ability to set f stops and shutter speeds manually.  Most important,  the lens is much better than the Sony's,  and my pictures are much sharper,  with excellent definition and contrast.  So in my opinion the Canon A70 is a much better value."
1181,"So if your on a budget for a little home project this will probably fit you fine.  If your doing pro work, a band that needs long lasting durable goods for travel, etc.  Then spend more money for something higher quality.I didn't think a cheap adapter would be much different than an expensive one, as an adapter is an adapter right?  Well not really these things are hollow inside!  I never expected something to be cheeped out like that.  Now I know how/why people said they bent these and broke them.Electrically speaking having it hollow should produce a signal just as good as a solid one (its not like your wire is that thick).  Mine were also gold colored not silver like in this picture.It should fit my needs fine just for a little home studio where I may have 2 mics and 1 other source hooked to a small mixer, if they break its not a lot of money to lose I just wouldn't want them to break if I was using them for a job or as a band when failure is not an option.  Thus why I say spend more if your in that situation."
1182,"I bought these headphones after my Koss earbuds finally developed a short after many years of use. I stayed with Koss because I had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod. And I was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones. But I didn't expect this significant an upgrade. When I first listened to them I was a bit overwhelmed by the bass. I had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this. But the more I listened, the more I loved it. I was simply hearing the bass in a way I had been missing with my earbuds. And I mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so it's not like I'm looking for a heavy rock bass here. I was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones (right now Gary Smulyan's baritone sax sounds amazingly full!).. And the rest of the sound is excellent as well. My only regret now is I'm getting used to this much bigger sound so I'm less blown away by what I'm hearing than when I first made the upgrade. But I have only to listen to some earbuds to get that &#34;wow!&#34; feeling again.Another feature which attracted me to these headphones which didn't dissapoint is their portability. I like to take my earbuds/headhones with me when I travel and don't want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space. These headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand. And they're very comfortable to wear. The &#34;comfort zone&#34; settings come in very handy. Moving the setting from &#34;firm&#34; to &#34;light&#34; makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel. I find that I prefer the setting right between the extremes (there are three settings in all).So, unless you've got something against '80s style and are concerned that you're just going to look too wierd with these things on, they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod (or, at least, that's what I use them with) that combines great sound and portability."
1183,"I've had this router for about six months, and about every other day, the router loses its connection, changing its flashing green lights to solid amber. I contacted Belkin, and they instructed me to update the firmware, which makes sense. But that didn't improve the problem at all. So to get the router working again, I pull its power brick from the wall, wait a few seconds, and plug it back. And it works for another day or two. This is a very frustrating experience.On the plus side, in my house of about 3,000 square feet, I generally have good reception."
1184,"Did not work for my brand of DVD player- GPX 5 year old antique from K mart. Wrapping does not specify which brand it will work for.  I now know that GPX not one of them. player did not read cleaner, cleaner did not clean lens.  I ended up removing cover on dvd plaYER, manually cleaning lens with cotton buds and rubbing alcohol- dvd now working again, no thanks to DVD lens cleaner.  Worth a try though- cheap price prompt delivery."
1185,"It is not working, i've tried changing the batteries but nothing, zippo. Made in China."
1186,"While I had no problem with the sound quality, I was only able to enjoy these headphones for a short bit.The headphones were too tight from the start and quickly made my ears hurts.  It's even worse if you wear glasses as it causes your earpieces to dig into your skin from the pressure.After a few short weeks of use the one of the tabs that hold the actually ear pieces in place broke.  These tabs that hold the ear pieces from moving are very small and it's amazing they even last more than a few days."
1187,"While my recorder worked I loved it. My wife bought it for me as a gift since I was always jotting notes on paper and losing them. This recorder was great for clipping to my shirt pocket and pulling out when I wanted to make a note of something to do. That is right up until one day the record feature stopped working. I had only had it three months. When my wife called the company they said it would cost $[price] to just take a look at it. This did not include any additional labor cost or shipping. Parts were covered since it was less than a year, gee thanks. Why isn't labor covered? Is Sony contracting out so much to cheap labor that they are not doing the quality work? I have seen numerous complaints like mine that indicate they are not interested in customer service. For this price wouldn't you agree it should have a year labor warranty as well?"
1188,"Good price for printer essential item. Seeing as how the scum bag printer people are scamming consumers by not including this item, this cable is a excellent buy! Radio Sh@ck sucks."
1189,I purchased this in January to use with my Nikon D80. I am just now getting around to use it and it does not work. This is not a Nikon product. This one is a KT-ML-L3 not a ML-L3. I plan on purchasing the ML-L3 that Amazon sells for $19.99. Don't waste your money on this one.
1190,"In brief, this antenna gave only sporadic success, and I found theHDTVaworked better for me.Before any antenna review I should let you know the environment in which I tried it.tuner: built into a new Philips 42"" plasma, model 42PF7320A/37building: tall single story on a high basement on a hill, plaster/lathe, wood sidinglocation: residential neighborhood, mostly single family homes, lots of large tall treesterrain: Urbana, IL - flat, only a few tall buildings 1.5 miles away on campustransmitters: check antennaweb.org for details, but in summary I have close stations in multiple directions and the furthest reception desired was from Decatur, about 35 miles west.This was the third antenna I tried after buying a new television with built-in digital tuner. First I tried the passive Radio Shack I'd been using for analog. This gave me only one digital station. Online research led me to want an amplified unit. Thanks to reviews here and elsewhere I wanted to buy a Terk, but found only a Jensen at first. This was worse than the RS; I returned it and got both the TV5 and the HDTVa. I really wanted to like the 5; I liked the appearance and so many people online say it works for them. It was the first to give me all stations if I worked at it hard enough. I could not repeat the results though. I had to move it for every single station. I don't just mean rotate it; I mean find a new place in the room. In contrast, it takes only two different positions for me to get everything reliably with the HDTVa.So, in summary, it does technically work, but I found it too unreliable. It may work better for you; a lot of people do seem to like it.One other warning: Check the dimensions. Online pictures and even the box didn't prepare me for the size of the unit. When assembled the wingspan was about twice what I thought it would be."
1191,"THREE YEAR UPDATE:It finally died! It got medium levels of use and under some hot conditions. I would have expected to last longer.TWO YEAR UPDATE:I now keep this in the (very very hot) car (in the desert) and it's still alive two years later. Gotta like that.I have given up on using the menu buttons since they are too distracting for driving. Still, it works as a good cheap-and-easy MP3 player.  Those little CDs are wonderful.----STRENGTHS:* It's [inexpensive] and the small CDs are [an inexpensive], handy format.  One little CD holds about four or five regular CDs when ripped to MP3.* It is relatively simple to use* I takes advantage of the open MP3 trend and the CD-R burners we now all have.* Efficient use of batteries. It seems like a pair of AAs last a long time -- certainly WAY longer than a traditional CD player.* Did I mention that it was [inexpensive]?WEAKNESSES:* Lower bitrate MP3s don't sound great or even work.* It really needs a lid/button lock.  It's quite easy to accidentally open or press a button.* It is a little clunky -- especially when compared to some of those cool MP3 or MiniDisk players.* The display is slow so you have to stare at it a long time to see all the MP3 tag."
1192,good product as most I have had fromm Belkin are and on here the price was good compared to local stores with the same product.
1193,"At last, the 6 Gig Mp3 player finally showed up!I don't care if the batteries last only four hours. Usually, 4 hours is enough, and you can still buy more rechargeables.Got a fast internet connection? Got Napster, Imesh, and found the our-mp3 site? Then this Jukebox will be worth every penny!Pros :  -6 Gigs, duh. -Fast upload. -Easy to use.Cons :  -Rather heavy, but it doesn't weigh more than my CD player(Panansonic with metal body).  -Plastic body that scratches easily.-For people who has slow connection, buy a cheap Mp3 player instead, because you will download for months until you obtain 6 gigs of music.At the end, there are some features missing from what I expected(random selection and smaller body), but 6 gigs... No more Cds, no more cheap Cd players... Woohoo!"
1194,"Wow, I thought I'd chance it with the negative reviews but got stung. Writing it off as a donation to the seller since sending it back is more of a hasle. When I tried all 4, the music sounds like Karaoke. I had to pull out the plug slightly on all of them to get the full signal/connection. Very poor construction. Just lousy. Probably made in China. Stay away from these."
1195,"brought these as temporary solution before my headphones arrivehorrible, even for this price it sounds like shitthrew away after a few minutessave yourself some troubledont buy this and go down street and get an ice cream"
1196,"I first bought these to go with a Discman many years ago. I review lots of classical music CDs here at Amazon and if I listened to them all via loudspeakers it would probably drive my wife nuts. So I often use these headphones instead. Another reason I do that is that I find that the sound they deliver is a clear analog of the sound I get from high quality loudspeakers. I find I can wear them comfortably for as long as I'm listening -- and sometimes that's hours at a time -- and never have the urge, as I do with other headphones, to take them off because of physical or aural discomfort.More recently I got an iPod -- my kids went together for my birthday and bought me the fanciest iPod available! -- and I find that these headphones are MUCH more comfortable and acoustically accurate than those darn earbuds that come with the iPod. I do notice that these headphones apparently have greater impedance than the earbuds; that is, the volume control has to be turned up a bit to get the same volume as delivered by the earbud. But the improvement in auditory accuracy and comfort is more than worth it.Thumbs up on this tried-and-true classic set of headphones.Scott Morrison"
1197,"These are good replacement speakers for GM truck. Sound is good for the size, I will buy again if needed."
1198,"I ordered this to help me transfer video from my camcorder to my laptop (its an older camcorder and uses tapes...)Anyway it works very well, however, its important to note that the cable is pretty stiff and since I ordered the 36&#34; variety that means that there is not a lot of length to allow for tight bends...which means that you could probably damage the ports on the device you are connecting to if you aren't careful.No complaints other than that.  Works like it should.  I just wish the cable was more flexible."
1199,"If anyone is considering, the Sony ICF-SW7600GR world band receiver radio, I suggest looking for another portable set.  I read the reviews and then made the purchase.  My main interest was to purchase a good shortwave radio.This radio cannot pull in the signal very well at all even after clipping an extension wire onto the antenna.I located an old Grundig YB305 portable digital shortwave radio to compare to the Sony.  The old Grundig is far a better radio then the Sony.  The Grundig YB305 pulled in every signal and locked on.  The Sony scanned right over them as if they weren't even there.  Here's a brand new Sony radio and I am going to have to see if I can get some warranty work to fix the problem.To compare the sound, I will say the Grundig YB305 is better.  There is a fuller rich sound for playing the FM music.  Sony is okeh, but not great.You would think that if it's a Sony it's gotta be good, but the Sony is a phoney.Currently I am only using the Sony as an AM/FM radio.I looked into warranty work and Sony will replace it with a refurbished one that may have cosmetic damage.  I didn't purchase this radio to trade it in on someone's old refurbished radio.  The cost to me would be the price for mailing the radio in, maybe $25.  $25 extra to listen to SW...that is if the replacement radio will work as intended.  Still taking a chance here.  I am now attempting to locate someone who can maybe fix my radio.  If not, I will continue to use it as an AM/FM only.In the old days the radio could be brought to a Sony repair station to be fixed.  There used to be one in the area but that is not the case now.  Getting someone else to fix it is not worth the cost as the total would equal the purchase price.Appears with the mass produced chinese @#$* products there is no quality control.  You may get a good one or you may get a bad one.  Word of advice, do not throw out the box right away like I did on trash collection day."
1200,These are really good headphones I had the Cl-20 when I was locked up and these are the sameones but they just aren't clear. You can't beat this quality of this headphone for this price. I have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they can't match koss. I love them and yes I would recommend!!!
1201,"This was the first router I bought and it was recommended by the Best Buy employee I talked to.  The installation was pretty easy and for a month this router worked excellent.  I had great range and it was reliable.  Then one day (about a month after I bought it) my wireless internet connection didn't work.  I didn't know what the problem was, but after resetting the settings, I had decent connection again.  Unfortunately this problem keeps reoccuring and about once week I lose my wireless connection causing me to reset the settings each time.  Its kind of annoying to be honest.Overall this is a good router when right, but outside of a month it hasn't been reliable for me.  I guess I would look for an alternative router if I were you."
1202,"I generally prefer Sennheiser's neutral sound.  Naturally, I prefer this bud over other brand's earbuds which tend to have boosted sound.  MX-400 has so far given me trouble-free service over 2 years of usage.I recently bought Sennheiser's CX-300 in-ear-canal buds.  At first, I didn't care for CX300's sound because bass sounded so pumped up compared to MX-400.  But over time, I came to be more appreciative of CX-300 because CX-300 still delivered neutral sound in mid and high frequency region similar to MX400 (after you listen to less bassy music) and bass isn't muddy.MX-400 is superior to CX-300 in:  1) touching line does not produce ""wind"" noise in your ear buds as is the case with CX-300, 2) MX-400 comes with a nice case whereas CX-300 doesn't."
1203,"I ordered this lens a few days ago. It came quickly. When I put it on my camera i was able to take a few pictures, but then it just stopped. It said I needed to clean my lens contacts, so I did. It still won't let me take any pictures though. I bought this as used-like new. Its not like new, it doesn't even work."
1204,"Don't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw.  As others have noted, there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on.  It's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not.  This is almost certainly a design flaw.  It could be aliasing noise, a leaky carrier tone, etc.XM is an interesting concept, but this boombox is poorly implemented."
1205,"Unbelievable headphones.although they may hurt on your head after 30-40 minutes, the sound quality makes them worth it ."
1206,"I want to say up front that I did not buy this from Amazon, I got it for free through another source. Even for free it's not worth the 3 cents worth of parts to put it together. Even the Chinese should be embarrassed over this piece of work! Absolutely awful product, stay clear."
1207,This cable is good made. Have a very nice structure an lenght too. It came to my house on time.Thanks
1208,Purchase an like item and was sent a subsitute. (Not what ordered) Got for a cheap price and that's exactly what I got. It works for a couple of minutes and the keyboard stops responding. Would not purchase again.
1209,"It works. That said, build quality very poor, and doesn't seem to transmit at a perfect rate, far from perfect, but still, works good enough."
1210,"Good basic electronics toolkit, the soldering iron and flashlight both leave a lot to be desired, but other than that a good basic electronics toolkit to have around the home/office."
1211,"Three stars is about as much as I would give a hub. There's nothing wrong with it. In fact, it works well. I just can't get my shorts in a twist over a hub.Pro's: Enough power for large thumb drivesPower Chord designed to take up only one slot on power strip.Does not run hot.Seven ports are better than 4.Transfer seems fairly speedy.Cons:  Why doesn't a USB provider make a hub with screw holes to attach it to a top or side surface?Parallel ports are closely spaced, too close for some drives and  dongles. You'd think that after figuring out the plug issue, they'd also realize that not all USB devices are slender. That removes the usefulness of a port or two.Computer cable and power chord in smack dab in center, which makes desk placement difficult.Still, it's probably the most practical hub on the market in the price range."
1212,"This thing installed OK per the brief cheat sheet included, but then when I tried to configure security I found that the instructions simply didn't work.  Not even close.  URLs listed in the docs resulted in DNS errors or 404s.  Called tech support once, navigated through the endless prompts and when I finally got dumped in the support queue, I was disconnected within a few seconds.  I foolishly tried again, navigated through all the junk again, and was *almost* in the queue when a recorded message announced that ""we're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.  Please check the number and try again.""  There's merely indifferent customer service and merely mediocre documentation out there, and then there's Netgear.  What a joke."
1213,I am very pleased with this DVD player.  I have played several DVDs on it and it has performed perfectly.  The picture and sound are great.  Can't beat it for the price.
1214,"Once you realize that you have to put a lens inside this before you attach it to your camera, it works great! If you didn't realize that, or didn't realize that there should be directions included (Gee, there's a concept), than you would think this is a horrible investment. Now that I figured out I needed to put a lens in there before attaching it to my camera, I'm very happy!"
1215,"In the last 15+ years, I tried a number of phone headsets by different manufacturers.  This one was the best --- lightweight, adjustable metal headband (not plastic), extremely comfortable, small unbreakable mic &#34;wand&#34;, easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control, and mic volume control, which is not common for headsets in this price range.  I used the previous headset for years until I moved overseas.  Now I'm back, I am delighted to have another one."
1216,"I cannot speak for Intel-based Macs, but these CD-Rs have given me problems on all my PowerPC based machines. My (beige w/ external burner) G3 refused to write them at all. My G4 (Quicksilver) did write them, but several times when I went to retrieve data from a Memorex CD-R, it was damaged. My G5 handles them fine, but the drive makes a horrid scratching noise that it doesn't with, for example, Maxell CD-Rs. Also, I was burning them in Joliet format for use on a PC, which may make a difference.When I called Memorex about my original issue, they told me my drive (the G3 external) didn't 'like' their CD-Rs, and that was that. Tough for me, eh? I will say they seem to work fine in PCs, and it may be some problem with Pioneer burners (both the G4 and G5 have these). All the same, I'd get a smaller package before I hauled off and bought a hundred of these if I owned a Mac, and especially a PowerPC based one."
1217,"I'm using the Sennheiser MX-500's exclusively with my new 4G 20GB iPod.  I purchased these because I've repeatedly heard that the Apple earbuds were pretty underwhelming.  I have not tried the Apple earbuds, and they're still in the anti-static sealed bag.Before I had these I was using an older pair of Sony MDR-A34 headphones.  Those are the buds that enter the ear perpendicular to the side of your head, mounted on a foldable above-the-head band.  As a reference, I considered the Sony's to not be so great.The first thing that you'll notice is that the Sennheiser's give you fantastic detail.  With the Sony headphones, I wasn't able to hear as much detail... I also couldn't tell the difference between the AAC files and MP3 files on my iPod.  While the MP3 files sound better than before, I can clearly tell that the AAC files are higher quality (yes, they are the same bitrate as MP3).However, with the increased clarity and detail, I have noticed that the bass isn't great.  I can still hear the bass, but it isn't so powerful.  This isn't a real problem unless you listen to hip-hop or classical jazz.  I listen to a pretty good variety of music, and haven't been bothered by this on a lot of other genres.  I particularly like the sound of live music, classic rock, and vocal-intensive music with these earbuds.I've read a lot of other reviews, and will comment on other features:- cord length is sufficient but could be longer.- the volume slider is very small, and very convenient.  Another reviewer made the comment that it's a ""linear"" volume switch.  To clarify, the switch slides along a linear axis; it is not a knob or dial, which helps keep the size small.  However, the volume is controlled by a logarithmic potentiometer, not a linear potentiometer... This is good, because humans hear on a logarithmic scale.  Just a friendly clarification for any other EE's out there who might care.- the buds seem to fit my ears, but I probably have big ears.... I definitely have a big melon.- the protective case works well, but isn't a special feature.At the end of the day, I'm very happy with the ~$16 I spent on these.  I highly recommend these to anyone who wants something inexpensive and highly portable."
1218,"Got these to monitor my new sony nx70u video camera. Like everyone says, they don't color the sound which is important when monitoring the sound from the camera. You don't want any unnatural enhancement that isn't really there. About the tightness, for me they are perfect.  They are not tight at all. I have an average size head for a 6'1&#34; 250lb guy. The cord is long too and it has a tight spring to it so that if you walk away from the camera forgetting that these are on your head you wont pull the camera off the tripod."
1219,"The product does what it says...I haven't had a problem with that. However, I got these as a gift, and all I received was an open package of 10 DVD+R discs and 4 cracked cases. I had to keep them for myself, which wasn't a big deal since I use them also, but it wasn't mentioned anywhere that the package would be tore open and the discs would just be thrown in there."
1220,"This device worked sometimes, but more often than not would drop data and slow to a crawl.  I cannot recommend it.  I'd recommend getting a wireless router, flashing with DD-WRT and setting it up as a bridge instead of purchasing this product."
1221,"Initially I bought these speakers because they looked really nice, were made by Sony and were cheap.  I guess none of that made any sense when I initally used them for music.  These speakers are just bad for music.  However, I got a job as a teacher a few years back and I used these speakers for audio books and they worked great."
1222,This did not work as advertised.  It really did not keep the volume constant and had loud annoying clicks during its attempts to lower the volume.
1223,"Seemed to be good quality and do the job. I am not an expert, so I bought one in a mid price range and was pleased until my Sigma 18-250 mm lens died after only 15 months (so warranty gone) Lens never seemed &#34;right&#34; from the start but completely dying in 15 months is the pits. So I can recommend the filter but not the lens"
1224,"Yep, I thought $30 was a pretty good price.  I thought $25.99 on sale was better, so I bought it.  Good looking, versatile, easy to use.  We really liked it (frankly, we never thought about it again) for the 10 *** Months *** that it lasted.  Yes, correct, months.  But what can you do, there aren't a whole lot to choose from.  Found a replacement for $20.  Hooked it with no prob, same as before.  It worked great for 4 hours and 35 minutes.  Then it turned off, never to function again.  Good luck finding one that works for a while."
1225,"I was hesitant to spend $75 on a pair of headphones, since I had always had pairs for under $30. My $25 Panasonics were great for the price, and gave excellent service until the inline volume knob started having a flaky connection.After reading the reviews on this item, I went ahead and bought a pair, and I am blown away by the difference in quality that extra $50 buys. The Sonys feel very well made, and they use metal and high quality plastics that make the headphones feel sturdy. I have no doubt these will last as long as the other reviewers are claiming.As for the sound quality, these are phenomenal. I am sure headphone purists will point out that their $700 Grado pair blows these away, but I haven't heard anything in this price range that even comes close.I play my bass guitar through my mixing board, and it is a 5-string model with the low string tuned to a low B. My old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when I played full volume on the low end of the B string, and I thought I was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board, but after plugging in the Sonys, I discovered it was actually the headphones. The Sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bass.My only complaint is it takes about 75% volume on an iPod to get a reasonable listening volume, compared to about 55% on my old headphones. However, if you plug them into an amplified source (such as a mixing board, headphone amplifier, home stereo receiver, etc) you should have no trouble getting good volume."
1226,"I'm on the computer 10-12 hours a day. I was hopeful that this device would help with my over-use issues in my right-hand. While I did experience some relief initially, almost a month later and I was back to square one, and the over-use issues had moved from my wrist to my upper hand.Might be helpful for temporary relief, but it is not a cure for tendinitis and over-use."
1227,"These are working in my home studio right now. Like most Hosa products, they work well and cost next to nothing. Good, no nonsense value."
1228,I must say this is not a bad filter for the money. I'd buy more for other cameras and lenses.
1229,I am a freelance camera operator and sometimes I end up having to edit projects.  Since I don't edit often I did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when I edited and this does just that.  I was so impressed I took it out in the field with me on sets and it's great.  I can't hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great.  I love these headphones.
1230,"I think these are great headphones. I have tried the Sony MDR-V6s (bought a pair and gave them away... couldn't stand them), some expensive Shure in-ear headphones (I felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them), and some Sony MDR-7506s.In the end, the V600s work the best for me (so far). They have great sound reproduction, I can wear them for hours at a time (and I'm super sensitive... I could wear the V6s for about 1 hour a day before I had to take them off), and they are a great value. The plastics used in their construction seem to be good quality, and they are aesthetically pleasing (not incredibly so, but they are certainly not ugly)."
1231,"I bought this keyboard for the same reason as others - to make more room to the right so I don't have to reach as far for the mouse. This keyboard works fine, but it takes more effort to press the keys. I gave myself a month to get used to this, but I never did. I consistently have more typos than I did previously. I finally went back to my old keyboard and I'm ""reaching"" again. Here's a TIP: to find more keyboard alternatives,  search on ""left-handed keyboard"". These have the key pad on the left. I wish I had thought of this earlier, because I could have found another keyboard that was almost identical to my old favorite keyboard. Sigh."
1232,"I read a review on the smart version of this switch, and I'll not be buying one of them now. That review said to buy one of these. Don't! I paid for two, they got super hot, and flashing lights of doom till they would not start again. I ordered replacement caps after reading reviews on these. Now one of my set of two works again. It still gets hot, and flashes the lights of doom. The other just never worked again. If you want to try some soldering, and buy some new caps. You might get one that works some times.updated: I find it very odd that some people are voteing these 1 star reviews down. By all means, if you would like to waste your money. Buy these up! If you like things that stop working, or you love fixing defective products for netgear. This is for you. It amazes me how self destructive people are."
1233,"I'm using this currently on my Canon 50mm f1.4 lens for day time shots and to reduce unnecessary glare aside from better saturated colors if not add some warmth.Construction is great, solid, no distortion looking at the filter and the 58mm fits perfectly on my f1.4 lens.  Like any filter you'll find the lens cap won't be a solid fit as the thread on the opposite end isn't as tall.  But the cap will stay there but just be sure to watch for any bumps that may cause it to come off.The range which it cuts the glare on glass, windows, water and any reflective surface is great.  The sky can look washed out all the way to saturated darker blue color with clouds popping out while depending on the orientation you can add a cool or warmer feel to the photos.I've used Heliopan and B+W so compared to the pro-grade filter, you'll probably find that this polarizer isn't the best out there but for the price it does what it's supposed to.  When I had B+W 77mm multi-coated CPL ($150 here) on my Canon 70-200mm lens, the sky really popped with dark saturated blue skies and the control was better.Overall it's a great polarizer.  Unless you absolutely need more saturated colors and reduce glare to the maxium then go with the more expensive multi-coated filters.  I would say this Tiffen filter is a standard for circular polarizer and won't disappoint.  Plus it protects your lens like any UV or other filters used.  I'd rather smash a $20 filter versus a $400 lens.Circular polarizer does make daytime shots more fun and less correction post processing.  And sometimes you can't control everything you shoot with so a filter becomes a must in some cases.  With a lens that can be as wide as f1.2-f1.8 sometimes putting the ISO level 100 doesn't always allow you to shoot at the widest aperture.  In a sense it does act like a neutral density filter to a degree while cutting glare and allowing you to shoot a fast moving subject or freeze the moment."
1234,Review date 06-27-2011.  Have had two in our household. Each functioned flawlessly for approximately 2700 hours (10-12 months at 8 hours per day).  Left mouse button becomes unresponsive requiring the user to press excessively hard and/or repeatedly to get a response.  Only gets worse with time. When shopping for a replacement the second time around I found reviews at other sites where others complained of the same problem.  My conclusion is that the Microsoft Wheel Optical Mouse is no more dependable than a $5-$7 mouse.
1235,"I had bought several of the wal-mart variety headsets and was getting pretty frustrated with their quality, lack of mute feature, etc, so finally I decided to spend some real money.  I have a Plantronics headset at work that is decent, so I bought this one.  It's even better than my headset at work!It is convertible from headset to earpiece (for those who like that sort of thing.  The little padded thingy for the earpiece (when used in headset configuration) is very comfortable.  I don't notice any discomfort even after 3-4 hours of usage.  There is a mute switch on the wire, and both the earpiece and microphone volumes are adjustable.I have only had mine for a month or so, so I can't comment on the durability issues yet.  Apparently, I'm not as acrobatic as some reviewers, so I don't expect problems.I really can't think of anything that I do not like about this piece of equipment."
1236,...what it's advertised to do.  I got these to hook up duel headsets to a PS3 and they work well for this.
1237,"I'm taking a digital music course this semester, and so the class requires a pair of high-quality headphones in lieu of a textbook. Being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody else's dime, I settled down to research. After hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores, I finally settled on the Sony MDR-V6, having been warned away from the newer Sony model that was supposed to replace them. Obviously the ear cups haven't died yet, but I know they will in a few years, and I don't mind at all.I just got them in earlier this afternoon, and I haven't taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary. I've been listening to music for hours now. The biggest fear I had with buying new headphones was that they wouldn't be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance. After about an hour of listening to Emilie Autumn's electric violin, which has both in abundance, I have to say that my fears were laid to rest. I then moved on to the rest of my music library, and so far - with only a few hours of breaking-in - it all sounds amazing. Metal, rock, classical, reggaeton, electric, jazz, trance, everything. There's a touch of bass that I can't usually hear, and I'm not sure if that's enhancement from the phones or just because I can actually hear better now, but I like it.All in all, one of the best not-a-textbooks I've ever bought, and I see myself loving these way after this class is over."
1238,"This radar wasnt worth the price. if you are willing to pay 300 for one, you might as well just pay the extra 100 for a better model, i.e. the valentine one.  The solo is nice, and it works occasionally, but if you are serious about your radar detectors, this one just doesnt do what it should for $300."
1239,"As an avid 35mm photographer, I've put off going digital because the cameras themselves are so limited compared to SLRs.So, first: The 3200 is a fixed focus, wide angle camera. It has a digital zoom feature, but it's only available when your using the lowest quality image setting. And, as a very picky 35mm photographer, I should point out that even at the higher quality settings, you shouldn't expect to get high-quality prints larger than snap-shot size.*BUT*: Given the resolution of the camera, the quality of the images is excellent; My first use of the camera was on a disney vacation, and I gave it a huge work-out. I added a 48 meg memory card to it, shot hundreds of photos, and really appreciated the ability to delete pictures right out of the camera - that way you can go crazy take a ton of pictures, then delete the ones that didn't work out.I'd give the camera five stars, but the fact that it doesn't come with a video cable or memory card is kind of frustrating. The built in 2 megs isn't enough memory to do anything except test the camera."
1240,"I've owned many different headphones before, including aSony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil(an incredible headset in its own right) and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of AKG K701 Studio Headphones, and these are, easily, my favorite. I will always love my Sony MDR-V6, but due to a recent change in my listening needs, I needed a pair of open cans, portability being a huge plus. I considered the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone but those didn't really look very comfortable, and aren't particularly portable. I gave these a shot, and considering their price and heritage, why the heck not?I have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans. They are amazingly comfortable, probably the most comfortable set of cans I own. The ComfortZone system really works, and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads. Why Koss or another company hasn't implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me, it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening, or increase the pressure when you're moving around. Of course, these aren't sport phones and are less than optimal when you're very active, for that I would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones. I haven't found the headband to be uncomfortable at all, but I do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it. You might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about, but I haven't had that problem yet. The portability is respectable, they do fold up into, as someone says, a pokey baseball. The case is pretty worthless and too small, but whatever, its really not necessary. The looks, well, are subjective. I think they're very unique and in a way personify the anti-""Beats by Dr. Dre"" look, which in my book is a great thing, but most normal people might not agree. Who cares what they think :)And of course, the most important aspect, the sound quality. I find these sound absolutely excellent. The response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response, so these won't be any good at studio monitoring or mixing, but they also don't need a ton of EQ adjustments to make listening enjoyable, unlike my V-6's. Personally I only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit, and they sound great like that. Very detailed, bright, punchy, and excellent response across the entire spectrum, except for the extremely low end of the spectrum. To get solid response in the sub-20Hz region, you're probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers. It just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point. Other than that, the sound is amazing, there's really nothing else to say. Just make sure to give them a good long break-in period.A word of warning I should mention, is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition. The first set I had poor bass in the left channel, in about the sub-100Hz range. This is one of those defects that's hard to detect since bass isn't directional, and for awhile I though maybe I was going crazy. I was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually (by pulling the other away from my head) and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method. Amazon was great about the replacement, and my new set is perfect.My only criticism about these cans would be the way Koss packs them. They wrap the chord up so tight I doubt the kinks will ever fully come out. I observed the same quirk with the KSC-75, Koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords. This annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are. Replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod, and one I'm considering doing. Then again, that would probably void the excellent lifetime warranty.Overall, these are an amazing set of cans. There really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try; they've been made the same way for over 25 years, and once you use them, you realize why they shouldn't ever change a thing. They're a true legend, and even if the price was double what it is, they would still easily be worth the money. Recommended without any reservation whatsoever.Oh and a note about the photos, the actual plug is a gold-plated straight plug, unlike the steel right-angle plug in the picture. The 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter is entirely gold-plated as well."
1241,"I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through."
1242,"I doubt I'll ever use all the tools even in this small kit, but the ones I have used perform very well. When you need a tool for fiddling with your computer, it's nice not to have to worry about 'where it's been.'"
1243,"I have a hard time finding earphones - buds don't stay in my ear for a second, so I was hoping these would work. They are pretty big on my ears, even though I have big eras. Maybe my ear holes are small. For running, they don't stay on whatsoever. I had a pair of monoprice hook on earphone that I loved but they no longer make them. If you have trouble keeping headphones in your ears, get an inner ear style, not these."
1244,"I've owned a Casio E-series Pocket PC since September 1999 and continue to use it daily at work, primarily for taking notes during meetings and reminding me of appointments or special events. Casio's E-series devices has a well-earned reputation of posessing the best screen for indoor viewing and fairly good reliability, at least compared to the original Compaq iPAQs, their leading competitor.  If you are considering migrating from the Palm platform to Pocket PC, or you're entirely new to PDAs in general, the Casio E-125 is a good bargain -- it's cheaper than the ""latest & greatest"" units since it has been out for well over a year and has no upgrade path to the new Pocket PC 2002 operating system but still provides all the functionality one typically uses a PDA for -- note-taking, date and appointment reminders, news reading (AvantGo) and occasional ""fun stuff"" like viewing MPEG movies and listening to MP3s.If, however, you want to get the most from your Pocket PC investment -- meaning you want to explore the latest technology has to offer -- I'd recommend going with one of the Compaq iPAQs, since the entire line has flash-upgradable ROM (Read Only Memory) such that they can be upgraded quickly and inexpensively to the latest Pocket PC operating system. None of the Casio E-series devices have this feature, nor any other upgrade path to the new OS. Further, the new operating system supports ARM processors only, and the older E-series Casios run MIPS processors, meaning over time the number of new applications being developed for MIPS-based Pocket PCs will surely decrease.  Still, if all you need are the features I mentioned above without the upgrade path to the newer OS, it's hard to beat the price of an E-series Casio."
1245,"Summary:  A lot of the positive reviews are quite old.  The version of the product that shipped at that time (2002-2004) was GREAT and deserved 5 stars.  The version that is shipping now is a pale imitation of the original.  If you are considering one of these backpacks, do not rely on the early reviews because the product is NOT the same.Detail:  Over the last 5-6 years I have owned 3 of these backpacks.  The one currently shipping (see ""Version 3"" below) is NOT as pictured.  Here's a quick recap:Version 1:  My original backpack - purchased in 2002 or so - this version of the 15.4 Targus Gravity was well made and included both shoulder straps and a strap you could buckle around your waist.  Given the volume the bag holds, these were very nice features because a heavily loaded pack (in my case full of lots of books and a much heavier 2002-era laptop) was surprisingly comfortable to carry around.Version 2:  When my original bag wore out (I'm pretty rough on them - no fault of Targus there) I wanted to buy the identical model.  I thought I had - they had the same model number after all.  Not so.  (This purchase was made in 2006 or 2007.)  The bag I received was otherwise identical to Version 1, but Targus stopped including the waist strap.  I was pretty annoyed at this, but eventually got over it as I was unable to find anything better.Version 3:  In November 2009, my second backpack wore out.  As with before, I wanted to purchase the IDENTICAL laptop bag.  Hence, I searched for and bought the IDENTICAL model number - the Targus RG0318 15.4 Gravity.  Guess what, they changed the design AGAIN!  They removed one of the two zippered side pockets, leaving just the useless mesh holder that things will fall out of if you ever set the bag on its side, toss it into the back of a car, into the overhead bin of a plane, etc. etc. etc.  USELESS.  Also, the interior materials are much cheaper and have a mass produced quality to them.  They replaced the cool foldable document holder (that would keep papers nice and flat and out of the way) in the main compartment with a cheap velcro pouch.The stock pictures you see listed are for what I call Version 2 above.  I.e. they are OUT OF DATE and do not show the current instance of this backpack.  If you buy the model now you will NOT get two zippered side pockets as shown, but only one.Dear Targus: If you are going to change your product offerings, that's fine, do whatever you like, but DO NOT NAME THEM ALL WITH THE SAME MODEL NUMBER!  It's a huge difference to get rid of a belly strap and then get rid of one of the zippered side pockets on a product like a backpack.  These aren't mild cosmetic updates.  They are fundamental changes to the product's usefulness, and changes for the worse at that."
1246,Good cord but doesn't fit in nicely with my Epson printer.+ in picture the color shown is black but they delivered me a white one.
1247,"...master of none.PRO: *holds over a thousand tracks. *sounds great. *versatile output: headphones, small speakers, auxiliary jack on stereo, pc. *power adapter--charges batteries too. *fairly portable. *simple operation when connected to pc. *bells and whistles with eq presets, recording, stuff I've never had the patience or knowledge to use well. *you can add to the current play queue from the library without interrupting the music. *it doesn't skip, really. *the ability to save playlists and edit them on the fly, to reduce a thousand tracks worth of cds to the small size are really worth whatever you choose to spend on the privilege.CON: *not ""All your music, wherever you go,"" as billed-but plenty of music anywhere you'd care to carry it. (There are far larger hard drives for sale since I got mine almost 2 years ago). *it's as bulky as a portable cd player and heavier than most. *the battery power runs out too quickly. *the user interface is lacking-you can get there from here, but you're going to be hunched over your magic jukebox for a few minutes while you wait on slow refresh rates and clumsy controls. (Although it is feature-rich, it is clearly an early attempt at bringing the power of the technology into the hands of the average user.) *it's almost as noisy as my laptop. *the IR port on the front of it is smoke and mirrors, a yet unfulfilled indication of future functionality. *you can't create a playlist on the pc and drag it to the jukebox without re-uploading those tracks to the device. *this particular model came with nothing I cared to have in the way of pre-installed music and an unattractive, inconvenient carrying case, an extra set of rechargeable batteries-and cost significantly more than the no-frills ""C"" model of the jukebox that came out about six months later.Though it's not everything I'd hoped it would be, and though the user interface is really annoying, it does make life very convenient and it sounds greatNote: I have actually considered buying a newer rev of this with more disk space and a dial to facilitate scrolling through lists. They are available now with tons of space and are viable replacements for a shelf full of cds in your living space--if the functionality has improved alongwith the disk size."
1248,"I use this with a 4+ year old Powerbook G4 that came without bluetooth. I plug it in and Mac OS X recognizes it. It works fine since. However, this adapter only supports older bluetooth standard, so file transfer is slow, peaking at ~70KB/s."
1249,I have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when I had to replace the one I had I found it here at Amazon.com and not only were they new but they were the least expensive I could find anywhere. Some site were asking as much as 4 times what I paid here.. Thanks once again Amazon.com
1250,"Good sound quality, but I found them very cumbersome to put on and were somewhat uncomfortable while wearing. Discontinued using them and bought another pair."
1251,"I bought 2 cards.  One card works perfectly.  The second card, after uploading pictures to my Mac, when put back in the camera had to be reformatted.So, this review gives one card 5 stars and the 2nd card 0.  Hence, the 3 star rating."
1252,"Coupled with a 25-ft cord, Y-splitter and 2 sets of headphones, this is a good way for 2 people to listen to TV or play video games after the rest of the house has gone to bed. This will only stretch out about 10 feet before it starts to tug  against the headphone line but it's lightweight enough that you can deal with that. Adapters are useless unless you plan on using them in a foreign country or on a plane. I threw mine away."
1253,Purchased this for action replay and it's not compatible. Use it for other things so nbd. Live and learn. Lol
1254,"I have always preferred headband style radios over armband radios while running so I am in a constant search for the right one. Too often, Sony and others develop their headband radios, which are fairly obviously targeted to joggers, exercisers, and other active people but then forget about that target in final production. I've used previous models of headband radios that provide superior comfort and stability on the head. Early on the problem was that they would rust out from the salt in my perspiration. Newer models have solved that problem but created another. The &quot;Street Style&quot; behind the head technique of wearing this unit has a lot of promise. But it can be very uncomfortable to all but the smallest heads. They should really fit these to a regular sized western male instead of to a tiny Thai women. That said, it does have a stable and quiet fit even after several miles. But it will hurt your ears a bit.As to reception and sound. Well...I've seen it better in other units. I won't say it is poor. But it could be better. And I know this because I could compare it to another Sony model (the analog tuning twin of this one). The mega bass isn't as mega and the FM capture is weaker. The weather and TV bands are neat but not very practical. And I have some concerns about the funky sliding battery cover. It works, but I just don't trust it. One plus is that the ear units attach to the loop internally. My last pair had a metal set screw that rusted and broke.  All in all I give it 3 stars, average, and I will keep it until I find a better one. A redesigned and lighter version of the flawed SRFHM55 would be the trick. Get it together Sony!"
1255,Not much to say about this one. The item works as expected with no flaws or problems. It gets about 8 hours a day of use.
1256,I bought another brand for new laptop and tried this on my wifes laptop. She didn't like it so now I have something to clutter my technology drawer.
1257,"Says I can enable the router hardware firewall, to protect me when I have to temp disable my KIS software firewall, but couldn't figure out how?-I Called their hard-to-understand TS (3-times!), but their Clueless techs kept saying it wasn't necessary (NOT!)???BAH-HUMBUG!  :o("
1258,"After 3 weeks of testing and research I figured out what the problem was. It appears that graphic cards use a fair amount of power and causes a lot of electrical inference. When this interference hits a pair of amped speakers the inference gets magnified and then gets projected as undesirable noises.  This noise would instantly go away whenever I exited a graphic game and would start back up when I reentered the game.  I had to buy a Dual XLR sound card (not cheap) and 2x XLR -&#62; XLR cables to get rid of the inferences.If you just plan to listen and create music without playing games this cord should work for you. This cord is not at fault, rather all 3.5mm plugs are inherently flawed to pick up interference.  You wouldn't normally hear the 3.5mm inference on cheap desktop speakers or headphones because they aren't amped enough."
1259,"Basically, this thing has a really weak transmitter. I tried using this indoors with both a Denon receiver and a cheaper Sony receiver. Nothing came through on those receivers, though the TuneCast was able to interfere with a couple stations. Sadly, there was even less audible on the frequencies with no stations.Fortunately, I did find a frequency in my car, and the Alpine head unit was able to pick up a signal. I was able to use it for a while... the static wasn't too bad. However, as soon as I drove within range of any other signals, no matter how weak they were, the TuneCast was totally overridden. This thing probably needs about 10 dB of gain to be a viable transmitter, even for a range of 10 feet.Quite simply, check your airwaves for 88.1, .3, .5. and .7. If you're in a large city or college town, those frequencies are probably littered with college radio or public access stations... no matter how weak they are, they will dominate this guy.Avoid this. The Griffin iTrip works reasonably well, and is a better allocation of your hard-earned funds."
1260,"Worked great until it broke. Had it for about 3 months, always handled it very carefully, but then it just stopped working right... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird, and ultimately unusable. :("

1262,Inexpensive and simple way to make sure you are not accidentally frying one of you chips when poking around inside your computer. It is easily adjustable to fit my wrist and the coiled cord extends without much force (as it should).
1263,"At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to (you know to be safe.) IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the ""Verify Written Data"" check-box checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse."
1264,"Interesting....because my last review wasn't nearly as bad as it'll be now. I kindly mentioned before the headphones were functional along with the negative things I had to say. Well, let's skip the positive and go to negative since they felt the need to ""get rid of"" my last review somehow.Took their sweet time sending it (sitting in limbo for a couple of days on the tracking).Not the item pictured. I expected red like the ones in the photo, instead I got these cheap black looking things."
1265,"These are great!  Many over the ear phones don't allow for much adjustment for head size, but these can accommodate a wider range than most.  In addition, each ear cup can swivel independently.  I've used them for many years now, primarily while running.  They fold up somewhat for storage.  I've owned several of them, and only once did one go bad--a wire going into the cups came loose.  Hours of sweat on the foam cups hasn't hurt them.  I can't speak about sound quality, because of all the noise I generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination.  They fit, they last, they are comfortable."
1266,"I purchased these on Black Friday, I use them for my Ipod Touch 4th Generation. The sound these produce completely removed the need to use any EQ settings on my IPod.I mostly listen to Pop, Rock, and Rap so I can say Highs are great, Mids are good, bass is excellent and clear,and no noise distortion.I can't speak to how well the build of the Headphones will last overtime, but so far they seem durable.They are a good choice if you plan on owning a HIGH QUALITY or audiophile version of headphones.The only thing I absolutely HATE is the LONGGGGGGG CABLE. I can't work it with it, it dangles over my legs,jumps up and down with me. If Sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy, Beats, Souls, Audio Technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphones."
1267,"I plugged these headphones into two sources--a computer and a high quality boom box. I made certain that on both trials that the plug was pushed in ALL the way as if you don't, the result can be mono sound. No sound comes out of the left side. I tried and tried. I even looked on the headphone set and the ""in-line"" volume control to located a balance (left and right) control.The ""plus"" about these headphones is that they are very light weight and they come with an additional adapter which allows the user to convert from 1/8"" plug to 1/4"" plug as it is commonly referred to. Another plus is the brand name KOSS, but what went wrong here? At least, these were my findings. I was always able to get proper sound out of ""other"" headpones on the two above devices--even with extension cables. Another plus is the volume control.The integrated adjuster knob slides easily in both directions and allows the user to go from mute to very loud. The KOSS inline volume adjuster that was offered as a group purchase with this item,wouldn't allow a complete mute or that significant of a raise in volume.At least,that was my experience! The adjuster knob protrudes enough to make it easy to locate by ""touch""--unlike on the inline only volume adjuster mentioned above. These headphones also have a gel-like blue material that makes contact with the top of your head and this adds to the comfort.**=> Post Script/Update...After I submitted the above review indicating ""NO SOUND WAS COMING OUT OF THE LEFT EAR PIECE,"" I removed a 3 foot 1/8"" extension cord which I had incorporated into the separate connecting of these headphones to my computer and boom box.""Without"" the utilization of the 3 foot extension cable, sound came out of BOTH left and right sides of the headphones. However, I've been using this same 3 foot extension cable with my SONY headphones and sound comes out of the left & right sides of those headphones. The cable is only one week old. When I connected the Sony headphones to run a test, they worked. Even,in the past,when I've used ""20"" foot extension cables for headphones,this did not affect the functionality of the headphones.I would have liked for those headphones to have worked,but my experiences were not positive with them--quite the opposite!"
1268,"I've owned the V600, the 7506 and the V6's.  I've been happy with all three, though if I had to pick, I'd take the V6s.  And I'm fairly critical when it comes to headphones.  Anyone trying to divine perfection among these three really needs to go audition all of them to see which they prefer.  They differ, but are comfortable, yield high-quality sound, and are well-made.  I wouldn't have a problem recommending any of them.  The differentiators are these: the V6 and 7506 are almost identical (though the 7506s are more expensive), are flatter in response and more suited to studio use.  The V600 is a mass-market headphone well-suited to general listening use with a sound that tends toward warmer and bassier.My current set of V600's is getting pretty tired, and I'll probably audition all three again myself.  To anyone reading reviews to figure out which to buy, my advice is to not over-analyze it - unless you already have a preference, buy whichever is the best deal at the time.  Chances are, you'll be more than happy.  Sony makes superb headphones."
1269,I love this lens. It's great fun to have the special tool you need when you want to work really close.
1270,"so sweet and sublime, there isn't anything here that shouldn't be.  great separation and pure, rich sound as it was intended.  awesome, flavored with old-school cool.  buy a pair and find out for yourself.  rock on."
1271,"My husband loves listening to music when he goes to bed, and I hate it. He suggested I get these for him so that he can listen and I can sleep in peace. I think I love them more than he does! He used to use just ear buds and I could hear what he was listening to plain as day. I can't hear anything when he is using these headphones. He says that the sound with these are fantastic, like you're in a home theater. We both think they are worth the money."
1272,Has other reviews state. The set up won't stay right on your ear. I have opted to keep them for back ups. Just placed an order for the SECUDA throat mic. It should work well with my Midland GXT5000.  I need to be able to count on my gear. These don't give the confidence I would like for my needs.
1273,"I ordered the Monster THXV100F8WHT but instead received an inferior cable the Monster SV100F-8 WHT. I already had opened the package before realizing I had the wrong cable in hand. Gathering from what I read about Amazon's return policy I could no longer return it due to already opening the package, however upon contacting them, Amazon refunded my purchase and issued a return label. So I am happy to report Amazon did their best to make things right. Hopefully anyone else ordering the THXV100F8WHT will get what they paid for. The cable I got appears to be Monsters bottom of the line."
1274,"I don't claim to be all that knowledgable about cameras, films and photography, but for the uninitiated, this is as good a camera is you could possible need if you're anything like me. My 70 year old father, who'd not taken pictures in years, picked up the basics pretty quick.The camera is old and a bit clunky for today's streamlined standards, but for someone like me it makes it harder to drop and the photos are as good as newer models (if not better).The biggest grumble for me is the memory card. It takes SmartMedia cards which are smaller (memorywise) and more expensive."
1275,I had not problems installing and using this unit.  I am running thicker speaker wire (12 gauge) and had not problems getting it to stay.  The terminals could be a little beefier but it works fine.  Now I can control my speakers separately.
1276,These pads mostly reduce vibration by increasing the surface area of the tripod feet. They have some sort of dampening material sandwiched between the top and bottom of the pads. It feels overly hard to the touch (but is probably correctly damped when loaded) and the pads seem very expensive for what you get. I would suggest you try making your own first unless you are happy to pay for this product.
1277,"These earphones are well put together and at the price they could be outstanding. The volume control alone make them a steal. The problem is that being behind the neck there is no adjustment for size. You can't wear them while relaxing in a chair because when you lay your head back, the earphones try to rip through the front of your ears. Add to this that there is no foam cushioning to the phones themselves and they are hard plastic circles than insert into your ears and it makes for PAIN.Unless your ears are large enough to accomodate 1/2 inch discs inserted into them SIDEWAYS (like inserting dimes into your ears edgewise), you will not like the feeling.Add to this the fact that the speakers face forward instead of into the ears, and you have the problem of having to raise the volume higher than necessary.So instead of a well designed product you have one that is badly designed from every aspect. These could be great earphones if Koss would make them adjustable, reduce the size of the speakers and turn them 90 degrees so they direct the sound down the ear canal and finally add some foam padding to cushion the speakers.The quality is excellent and the volume control is substantial and well made, not flimsy like most that I have seen. A company like Koss should know better."
1278,"I've had these headphones on at a reasonable volume, and I cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me.  The sound quality is excellent.  I want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine."
1279,"After a lot of reasearch, I picked up this camera, used, for $18.  I knew that it was a very simple model, initially aimed at youth, but oddly containing an expansion port.  And with that expansion port, I added an additional 32 megs of memory.  So at high quality, which is only 640x480 on this unit, I can take 130 pictures at a time.Now, before you start thinking this is the best thing you ever saw, it is very simple.  If you're used to your Olympus Stylus not letting you take lousy pictures, this one will let you take those lousy pictures.  It's greatest weakness is backlighting, but if you can alter the gamma with your software (and the stuff that comes with it is that standard dumbed down garbage) you'll be able to compensate.Great for playing with, taking pictures of the cats, cars, and sunsets.  But don't do the wedding photos with this one.  But by adding a $10 32 meg expansion, you have much more capacity than many of the low end ilk.  And if you want smaller, look up the Philips Key007."
1280,I've had this model for years. I'm happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call. I've used this model for over 8 years with a Radio Shack headset amplifier and the Nortel and Polycom phone systems. Love it.
1281,"I've been using Cyber Acoustics low end speakers for a few years.  I just wanted speakers for a pc I put together myself, and they were clean although a bit tinny.  I like to hear vocal and piano, and they get by.  I just got this 3 piece set as an upgrade, and although the two peripheral speakers are a bit better than my original pair, the boom box kicks out bass even when I turn it off on the right speaker (which is the only control over it I have as my sound card has very limited controls).  To me the boom box is an over compensation...like saying ""now let's add bass.""  I've faced it against the wall and put a towel over it.  I'll probably give these to a friend, and get their two speaker product.  The only reason I have to do that is the power supply runs through the boom box first, and then to the periperal speakers.If you like clean peripherals and want to feel the booming bass, this is a good set for the money, especially when shipping is free."
1282,"I purchased this install kit to replace the factory stereo on my 1997 F150 XLT.  It almost made it into the correct place before breaking!  The install kit is plastic, and adaptable for different vehicles.  Maybe that is why it is so fragile.  The fit was poor, leaving gaps at the top of th plate.  I should have bought a more expensive install kit!"
1283,"TWO YEAR UPDATE:After two years of use, I love it more and hate it less.It is worked WIHOUT FAIL on daily use. I can't say this about most of my electronic gear. I use it mostly for ""time shifting"" of my favorite radio programs. I also use it to listen to books on tape (which I've dubbed over)... again it is a great product for this. The bookmarking feature is wonderful for keeping track where you're at in the book.I now have the SonicStage version 2 and it is much better. Still not great... but much more useable.--------------I use my MD player every day so, obviously, something is right about it. I actually own two!But I also want to write a cranky email to this engineer at Sony signed off on the software! It is AMAZINGLY bad!  SonicStage (1.5 is my version) is SO counter-intuitive that I just can't use it... and I'm pretty savvy with computer stuff. LITERALLY -- I can't use it.I can't figure out any way to just drag-and-drop songs to the player in the SonicStage software. Why in the world not? It's baffling.Instead Sony makes you go through this ridiculous ""check in check out"" process. (or is it ""check out - check in""?)  It makes no sense to me.  Maybe if you grew up on right-brained computer games like Mario Brothers, you could just let go of the need for logic.FORTUNATELY, you can get a plug-in for RealAudio which is better but still not that great.  The SimpleBurner isn't too bad either -- it's just limited to copying your CDs.The Sony MD player is terrific at recording stuff off the radio for time-shifting. However, Sony won't let you transfer it back on to your computer for safe-keeping. The only way to do this is real time dubbing through your sound card. How FRUSTRATING! The MD could be one terrific tool for ripping your old LPs, or whatever, but Sony has made this impractical. This crippling of functions by Sony makes it useless for lots of people, I'm sure.The compression and audio quality are terrific and it sounds great to my ears, even at the highest compression rates.One terrific thing you can do with the MD is record off you favorite radio stations and then edit out the commercials and even move the songs around. This is so easy to do, that I do this while on my evening walks! You end up with a custom ""best of"" tape. But, then it's a pain-in-the-neck if you want to get that back on your computer.The price is a deal for such a great piece of hardware and the MD disks are cheap, sturdy and hold a lot. I take mine on trips all over the world and even 5 MDs is plenty.  I take my MD places that I would be nervous to take an IPod or some other higher-priced MP3 player. Also, battery life is great and it uses just normal AA's which you can buy anywhere -- a big advantage for travel.Even though it is marketed as ""speedy"" it doesn't seem that fast to me. I haven't' actually timed it, but I think you could burn an MP3 CD quite a bit faster.So, if you want to time-shift NPR or Rush, it's a great little machine. I havne't seen anything around that can beat it. But I wouldn't recommend it for listening to MP3s.If Sony had just written better software and hadn't crippled it, the MD player would be killer. But, it's good for some functions like time shifting."
1284,"I use this to charge batteries for my Canon S110. I feel this is one of the shortcuts Canon took on an otherwise awsome line of cameras. Yes, it works and I've never had any major problems with it, but its made of clunky plastic, is just about as big as the camera and just feels tacky. On the upside, the electrical plug folds into itself to provide ease of portability which is a very nice feature. Have not figured out why, but sometimes when its charging batteries it makes a humming noise. But its reliable. Mine is going on 2 years and still works fine."
1285,I had ordered 2 Hosa XLR TWIN XLR WITH COMPUTER JACKit fell off the order with no explinationIt is bad buisness not to say by the way we do not have these items so they will not be sent
1286,"I bought these from an affiliate seller as I live close to them here in NYC and I was able to save a few $$.  These are great headphones but if you are expecting to block out all other noise, forget it.  The way these are designed you are still able to hear what is going on around you which here in NYC is a good thing.  You still hear the music which comes through loud and clear.  I was hearing subtle notes and tones with these even through the surrounding street noise which I never did with my cheapo Colby headset which did a good job of blocking out noise when playing music.There is good tension on the metal headband but the way this is designed with foam rests make for a very comfortable fit.  I have worn these for a number of hours straight with glasses without any discomfort.This has a straight plug which I like as it does not interfere with the case for my iphone 3G.  When a call comes in I just unplug the headphone and move the speaker off of my ear.  I do not have to worry about breaking these as they are of a solid construction.  Even if they did break, Koss provides a LIFETIME warranty though the cost of shipping is about 25% of what I paid.  If these ever do break I may just buy a different pair but who knows.To sum up, these are probably the best bang for your buck for over the head phones.  They are not pretty though so if you are more concerned with looks than with good sound go buy something else."
1287,out of the box and you know what? wasn't working. i may reordering another one but for a first impression i can say i wasn't impressed.returned for a full refund.
1288,"The headphones were nice. The cord was longer than I needed, but not too bad. The sound in one of the headphones broke in a week. Amazon doesn't accept returns without the original packaging, which I didn't have. It shipped in one of those plastic containers that you have to use scissors to open. I contacted Sony which is what you have to do when their product has a defect like this. It cost an additional $6.00 to mail them the item to be repaired or replaced. The quality was nice and they were enjoyable to use. My problem is with the support that Sony gives you after it's broke."
1289,"I wasn't expecting much but these sound great!  I'm no audiophile but I am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock.  And feel really comfortable on my head.  Not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares.  I'm ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet.  They play pretty loud with just my Note 3 aux out, btw."
1290,"I bought a spindle of these in 2004 and had no real problems with them.  In December 2005 I bought a new 50-pack and noticed that the CDs smelled of solvent or plasticizer and had irregular, lumpy edges. I've had errors on each of the first five discs I have attempted to burn.  With my previous batch I had a very low error rate.  Unless Memorex raises their QC standards I would recommend trying your luck with a different manufacturer.  With an 0 for 5 record so far, I have to give this product one star."
1291,"I have owned theseSony SRS-A27 Desktop Personal Speakers with 2-Way Power Supplyfor quite some time now. I use them with mySony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave World Band Receiver with Single Side Band Receptionand, for listening to shortwave broadcasts and local AM stations in conjunction with this particular radio, they are good, certainly much better than the Sony radio's mediocre internal speaker. For listening to FM music, they are adequate, no more (there is no bass response whatsoever and trebles border on harsh).At their current price of $14.99 they appear to be priced fairly - but there is something to consider VERY carefully before purchasing them: Sony's AC adaptorSony ACE90HG AC Adaptoris currently being sold by one of Amazon's partners Wall Street Photo (also known as ""Your High-Priced Outlet"") for $69.00(!).Who in their right mind would pay $69.00 to power a set of $14.99 speakers?And to find a reasonably priced after-market adaptor is somewhat difficult as Sony uses non-standard plugs (I believe, however, that you can find a suitable adaptor at Radio Shack; at least you can try it out there to see if it works properly - and Radio Shack's price will almost certainly be better than that of Wall Street Photo whose prices, at least as they appear for several products here on Amazon, are nothing short of outrageous!).In addition, there is the cost of batteries. It is costly to run these speakers from standard alkaline batteries and the initial cost of good NiMH batteries and a charger (if you don't already have these items) would have to be added to the cost of the speakers.It's a pity that they cannot be directly powered from a computer via its USB port but I suppose that that is a minor point.For the purposes I personally use the speakers they are adequate. I would not recommend them for listening to music on CDs, MP3s, etc., but, for voice, they are fine.Though made in China, they appear to be very well-constructed, like almost all Sony products.Just keep in mind that, though they cost only $14.99, that's not the true overall price. Only you can determine whether the total cost for speakers as limited as these is worth it to you. At the time I purchased them, it was worth it to me but ""if I knew then what I know now"" I think I would have gone with something else."
1292,"Low price, free shipping from Hong Kong. It worked for few months and it is now dead. Tried to reset, re -seat, retried on different computer but is is still belly up.  What I could complain cheap thing from China anyway !!! Do not buy it."
1293,"Works as I expected. It was quite difficult to get on my Canon EF 10-22mm lens the first time.  I thought it wasn't going to fit, but then finally it lined up.  Once it was on it worked great!"
1294,"It is kind of flimsy, for the price is not a biggie but it does the job, so I probably recommend."
1295,"I purchased these headphones because I needed a cheap, silent alternative to my computer speakers.  These headphones looked like they had quality and they did sound alright.  My problem with these headphones is that after a few hours of gaming while wearing these, my ears would become extremely sore, almost as if I had hung a huge weight on my ears.  It kind of felt like someone was trying to tear my ears off after two hours or so.  When headphones become this uncomfortable, they become very noticeable.  When they get this noticeable, they are more of a pain than a joy to use, literaly.  The price for looking cool with these &quot;street style&quot; headphones is not only whatever you pay for them, but also excrutiating pain comming from the tops of your ears."
1296,"I have had good luck with off-brand camera batteries in the past so I was confident when I purchased this one as a second battery for my Canon G9.  Unfortunately, I have just returned it.  When placed in the charger, the charge light would illuminate but, instead of turning green when the charge is complete, the light would just go out.  When I tried the battery in the camera - nothing.  Would not power up at all.  The camera and charger work fine with my original battery, so it's definitely this off-brand battery that's the problem.  I won't order another Digital Concepts battery."
1297,"Heed the warning. If anyone gives more than three stars they must work for the company or something.  I won't argue the sound of this headset, it is nice. But I guarantee that with average use, they won't last more than a year, and with the price you pay, they should last much longer.  I was quite disappointed.  As the other ratings on the durability of this headset, they are terrible.  I wish I could get my money back.  I have tried many headsets in my life, and must say that the Bose AE have left me frustrated beyond belief. I'm a frequent traveler for the military, and depend on the comfort of music and my books on audio when I travel.  All four of my Bose headsets have defaulted on me.  This set in particular have cracked both times leaving me with a left and right headphone separated.  This is inexcusable.  Bose cannot say they are unaware of this issue because the complaints are widespread and found to anyone who wishes to search for a rating or review of all their AE (around ear 1 and 2) headsets.Again, heed the warning.  Try these [ASIN:B0042ETXRQ Denon AH-D1100 Advanced Over-Ear Headphones (Black)]] instead if you have the money to burn on a Bose AE headset."
1298,"This is a factory replacement battery for an APC UPS. It is a piece of cake to install and fits my unit perfectly. It is shipped in a very nice molded Styrofoam protected box to ship undamaged.Would a non-factory less-expensive equivalent done as well? Probably, but I did not want to take a chance because this was for my work. My hunch is that if you order an off-brand battery with the same electrical specs and same terminals and same or slightly smaller dimensions, you'll be fine.I have ordered generic replacement sealed lead-acid batteries before without any problems. The only negative I encountered with generics is that they were not packaged well and had little chips of plastic banged off some of the corners. Not enough damage to effect performance, but you might want to inquire about your vendor's shipping container."
1299,It's over priced piece of plastic and doesn't work. It doesn't come with instructions and i just doesn't work. I wish id read the negative reviews before i bought this
1300,"I bought these Sony MDR V150's about 4 months ago. They did not last long. The flimsy plastic fork-shaped connectors between the ear cups and the headbands snapped when I rested my head on one side. I bought the Sennheiser HD 202  as a replacement. The 202's are far better, and for a few dollars more a big improvement. I wish I'd bought the 202's in the first place. Please see my review of the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones for more information. I chose the Sony set because it seemed the least expensive headphone set. Spending less is only good if the product lasts long enough to receive value, these did not last.If you are still considering this set, remember the Sony MDR V150 are actually very small diameter cups supra-aural, not circumaural. These are important distinctions to know when purchasing headphones. Circumaural will fit completely over and around the ears, not contacting the outer-ear parts. The supra-aural models look very similar (especially in photos), but are smaller in diameter and will fit with the pad contacting the outer-ear parts (penna). That contact flattens the outer-ear against the skull, causing pressure. My motivation for moving to over-the-head sets from earbuds and plugs was to avoid irritation. Circumaural is the most comfortable choice for sensitive wearers.I gave these 2 stars because they are not useless. If you want an inexpensive set, they sound ok. If handled with care, they could work well enough. They are not uncomfortable, just found to be far less comfortable than the others, after comparison."
1301,"I had been looking for a good headset to use with my cordless phone at home. I have tried many headsets and none worked well enough for the people on the other end of the call to hear me. With this headset I can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly. The price was great as well, under $20."
1302,"I will echo vander-reviewers comments about this headset.  They don't cancel the roar of my Deere, but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while I mow.  It takes some adjustment to get it to fit comfortably over a ball cap and sunglasses, if not you'll notice some discomfort after an hour or so.  (Lucky vander-r, my lawn takes 4 hours on a good day.)"
1303,"I have been using Sony Cd-Rs for years now without any problems.  However, when I stumbled across some very bad reviews of Sony here on Amazon, I decided to give Memorex disks a try when I saw them on sale.Boy, I should have listened to myself when I said I was going to stick with Sony. Not one of the Memorex CD-Rs would burn (using my Dell PC). I went through about 5 in a row. Not one! The minute I popped in a Sony disk, it burned as smooth as butter, so I knew it couldn't be corrupted data as the problem; it had to be the Memorex disks.  I immediately dumped the brand new Memorex spindle with the remaining 45 blank CDs in the trash. $8 (at least it was a very good sale) wasted.  I didn't even bother testing the others.  I wouldn't buy a computer with the expectation that it will only work 95% of the time and I don't buy disks with the same expectation.  When I buy something new, I expect 100% of it to work 100% of the time.Perhaps it is true that some disks will not work on all machines.  Who knows.  All I know is Memorex doesn't work on mine but Sony has worked flawlessly on every computer and CD player I have ever used them on.  So that's it for me. I will never deviate from what I know to be true again. For all I know Memorex reps could be the ones writing those bad reviews of Sony. LOL!Sony has been infallible for me and with Sony I shall remain.  Memorex is in the trash right where it belongs."
1304,"They worked for me on my 18 channel mixing console,i connected my rca Y cable and it works just fine,i recommend these"
1305,"This solution did not work for me.  I employ a KVM switch to switch back and forth between my two computers and PS/2 connectors are required.  My ASUS P8Z77-V LE Plus motherboard has a combo PS/2 connector; but when I connected the keyboard and mouse via this splitter, they were not recognized.  Luckily this item was inexpensive, so I shelved it.  My solution was to install a SYBA SD-PCI-UPS2 USB to Dual PS2 Adapter (Case Mounted version) and connect the two PS/2 connectors from my KVM switch to it.  It turned out to be a cleaner connection in the back of my mid-tower anyway...it didn't protrude as far back and provided less clutter."
1306,"I bought a few, They didn't hold charge. Buy genuine batteries. Or risk getting a good one and a bad one."
1307,This is cheap and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  The button from the wrist strap is nice.  The alligator clip is easy to attach to the case.  Could be a little bit longer though.
1308,"These sound awesome, and I am not a DJ.  I was just looking for some old fashioned, ear thumping headphones.  I love the way that they fold up and I love the strength in the cord.  The only negative thing that I have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock out."
1309,"I was a little skeptical at first because these are cheap (paid about $40) and the design is a little different, but WOW. The sound is phenomenal... I make my friends that have the ""Beats"" and ""Soul"" studio headphones (who also paid $200-$400) listen and they are jealous of the huge sound! Unless you just want to blow your $$ on those to get a rapper's brand name, get these!Summary:PROS:-HUGE soundstage-- great bass, but not overpowering. Good clarity in mids and the highs can sparkle if you want them to, even with bass! Brings music to life--hear it like never before.-Interesting design, get lots of questions/compliments.-PRICE -- are you kidding me, $40 for this high quality? thanks Koss!-comes with decent case and headphones are collapsible to easily carry in a backpack or pocket even.CONS:-cord seems a little short, but not bad. about 4 feet. I'm used to longer cords on studio headphones.-keep in mind these are ""on ear"" therefore let outside noise in a little. Also keep in mind you can turn these up REALLY loud. lol.Highly recommend these little headphones. If you are in the market for anything under $400, get these!"
1310,"The company killed 1 sale with 2 duds (not 2 birds with 1 stone).I bought two of these. The first one I unwrapped didn't work out of the box. It was very glitchy and would cut out if I touched it wrong. The sound quality didn't exist, obviously.The second one was better....for 3 days, then it started doing the same thing. The company offered to replace, but wanted me to ship it and pay for shipping which would cost more than I payed for these. Some deal."
1311,"If you don't already have a decent set of small, demagnetized tools, this is a good starter set. Most of the tools are useful, with only a couple of 'throw away' items.  The only downside is that the wire cutting tool I think is supposed to be sort of a combo tool, which makes it difficult to use to cut a lot of things.  Don't waste a lot of time trying to use them, just grab your trusty wire snips from the garage and use that for things such as cable ties, etc."
1312,"After hearing great things about SMC's Barricade line, I decided to try one when it came time to upgrade from B protocol to the newer, faster G protocol wireless.  Perhaps a good decision to upgrade -- but this isn't the product to do it with.The first rough spot was just trying to set a new admin password for security purposes.  The web-based configuration system kept complaining that my current password was incorrect -- over and over and over.  But after rebooting the box, a login attempt required the use of the new password, so the complaint was bogus.After getting the thing configured, I arrived at the issue of where to put it.  The D-Link router/WAP it replaced has a provision for wall mounting, which is what I'd done.  The SMC has no provision for wall mounting, no bracket for vertical placement...  It can only sit on its bottom.  Minor for some, rather irritating here where horizontal surfaces are already at a premium.That issue aside, the performance of the product was abysmal at best.  At just a few yards away with only two walls in between, a wireless connection back to the device from any wireless card at my disposal (including one of SMC's own) failed completely -- even with a high-gain external antenna attached.  Totally unacceptable, but in-line with tests I read (after I purchased it, unfortunately).The compatibility and performance issues were enough for a swift return of the box.About the only thing I can say on the up side for this unit was about its firewall reporting.  The ability to have it send hacker alerts via e-mail was interesting, and did work perfectly.But a nice feature or two just did not make-up for the other issues here."
1313,"After much online research trying to find a remote to replace two others, I settled here. Perhaps my equipment is just too old but I could never get codes for my Samsung DVD/VCR combo to install, even from the audio file sent by One for All."
1314,"I have never had a huge problem burning music onto cd-r discs till I purchased these Memorex. I am an avid Amazon customer but I did not purchase these from them. I still felt I owed it to all buyers to warn them. Had I bought them from Amazon I would have been able to return them hassle free with the huge problems I encountered. Regretfully I purchased a 100 spindle of these Memorex cd-r discs somewhere else and 20 out of 25 have been unusable and turned into everready coasters. I have a great HP computer with a superb recording drive andd also use Roxio as my main recording source. Over the past 5 years I have used many different brands from name brands to store brands and honestly never had problems other than the rare and random fluke bad cd. But here whenever I go to record my own playlist the cds have a mind of their own and will burn some of the songs but not all. Like everyone else I thought it was me until I realized howe many hours and discs I had gone through. I tried burning through itunes as well as Roxio and I am not a novice. I do know what I am doing.So, does anyone out there want 50 coasters? I won't even attempt using these ridiculously subpar cd-r discs. And as one other reviewer said items such as this really are basically a 1 or 5 star product. If you purchase a 100 spindle pack and have 2-3 discs that may not work that is a 5 star product but if you use over 50 of them and 40 do not work as is my new score at the time of finalizing this review that is in no way anything above a 1 star product. Please be kind to yourself, avoid the hassle and purchase another brand. Last note, I found a cd-r review site that categorized excellent quality, medium quality and bad quality cd-rs and Memorex was on the bad list. And remember, Amazon sells the product but is not responsible for its subpar performance."
1315,Audio is crisp and clear and design is very comfortable. Even more comfortable when paired with the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions.
1316,"I gained absolutely no reception benefit in attaching this antenna to any of my systems. The first is a JVC receiver for living room, the other a Harmon/Kardon & Marantz in a home theater space.There was no discernable difference between this product and the otherwise useless wire antenna. I wanted better reception of a station located about 50 miles away, but even the stronger signal commercial stations failed to benefit.The design flaw is due to the unit's power wire emerging from the bottom of this antenna. This makes it impossible to set the antenna upright since the wire sticks out enough that it tilts over. They need either a taller base stand to accommodate for the wire, or design a space to tuck it in.While I'm sure many found this product beneficial, in my case it's 1.5 stars based on inconsistent function, exaggerated claims, and misfit design. Returned with pleasure."
1317,"Pros: It's cheap. I got 3 of them for about $10 dollars somewhere.Cons: A waste of my $10 dollars. Sound quality is fuzzy at best, even when it's sitting less than 5 feet away from the radio. Lot's of static if you even nudge the transmitter. Frequently *goes dead silent*; I have 3 units and they're all identical in this respect.I hate to say ""you get what you pay for"" because you don't even get that much with this thing.It is, however, a great gift to give to someone you don't like or want to irritate for a few hours. It's dead simple to set up and use, so when it doesn't work they'll start pulling out hair trying to figure out why until they realize that the unit just doesn't work as you'd think."
1318,"I bought this recently for my Nikon D3200 and it fits perfectly. It is very easy to screw on and off (haven't encountered having to use pliers to take it off like some reviewers).This is my first CPL filter i have owned, so I cannot compare it to more expensive filters. However, it is clear that a nicer CPL filter would exist in the world. I took some difficult photos of snowy mountains (Idaho sawtooths) yesterday and had a tough time aligning the dark polarizer onto the blue sky behind the mountains (see photo). However, when taking pictures of rivers/creeks the polarizer cuts through the whitewater and allows you to see the river rocks (see my before/after photos). Also, the green foliage beside the river 'pops' with the filter. Unfortunately, at time, the polarizer gives the photos an artificial look (as opposed to a more natural look). Like it's been touched up.It is a great filter, i love it. But definitely amateur quality (perfect for my needs), if you want to take professional-quality photos then you will need something nicer."
1319,"I bought this cable on sale, and it worked fine.  No better or worse than any other optical audio cable.  The main problem I have with this cable is that it broke when I removed it from the back of my DVR.  Around the pin on each of the cable's end there is a small, rectangular piece of plastic, a sort of a shield that guides and holds the end of the cable in place.  On my Monster cable, this plastic piece came off, under normal use, rendering the cable useless as the cable will not set in place without it.  Bottom line, avoid Monster and the overblown hype and just buy a cheap cable instead.  It will work just as well, if not better."
1320,"It's must for anyone serious about outdoor and landscape photography.  It's a great product. One criticism I have is about the container, which can be smaller, therefore not taking up too much space in your bag. I replaced the container with an old much more compact one."
1321,"My father got me started with Tiffen filters many years ago, and I've never had any reason to change. This is exactly what I expected and performs perfectly. Unless you are a serious pro, and know that you have specific needs that require something else, I'd recommend this to anyone."
1322,"I gave this S2 to my mom for Mother's Day. After a few weeks, the very fine speaker wire that runs inside of the headband somehow became unsecured and exposed. It was then accidentally pulled as my mother removed it one day and the fine wire tore, rendering the unit unplayable.It has been almost impossible contacting Sony for repair. When I finally reached them, the repair costs for this small repair were unwarranted and I ended up purchasing a new unit at a discount outlet. Sony is engineering is good but their service is terrible. This is not a good prospect for a consumer in the long run."
1323,"Overall, I love it.Pros: - good pictures quality - Bright LCD - Easy to use, easy to understand controls.  On the other hand, I  alway have to refer to the user manual for my Canon A50.Cons: - The flash is too bright for show distance shots. - No lens cover - No self-timer"
1324,"I bought a pair for record monitoring about 20 years ago and liked them so much I bought a second set before they were discontinued.  The retailer I got them from is long gone but these babies are still available.  Not that I need them, they still function perfectly.  I keep one on the computer and one on the stereo.  They are not the best sounding cans I've heard as I own a set of Stax.  BUT they are the best monitors I've ever used.  A little hot/harsh above 10KHz but that's what you need to hear what you've got.  They can smell any clipping.  The Stax earpads have gotten flaky but these Sony's have aged well.  They get dropped, ripped off my head etc. all the time, no problem.  They fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything.  I wear them for hours comfortably.  I have other Sonys, Sennheisers, Beyers and others that I can't listen to anymore because of these.  There is no better value that I know of."
1325,"i bought these a the px 100's and girlfriend pick the px 100's i got these, i like the style and the sound is a huge step up from the ipod in ear phones. i also dig the warranty that koss gives these. i have to admit the sound is a little more defined on the sennhiesers(how do you spell it?) but the difference is not worth quibbling over. you will be happy with either pair, but the px 100s stay in place on her head better (ive got a bigger dome) so if you have a small head go for those."
1326,"Sound is. Great.Price is great.A little fragile, but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound."
1327,"Radio shipped was labeled a 230V model, and the enclosed North American power cable would not fit. It was literally a square peg in a round hole. The first tech suggested carving the cable to make it fit and see what happens, the second one suggested just using batteries. Back it went, and I'll be looking for another brand."
1328,"Worked just fine until almost exactly one year after I got it, then it just died for no apparent reason.  Tried reinstalling drivers, and on different PCs, but it's dead."
1329,"I bought these to replace the earbuds that came with my iPod. The sound quality was rather poor. I ended up buying Koss PortaSound 2's instead which sound much better. I'm still looking for the good sound quality, comfortable, yet somewhat affordable earphones that are better for excercising, etc."
1330,"WTF! The sound quality is SO cheap! There's almost no distortion, but also no bass, or treble. No wonder why it cost me $20. My Shure earphones sounded like claws on blackboard. The only thing good about this is that I can control Musicmatch with the remote. If this thing is so call ""crystal clear digital"", then apparently it's not sending enough digits. And did I mention that I tested the receiver and transmitter only a foot apart. Unless you own some sort of give-away stereo, or need another way to scream across the room, this transmitter is unworthy of a hookup.BTW, it sounds just as crappy with Musicmatch. The transmitter basically acts as a soundcard via USB and of course transmission via RF.If you want to get an idea of how this thing sounds like: take a normal mp3 file, and compress it to the lowest bit-rate, or turn on your radio, oh sorry, radio sounds far more superior."
1331,"I gought this cable to connect my computer to my tv. It is been working fine. I was expecting it to be black but it came out grey, not a big deal but now stands out from the other cables that I have plugged into the tv."
1332,"As the price would suggest, this mouse in nothing special.  It gets the job done, but that's about all you can say for it.  Of course, we're talking about a mouse here, so it doesn't really need to do anything special except point where you direct it to.I found one annoying design element, this mouse has extremely loose action on the scroll wheel.  If you like some feedback from your mouse scroll wheel, stay away from this model."
1333,"The package that I bought from Amazon included the AverMedia EZMaker DVD PCI card and a CD with the driver and the capture/editing application, called ""neoDVDstandard version 4, 5, 1, 518 L000015"" (I've never seen such a long version number).The PCI card lacks component video inputs, but is otherwise quite satisfactory. I'd rate it at 9/10.The software package, however, was quite a disappointment. I would rate it at 1.5/10, in part because of the following specific problems:1. There seems to be a huge difference between the ""better"" (middle-quality) and ""best"" (highest-quality) recording modes, both in terms of quality and file size. The ""best"" mode produces enormous files (more than 3 GBytes per hour of video). The ""better"" mode produces much smaller files, but at much lower quality. There really should be an intermediate quality level between these two modes.2. One can set the path to the Output File as many times as one likes, but the program does not remember this setting, i.e., one must specify it again every time the program runs. There should be an option that allows one to permanently set this output path.3. Regardless of what one specifies for the total capture time, the time shown under ""Maximum Capture Time"" doesn't change. This is confusing.4. When one is recording, there is no indication of elapsed time.5. It would be really handy if the documentation gave some guidelines for the relationship between file Video Quality setting and the size of the output file. For each Video Quality setting, there should be some simple relationship between the number of minutes of video and the typical output file size.6. When I click on the Tutorial button, it brings up my browser (Netscape Navigator 7.2) and I see a replica of the launcher interface with the text ""Click on any module to begin"". If I click on the Capture button, I then get a screen with 10 numbers in red circles. It looks as though clicking on these buttons is supposed to provide more information, but nothing happens when I click on them.7. After editing an MPEG file to trim out just the part that I wanted, I wanted to save the edited file to disk as another MPEG file, but it appears that there is no way to do this.8. During editing, it should be possible to speed up and slow down the playback. Without the ability to speed up the playback, it takes too long to find the chapter boundaries. Without the ability to slow down the playback (to less than real-time speed), one cannot accurately set the chapter markers."
1334,"These are great earbuds, with some small caveats:If you have small ears they will be uncomfortable. I have larger ears and I have to fuss with them to get the position just right.The little foam covers on the buds seem delicate and have fallen off a few times.The cord is short (maybe 3 ft) which is fine for a portable player, but is awkward for using with many computers or other non handheld components. I just got a miniplug extension cord at radioshack to fix that, and it is great.On the plus side:The sound is very clean and natural sounding with no excess bass or treble.I did not realize it for over a month, but there is a tiny linear volume control on the cord, which is very nice.This are the most recommended cheaper earbuds ( I did a lot of review searching), and I wholeheartedly agree."
1335,"i have an ipod video, 30g, and these do not work with it. only the really old models have that extra little port near the headphone jack and without it the remote is useless. the only bonus is that i got another pair of apple headphones for about eight bucks. i bought these to use with a wired backpack and since they dont do what they say im still on the market."
1336,MOUSE SIDE WAS OK. KEYBOARD SIDE DID NOT WORK AND COMPUTER FIGURED THIS OUT DURING THE POST PROCESS(POWER ON SELF TEST).  A CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK. TRY THE BELKIN VERSION. WORKED PERFECTLY.
1337,"The surge protector is Ok. My complaint is that you have to be Superman to plug your device into the outlet. I am a big guy, but with this protector I feel like Olive Oyl."
1338,"Got a pack of 50 of these to burn playlists for X-Mas gifts thinking Sony would be better than the Staples or Memorex brands, which I did not recognize. WOW, did I ever go wrong. These made a racket in my CD burner before ejecting. Eventually, some worked, most didn't.Returning these tomorrow."
1339,I've had two pair of these.  Lost the first pair and replaced them.  Light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty.  You just can't go wrong.
1340,"These were terrific - great sound, comfy - but they BROKE!!  Gently used, just snapped off, unusable.  SNAPPED OFF!  Weird.  All the ear buds and headsets that have come and gone, this has never happened."
1341,"This remote is mostly for outdoor use - very good to navigate the iPod while it is tucked inside your pocket, mostly with the keypad put on hold.  Would have been great if the remote was wireless.  It is not very useful indoors since you have to get near the iPod to operate the remote - you might as well put your fingers on the iPod itself.This used to come free with the 3G iPods, along with the leather case (that's how I got it!).  I hardly use it since I have a wireless remote (NaviPod).Looks like it has been designed to work well with the Apple iPod carrying case.  This is because, with the Apple case, there is no way to access the iPod controls when the iPods is inside the case.  This remote has all the controls (except that we can't see the display), and a hold button on the side.  It also has a simple clip to fasten it to your clothes.If your habit is to put a long playlist and play it while jogging, working out etc., this remote could be useful."
1342,Neck strap broke at seam about the forth time I used it.  Binoculars are OK.  The price was low also.
1343,"These headphones are amazing. The sound quality is great. Neutral to some extent. The bass is true, the mid-range is strong, and the treble is clear. The supplied 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater set-up. These headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the sound.The stock earpads are okay. I bought the Beyerdynamic Pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones. Plus, they add a bit more bass, which is great.These cans have the reputation of being extremely tough. I can't really say much about that, since I've owned them for a couple of months barely. But I'm hoping to get some years from these."
1344,"I bought these headphones as a replacement for a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s that broke.  I found them to be an uncomfortably tight fit on my thoroughly average-sized cranium.  Worse, the sound is quite muddy and indistinct.  These headphones aren't unusable, but I wish I'd just coughed up the extra $5 for the MDR-XD200s."
1345,"This unit, like much Philips gear, uses a remote protocol that is impossible for most &quot;learning&quot; or even programmable remote controls to emulate.  (This maybe purposeful on Philips' part as they try to promote their own Pronto brand of home-theater remotes.)Even though the picture quality was pretty good with this unit, I ultimately returned it because of the remote incompatibility.  To be honest, it didn't really even respond to its own remote control very reliably;  Philips' way of multiplexing the functionality of the VCR and DVD on the same remote was quite clumsy.  It responds slowly, and you never quite know what &quot;mode&quot; it's in, partly because of the few front-panel indicators, and partly because of the poor on-screen status displays.Another downside was that, on the VCR side, this unit is incapable of setting its own clock based on the time signal sent out by many PBS stations;  in this day and age ALL VCRs should have this &quot;autochron&quot; feature instead of forcing you to watch a blinking 12:00 after a power outage."
1346,"The sound from these buds is wonderful, and they fit great.but, the con is after about a month or less,the covering over the wires deteriorates leaving the wires exposed.I have owned two sets and it's happened both times.So basically they are a waste of money due to that fact."
1347,I'm no audiophile but these are noticeably awesome. Fantastic audio quality all around at a very fair price. Highly recommended.
1348,"Picked up one of these and set it on a card table to play a 12 year old game (Age of Empires II) with some friends from college. The switch was disconnected from the modem.Ping times were between 0 and 1 ms, which was excellent. Everything went smoothly for about 2 hours. After that point, the link lights on individual ports just died suddenly. New cables, new laptops (one literally out of the box yesterday morning), everything pointed to the switch.This switch simply cannot handle moderate-to-heavy packet flow. After repeated crashing, the switch worked after power cycling for 30 seconds. All indications are that this product is okay for very light use. The three of us needed it to do one job and one job only. Bottom line is that it failed to perform."
1349,"These are quality headphones. I use them around the house. They look funny with the knobs on top sticking out, but I don't care about looks. If I did I would have shelled out an extra 200 for some beats. Alas, if you want sound quality similar to Dr. Dre Beats without the ""cool"" look go for these!"
1350,"I've tested the TU-PS2 with a Dell Vostro 200 and can confirm that it *doesn't* work, despite of what a previous reviewer found. If you plug the TU-PS2 into a Dell Vostro 200 and connect a PS2 keyboard, every keystroke gets multiplied 5 times, there's clearly something wrong with this converter.I've also tested the TU-PS2 (independently of the test above) with a KVM switch, an IOGEAR KVM2Kit, in which case it doesn't even work with a plain vanilla HP laptop with Windows XP installed.Conclusion: The TRENDnet TU-PS2 works with less hardware than a cheap noname $5 USB/PS2 converter you can order from various places. Definitely not worth to pay $15."
1351,"Here's the problem with these &quot;mini&quot; CD players: they use a fullsize CD mechanism! No manufacturer has had the guts to build a dedicated mini-CD reader mechanism, so all the so-called mini-CD products just try to pack the guts of a full size CD reader into a smaller package. The result is something that's only 1-2 cm smaller (in linear dimension) than its full sized brethren. Not too compelling!Having said that, the unit is not bad; it's just not small. There are occasional quirks in the audio between songs (as others have reported) and the unit seems slightly more prone to skipping than other CD players I've used. Continous jostling movement (e.g. jogging) will result in occasional skipping.(Note: I recently downgraded my review as the display stopped working a few months after purchase. When it works, the unit is pretty good, but it's kind of hard to use with the display out!)"
1352,Garbage!! not much else to say. Horrible sound quality. I would feel bad asking my neighbors kid to listen to them.
1353,"I've had this for a little over 3 years. The first few months when I first purchased the printer it worked fine. I had a Canon printer prior this and I was looking for a printer that will save me money on ink, unlike the HP printers I've owned. I was proven wrong. This doesn't save me anything. The printer head stopped working and I had to replace it. Took me awhile to figure that out, I've bought inks after ink and it won't print anything, it would always come out blurred out and as if it ran out of ink when I just literally installed a new one. You'd have to replace the printer head for it to work again. Found and bought one on eBay for $30. Ink isn't cheap and it doesn't last very long. When it's working, it works ok but you'd be better off investing your money on something else that won't waste your money on ink and all the trouble of replacing the print head."
1354,"Es un buen producto aunque podria mejorar en la calidad de los materiales, cumple con lo necesario de uso aunque con el tiempo el plastico junto a los conectores comienza a presentar desgaste"
1355,"The unit is well made.  The hard drive idea is great!!  It only works with DVD-R disks and DVD RAM disks which kind of stinks, but hey, I can live with that.  So how did Panasonic screw this one up to make it essentially worthless to me?  Well, read on...The primary reason I bought this, and missed this nuance in the reviews/descriptions was that I wanted to time shift rented DVDs.  I thought I would be able to back up a limited number of DVDs to the hard drive, watch them, and then delete them later to record another movie etc.  I didn't want to buy a DVD burner and have tons of DVD media hanging around, and the integrated hard drive seemed like just the ticket.Panasonic, in all their brilliance, blocked it.  You cannot copy a DVD, copy protected or not, to the hard drive unless it is a DVD-RAM disk.  I can understand not allowing someone to copy protected material to another DVD, but to block it from copying to the hard drive makes the unit a dust collector.  I went out and bought a DVD burner and use DVD+/-RW for time shifting my viewing now.Another negative is that Panasonic made it so the thing won't even play any DVD with a + in it.  DVD +R or DVD +R/W, both of which work dandy on my other DVD player and in my comupter.  So I have to have a separate DVD player to read DVD +Rs I burn with my DVD Burner.  Lamo.  I can't even use the thing as an expensive DVD player.This unit is just plain not worth the money unless you have a ton of VHS or taped material you want to move to DVD or if you are into video recording and want to copy that material to DVD.  That it does well.  You can also record unprotected DVD material through the analog inputs and edit it.  And finally, you can use it to record TV shows to the hard drive or DVD, but I already had Replay TV which does a much better job of that.So, the lack of being able to send a DVD movie to the Hard Drive drops this puppy to 2 stars."
1356,Items are allot bigger then they appear making monitor adapting very hard. ended having to buy and extension cable to use these.
1357,"This took kit is not bad.  It has a lot of things that I did not have, all in a handy case that is attractive and will be able to easily accommodate replacement tools as the originals wear out.  I have to agree with many people about the flashlight.  It is a piece of junk.  It does not even have an on-off switch.  You have to unscrew the light bulb holder part to turn it on and off, and if you don't unscrew it enough, I guarantee that your batteries will run down very fast. If you are a professional, you will probably feel like this is junk, but if you are just wanting to fix your own laptop, this will give you the tools that you need."
1358,Simple and cheap. Improves my daylight landscapes remarkably well. Dual purpose protects my lens also. Another necessity for any serious photographer.
1359,"Traditional hard disks have 3 screw holes on each side. Many (esp Dell and HP) hard drive 'holders' now only use the front and back and not the middle ones. But this device is only long enough to have holes at the front and middle positions.The point being that if you wanted to put a 2.5"" drive in this and use it in many holders you'd only have connections at the front."
1360,"The Canon ef 100mm f/2.8 is a perfect lens for a narrow band of applications. For portaits and life size (full picture of a small object) it serves very well. However, I found it difficult to give up the flexibility of my 17-85mm zoom lens. I don't carry a pack of lenses around so the versatility of the 17-85mm trumps most other characteristics most of the time.Don't get me wrong, the 100mm is of excellent quality, with no problems. It is capable of very sharp photos and is fun to use. Some people say it's too heavy. I don't think so. Its weight and size don't bother me at all (I use it on my 350xt). I've gotten some very sharp and interesting pictures using it. However, wide angle capability and being able to compose pictures by including or excluding elements of the scene has spoiled me. (I would have liked a little more zoom on the 17-85mm though.)The net result is that I occasionally use this macro, and very much enjoy it when I do. I'm happy with it and recommend it for portraits and closeups, and even as a walk around lens provided you can compose the picture by walking where you need to be."
1361,"This extension cable caused a buzzing noise through the stereo. Something is wrong with the female end and if anything bumps, moves, or touches it even slightly, there is a loud buzzing noise. I replaced this with a cheap cable from Best Buy and it works fine so I know it had nothing to do with my setup. Definitely not worth the money."
1362,Not much to say other than it works as advertised. No kinks. Doesn't seem to affect sound quality. I can wheel around my cube at work as needed.
1363,"I bought this adapter to use an old Canon BJC80 printer with my old Mac Powerbook and a newer Dell Mini.It is not a transparent printing solution by far.On my Mac, I have to disconnect the adapter and reconnect the adapter to the USB port between each print job as it will not initialize the printer.On my Mini, I have just given up as I cant seem to get it to print at all.  Windows says the device is ready, and recognizes my printer, but all my jobs error out and sit in their queue.i'd return it, but it would cost more to ship back than its worth."
1364,I can't really rate this. I ordered it in error where as i should have ordered a VGA to HDMI-D cable. Although the delivery was great.
1365,"Koss does it again- I'll never purchase another brand's headphones, ever.  My last 5 have all been Koss and these have held up great.  I also got a set of PortaPros for casual wear.  Love Koss!"
1366,"After trying dozens of headsets for my phone I was a little hesitant to try another one, but I've heard good things about the Plantronics brand so I thought I'd give this a try. Most of the headsets I've used suffered from poor reception or poor design (or both). I was both pleased and surprised that the M175C excels in looks and function. Calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind. The headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear. It comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head, which I did. The volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel. This works remarkably well and I find myself using it more than the volume control switch that's on my phone. Because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours I can hardly tell I have it on. It's so nice to finally be able to move around, make a cup of coffee, wave my hands in the air, or whatever.I highly recommend the M175C to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phone."
1367,"This camera has all of the adjustments a person could want. It's very similar to my older SLR cameras that use film, only much less expensive to operate since the images are electronic.  There are several automatic settings, or the aperature can be set manually while leaving the speed automatic.  The speed can be set while leaving the aperature on automatic, or bot can be set manually. There are several levels of picture quality.  You can have lots of pixels for high quality, but fewer pics on the memory card, or choose lower quality and more pics, or somewhere in-between.  Lots of flexibility.  Cons:  The camera had a defect that causes it not to be able to connect to a computer.  I had to buy a card reader separately, which is a hassle, but it works (requites removing the memory card from the camera and connecting the reader to the computer).  The battery is a special unit and doesn't last long, but is ok for my needs.  The memory cards are of an older design and don't have anywhere the capacity of the cards the newer cameras use.  The bottom line:  I got a very flexible camera for far less that the price of a new electronic SLR.  The picture quality and flexibility are excellent.  The seller could have been more open about its up-loading problem."
1368,Use this to connect from my wall to my router.  The long cord is very convenient and I have not found any degradation in speed.  Would recommend.
1369,"Just like the title of my review says, I've had these since 2009 and haven't had a single issue with them. Sony knew they hit the ball out the park with this model and have kept them in stock. What you get is a high quality set of head phones with a very durable coiled cord and a very convenient bag that has come with me to trips around Europe and back. While they're not the best for noise canceling for when flying (not really intended to) they do make up with great sound, a punchy bass, balanced mids and highs and all without the need for an amp, but don't get me wrong, using an amp is also a great option. The specs are:Impedance : 63 ohmsDriver Unit : 40mmSensitivity (db) : 106dB/mWFrequency Response : 5Hz - 30,000HzHope this helps."
1370,"Love the filter, great for using on my work laptop in open spaces. However the prices for these things are outrageous. I mean $35 for a thin piece of plastic and a few 1/4&#34; plastic holders?So the filter gets 5 stars, the price gets 0 stars."
1371,"Despite the description, this is NOT a touch lamp.  There is a switch and it offers only one level of brightness."
1372,"I've been a fan of Kensington trackballs for well over ten years. They've always been miles above all the others.But the construction of this one has driven me away. Most of it is the usual Kensington quality. The scroll ring is a great concept -- it's well placed and solves the problem of where to put the scroll wheel on a trackball.But like others, I've found that the scroll wheel bearings seem to be made of gravel. The first one I bought, I actually returned to the retail store as defective because of the horrible scratching sound and feel when I turned the scroll wheel. The replacement was just as bad. I called Kensington, who said it should smooth out with use. It didn't. I called again and they sent me a replacement. Same problem. That was two years ago and it's just as rough as on day one. (I moved it to a computer that I don't use much.) I finally gave up, since Kensington apparently no longer cared that the product I bought from them didn't work. Ten years ago they seemed to care.I guess that Kensington hasn't heard of ball bearings. Strange situation for a trackball. Honestly, though the scroll ring feels like it's running on gravel, my guess is that it just doesn't have bearings at all.This is totally inexcusable for a $100 product, and really brings Kensington's reputation into question. It's a great trackball if you don't use a scroll wheel/ring, but most people do, and for the price you should be able to use itThe only other currently made trackball that I consider usable is the Logitech Cordless Trackman -- the one with the trackball in the right place, not the older corded one with the absurd thumb-operated trackball. But I don't want wireless, and so I'm reluctantly going back to a regular mouse. And ironically, it will probably be a Kensington model.Edward-- I see the brevity of truth. --"
1373,"After exchanging emails with IOGear for days support, it finally dawned on them that this KMV switch does not work with Windows 7."
1374,"I bought these for a trifecta purpose.1)  I can use them while recording music.2)  I can have over-the-ear cans to listen to my mp3's3)  So I can enjoy music again.I'm not single anymore (haven't been for a LONG time), and I don't have the set-up that I used to have in order to listen to music at the volume I enjoyed.  Nor do I drive my car often enough to be able to listen to much more than a few tracks at a time.  Then my wife complains if I turn my music up past 3 on the volume knob.  So I pretty much fell out of the music listening loop over the years.  Music was, and has been a huge part of my life, and I miss it.  Now, with these cans, I can lock myself in the basement, sit back, and be that dude on the old Memorex packaging being blown away in his chair.  These things make music sound SO much better than it does coming through any loudspeaker.  It's like you're right there with it.  These aren't even on the same playing field as earbuds, and those expensive Dre Beats headphones suck compared to these.  After comparing the two, I'm SO glad I didn't waste my money on Beats.  I will likely buy a few more pairs of these so I don't have to keep transferring them from one device to the next.  And I took the advice of other reviewers and picked up theBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)to replace the ones that came on it.  They are much more comfortable and don't cause your ears to sweat nearly as bad as the ones that come on it.If you are a true music aficionado, you will not regret this purchase."
1375,"The tools seem sturdy. Its a good basic kit with some extras. I read the tools will rust if given the opportunity so keep them inside with the electronics. If you're curious yes; the folder is made of plastic, and the pliers have a spring."
1376,Like most of the other folks i too got the stuff half broken. Most of the plastic pieces on the top hood and on the legs were bad broken. I returned the stuff back immediately and asked for refund.I would suggest that you go to Fry's or something and get one there for 10 more bucks may be.
1377,Purchased the Monster Cable SS-6 Speaker Switcher to turn off and on my different speakers.  It does a good job and allows you to turn speakers off in one area of the home and on in another.  If you have thicker gauge speaker wire you will need some type of adapter on the ends of the wire.  There are simple spring clips on the back of the unit that can accommodate normal speaker wire.  The unit is not powered so don't expect it to provide a boost to your speakers.  It is a good basic speaker switcher.
1378,"No question this product is full on, 5 star material.  I received a pair of these phones in 1991 (maybe 1990, not sure), as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle.  Since receiving them, I have taken them with me all over the world.  I've slept with them on my head on 15 hour flights, I have slept with them in my bed, they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage.Not only do these things sound incredible, they obviously hold up VERY well considering the abuse I have heaped upon mine and they are STILL working and sounding perfectly after these EIGHTEEN (18) years.  I am in awe of their...awesomeness.I have replaced the ear pads once, with these Beyer Dynamic velour pads (highly recommended btw):  [...]I'm 36 years old, and wondering if I will be willing these things to one of my children?!  :)"
1379,"Love it great for the screen.  Use it on TV, phone, pads and computer.  Does a great job.  It's really great."
1380,"I bought a set of these to replace my original iPod earphones when they started malfunctioning. On the good side, the sound is decent. On the bad side, these earbuds are very uncomfortable. After more than a week of usage, I still can't find a positioning that will let me wear them for more than an hour without getting seriously annoyed. Also the cord is both short and not as convenient as iPod cords when it comes to folding/unfolding, tangling/untangling.I wish there was a way of testing earbuds before buying them. All I can say is, look at how many people writing these reviews are complaining about the ear fitting issues, and decide for yourself. I did this and bet that I wouldn't have problems, but obviously I lost. Clearly, I'm recommending that you pass, even though the offer is tempting."
1381,"I got the 935 at Staples, who claimed that it came withrechargable batteries. It didn't. They were 1.5v lithiums,not rechargeable.It's a nice camera, but 2 1800 mah cells last about 20minutes, no matter what you do. These are good cells, butthis thing eats electricity like General Motors.Hard to believe that HP would produce such a thing. I'msticking with my 1-2 megapixels cameras.Then again, it might be defective. Of course, for $50, you can buy an AC pack that you can take with you on a long expeditionin the veldt, with a long extension cord.Good lord, how could a company drop the ball so wonderfully????And Hewlett Packard.Jerry O'Dell"
1382,"$20 headphones, and they work great. I honestly believe that this is the best of what I can buy with the money. I like how durable it is."
1383,"I don't know how I can give a simple cable a one rating, but this has not performed. I tried to use it for a shotgun mic extension for my video camera. I kept getting a noticeable background hum. I have several other extension cables of different lengths. None of the other cables have this issue. It was only this one. I would like to think it was just one bad apple."
1384,"I sent it back because I ended up getting a strong access point to replace it. Still, it did what I needed."
1385,"When I was 15 (35 years ago), I was hired by my next door neighbour to stain her garage.  With my profits, I went headphone shopping.  For around 60 to 70 bucks Canadian, I splurged on a pair of Koss Pro-4AA headphones.  Wow!  Great bass, terrific highs, fine midrange.  I was in love with the sounds enveloping my head.  At that time, there was no better headphone in its price range.  I still remember when I was 17 and in my first semester of university and was listening to the first album by Deep Purple with the phones on while reading Jane Austin's Emma sprawled out on the chesterfield.  Them was the days.A lot has happened since then.  I not only finished reading Jane Austin's Emma, but I actually finished college a few times, got a job, and along the way purchased some other cans: Sennheiser 595, Grado SR-60, and a pair of AKG 271S.  I have an Ipod clone and a Total Bithead headphone amp.  I use my cans on my regular stereo kit with an Adcom 565 preamp headphone outlet.  Each headphone has its virtues and warts.  I enjoy them all, but usually listen to the AKG 271S (I listen to a lot of jazz, folk, world music, but also other genres as I teach courses like the sociology of music and popular culture for a living).Re-evaluating my Koss Pro-4AAs, I'm surprised at how good they sound for a pair of 35 year old headphones!  They are still involving, good overall sound, with excellent sound isolation and a snug, vise-like fit.  If the darn things weren't so robust (read: a pain in the neck after a while as they are rather heavy) and so tight, I'd probably use them more often.  I've been spoiled by the competition (and with the exception of the Grado SR-60s, paid substantially more for the other cans).The sound of the Pro-4AA's is pretty well balanced--some over emphasis of bass, but that isn't displeasing and is oftentimes welcome (it isn't super accurate like the AKG 271S phones which excell in monitoring music, studio use, and mixing).  The bass does get a bit muddy and the overall sound presentation isn't as smooth as the AKG 271S and the Sennheiser 595.  The midrange of the AKG 271S is hard to beat.  The midrange on the Pro-4AA's holds its own, but is not as smooth and detailed at the AKG.  In some ways, the Pro-4AAs are more ""musical"" than the AKG 271S.  The Pro-4AAs are fun to listen to and are very good.  The AKG 271S is much more accuate and for me, a better phone for critical listening when I really want to dissect a song.  In a sense, the Pro-4AA's are like good home stereo speakers; the AKG 271 sounds like studio monitor speakers.  Both have their place in the world, but if it's a party, go with the Koss Pro-4AAs.  If you are into analysis or studio work, go with the AKG 271S.I still like the Pro-4AAs and listen to them every now and then.  If you want sealed cans and are on a budget, you'd get an excellent bang for your buck with these headphones.  If you don't mind leaking sound, the on the ear, Grado SR-60s are a delight.  If you have the lolly and really want an accurate pair of sealed headphones, the AKG 271S is well worth it (don't bother with the MkII version as it really isn't all that different than the original version and is much more expensive).  If you just want a pair of musical and involving headphones and want comfort, go with the Sennheiser 595s.  Still, for a lot less, you can get the Pro-4AAs and if you are a casual listener the weight and the vise-like grip shouldn't be a detriment.35 years later, the Koss Pro-4AAs are still viable and a very good pair of cans that can still kick the jams."
1386,"I cannot say I like thi Cable, because I never received it - I tried another type from a different company which turned out to be an extension so I'm beginning to wonder as that is also lost but I did try THAT one. If Amazon has it here for me to review I suppose I should have it. I don't recall ordering one with 6 feet of cable, however."
1387,"Background History:I've been a devoted Kensington user for over 10 years, because they've always created great trackballs which are durable and have great features.  The Expert Mouse trackball line has always been priced high compare to competitors, but in the past, this price was well worth it.That no longer holds true.  Although the quality of the hardware still remains high, the software and product support  are poor in comparison.When a new Windows Operating system is introduced, Kensington doesn't maintain drivers to support the new OS for their older models.I purchased a $100 Expert Mouse Pro Trackball (64213) 7 years ago, and Kensington doesn't have any drivers for Vista, Windows 2008, or Windows 7 for this Model.I have a 7 year old cheaper Logitech trackball with multiple programmable buttons, and Logitech is still providing drivers for this mouse on newer operating systems.Review specifically on Kensington Expert Mouse 64325 Trackball:I decided to buy a new Kensington Expert Mouse, because my old Kensington 64213 trackball programmable buttons were no longer able to work on any of the new operating systems.I installed the software, and programmed the 3rd and 4th mouse buttons to do copy and paste.  When I went to try this out via Remote Desktop, the Kensington software failed to send the copy and paste command, and instead sent v and c characters.This feature works with my Logitech trackball, so I know it's not a problem with the Remote Desktop software, and instead it's a problem with the Kensington software.I called Kensington product support, and the poor English speaking support person tried to tell me that the buttons could not be programmed.  She obviously did not know the product.I asked for her supervisor, and he told me that they did not support using their mouse with remote desktop, and he suggested I should take the product back.I advice him that this was a bug in their software, and ask if there was any way I could find out if there was an upcoming fix for it.He stated there was no plans to fix it.I followed the Kensington support advise, and took the product back.It's a shame that Kensington doesn't understand that the hardware is only as good as the software that supports it.I recommend that any user looking to purchase a trackball, go with Logitech instead.Logitech software works with current OS, and Logitech continues to create new drivers for new operating systems, which allows old Logitech trackball models to continue working on new operating systems.I will never purchase another Kensington product."
1388,"I've had these headphones for at least 8 years. They've been stepped on constantly, thrown around, used for countless gaming/music listening hours, and even had my dog chew on them for a bit. They still work fine.Great sound quality, reliable, durable, and so comfortable you don't know they're on sometimes. 5 stars."
1389,"Based on all the recommendations on Amazon and around the Internet, this was the best model at my target price. The product actually exceeded my expectations. The sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable. As expected, Sony has not had to update this model for years because you can't improve upon perfection at this price point."
1390,"I bought these headphones for cheap. I got them shipped for 3-5 day shipping. I got them in 2 DAYS!!! And they were worth every penny! These R-10's are amazing.This is what I wanted for a pair of headphones:-Good bass-Comfortable fit-Not bulky (I hate headphones that pop out of my ears 4 inches)-Cheap but awesome.The R-10's fulfilled all of these. The only complaint I have is They're sound is a little muffled... But don't let that intimidate you! You get used to the sound quality in 2 hours of use. They are excellent and look very nice around your neck. Also a little tip! Wear them around your neck and turn up your audio. There! You can even use the headphones when they are not on your head! These are a wonderful buy on every level. And I should know, I am a music producer."
1391,"I have been using SportaPros for over 10 years.  I have gone through 4 pairs (I'm pretty rough on them.)  The sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great (and tight) for when you're training/working out/etc.  Also, you don't look like one of these fools with huge DJ headphones on their heads."
1392,Bought this before a couple trans-Atlantic flights and was a little disappointed.  The volume drop was very noticeable (possibly heightened by a noisy airplane cabin) and the connection had to be held in place for it to even work.  Rendered BOSE headphones into cheap ear buds.
1393,"Needed better protection than my $10 surge protector for my HT setup now that I have a couple DVRs & a plasma.  Filtering would be a nice side benefit too.  Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at (& now I see it dropped even lower!).Pros: Build quality, fit & finish, plenty of outlets & diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs & meter.Cons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed & are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers.  I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter.Bottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon."
1394,The packaging was nice. The cord is somewhat of good quality. The dual mono 1/4'' jacks are very sturdy and well built but the 1/8'' stereo connection isn't the best. I ordered 2 of these and with a little snag from an ipod when connected made the 1/8'' tip disconnect from inside.
1395,Too lazy to go out and put one up. This served its purpose. The color help identify what connection its for
1396,About my situation: I live about 12 miles west of most of the broadcast antennae for Digital TV in the DC area. Wanted an antenna that would get me access to most DTV stations without a lot of fuss. I have a coax cable run in my house that permits me to put the antenna on the top floor and connect it to my TV on the main floor.--I tried theTerk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5)which did not provide a significant improvement over the portable telescoping stub antenna that came with my WinTV Tuner.  That being said the reception was very slightly improved.Ended up purchasing and keeping theTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Receptionwhich was better for my situation.Be aware: This antenna is 2+ feet wide when fully assembled.  Takes up a lot of room.
1397,"I am not rating apples with apples, as my model is GS116 (nothing after the 116)Trouble shooting network problems for a Small Office is an internal affair, and having your network and internet all come slowly to a grinding crawl over 4 days rather than something just failing is a frustrating affair.This device failed after about 4 years,  I am somewhat disappointed when comparing it to the other devises on the same network."
1398,"After having used a mouse for hours a day for 10+ years, a bit of RSI/carpel tunnel (I don't know which) had started to kick in. So I tried several other mice, and finally switched to a Logitech trackball (Trackman Wheel Optical) and that helped to reduce some of the stiffness and pain I was feeling, but it did not eliminate it. Plus, the vein just to the left of my thumb has enlarged significantly, probably due to all the thumb movement from moving the trackball around. So, I once again went looking for alternatives.I had been waiting to get one of these Kensington trackballs for awhile, but their software (Mouseworks) was not fully compatible with Vista or Win7 64-bit. So when I heard that they had released new software (Trackballworks) for 64-bit, I went ahead and pulled the trigger. I had a chance to try out both Mouseworks and Trackball works, and am sad to report that, although the Trackball works supports customizing all buttons (as of May/June 2010), it's not quite as feature-rich as the older Mouseworks software. (For example, you can no longer customize the buttons on a per-app basis, though they may add this capability back in at a future date.) However, for those who know what AutoHotkey is, this isn't a huge problem, but does require you to get your hands a bit dirty with some scripting.But the real question is, how does it feel? The ball comes out spinning kind of rough out of the box, but if you've read many reviews of this trackball, you'll know that the 'oils' on your fingers will smooth it out pretty quickly, and that's what happened with mine. However, I found the unit to be too big, as my hand has to do gymnastics to be able to use the ball and hit all the buttons, and it basically transferred the pain from my hand to my wrist. (Trying with and without the included wrist rest didn't make much difference.) I tried changing which buttons did what, but it didn't really help. Plus, it was taking me twice as long as with my Logitech trackball to do complex operations, such as selecting text while using the scroll ring to scroll the page. And trying to speed things up would put too much strain on my hand.However, other folks would tell you that this trackball (and it's cousin, the Slimblade) is like the second coming, thus it's really hard to gauge how the unit will fit in your hand, because hands come in different sizes, and these things are very subjective. (My hands are of average size for a male). What feels great to one person will be very uncomfortable to another. The best advice I can give you is to try to find one locally and see how it feels in your hand. Barring that, I suppose you could always order one and return it if it doesn't feel 'right' to you.In the meantime, I am going back to my Logitech trackball, and maybe find another mouse or trackball that I can switch out every few hours. Unless somebody has any better ideas? (I make a living on my PC, so 'just using the computer less' isn't really an option, unless I don't want to eat.)"
1399,"These headphones are great, when buying these headphones don't expect major hardcore bass because that is not what they are meant for, they are evened out and have a very clear pleasant sound balancing all of the sounds in music, videos, etc."
1400,"This isn't the pair of binoculars you want for star gazing. Yes, the optics are great considering the price but they are so cheaply constructed that the smallest bump will knock them out of collimation. They arrived in perfect condition, but after a couple of months they started giving double images when star gazing (and yes, I know how to adjust them).I can't really recommed these because I have a pair of 10x50's that are the same price, a lot more compact, lighter, and they give way better views.Except for a spotting scope everything else I bought from Celestron has been substandard."
1401,"I purchased this item on Sept. 6 this year and haven't used it until a couple of days ago, then I found it didn't work at all. I thought that the battery was dead, so bought a new one and put it in. It still didn't work. I want to return or exchange, but realized that the return window has been closed on Oct. 17. What can I do?"
1402,These are good headphones for the price. They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum. I was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds. I use these with a Yamaha receiver. They deliver very good sound with this receiver. The receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones. That is something you should consider when choosing any headphones.
1403,I used this cable to connect my camcorder's DV out (Firewire) port to my DVD recorder's DV in port. It should work with any Sony camcorder that's iLink capable. I don't know about other brands. It works fine. I give it four stars because I haven't had it long enough to know how well it will hold up. It seems reasonably well made.
1404,"The bag's construction is very good, with enough padding for your typical camera buff. It held my D80, with 2 lenses, and the SB600 Flash easily. The side pockets are great for chargers and anything that won't fall out easily as they only close with a velcro fastener. The back pocket is great for paperwork, and the front pocket has plenty of pockets for all sorts of accessories.The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the wasted space that you end up with, using the interior dividers in the provided configuration. There is space below the camera body that's very hard to get into without removing the Velcro'd dividers. I ended up not using any of them and instead inserting a smaller bag I own that holds the camera and two lenses. Then I sandwich the flash (in its pouch) and a small tabletop tripod in the remaining space. Sounds crazy but it works better. Also cool if I want to grab the camera and just use the small bag for a quick shoot or for a lighter bag for a day's travel, leaving the larger Tamrac bag at home, or in the car. This way you don't have to move the camera and vital accessories from one bag to another.All this got me thinking. Tamrac could create a system like this, kind of like a backpack I own, the CamelBak Transformer, that allows one to remove sections depending on the hike you're planning."
1405,"Received the card promptly.The card would not work in either of my very old Olympus 370 cameras. Neither camera could format the card to Olympus standards. My new computer, however, did format the card and I could transfer pictues to and from the card on the computer, but still no luck in the cameras.My tech savvy friend could not get it to work either, despite 3 hours of trying everything he could think of. No help on the net, either--lots of suggestions and programs to fix it, but nothing worked.Near as we could tell, 4 of the 128 mbs had some sort of program written to them, as the computer showed 124 mb available. The computer ignored this, but the cameras could not.  Even a low level format could not remove the data on the 4 mb.My guess is the card had been previously formatted for another brand of camera, and we were unable to change that formatting to an Olympus standard.Two other, seemingly identical cards, purchased some time ago had no problems.  One of them was damaged, and this was to be its replacement."
1406,"If you have to use your button on the camera to take photos - this is not the tripod for you.  It's so flimsy that the weight from my lens causes the whole thing to wobble.  When I press the shutter button there is 10x more movement that if I had been holding the camera myself.  I had to use my remote.  Which was fine for this event, but shouldn't be a requirement.  It's cheap and not worth saving an extra 10$ :)  get a decent one and enjoy your tripod."
1407,"Well here is an up date to my last review, I know now not to by used CANON gear no matter how much you save! Come to think of it all my CANON gear VIDEO and Film and DIGITAL doesnt seem to hold up very well at all. YEP NO MORE CANON STUFF, Customer support from CANON bites the dig one as well.This little box aint so bad, It plays my recorded Tapes to my computer for editing, since my PRO grade CANON XL1S That refuses to without eating tapes, BUYER BEWARE! The used stuff can cost you more in the short term than you think, My CANON XL1S will cost me 350.00 to 500.00 plus shipping to get professionally repaired, this little Canon OPTURA 200MC save me from losing what might be the lastOf my KIDS Sports games. So If you have ISSUES with your CANON XL1S or got burned like I did, this will play then into your computer throughout the 1394 DV in/output cord although not the same resolution it will save your MEMORIES FROM BEING TOTALLY LOST!"
1408,I have tried this on both Windows Vista and Windows 7 (64-bit) and the driver causes the system to BSOD shortly after you begin using it. This happens every time.I downloaded the newest version from their website and it did not resolve the problem. I would not recommend this until they fix the Windows driver.I was able to get it to work under Linux without any issues.
1409,"I tried this lens on a Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I'm amazed at all of the positive reviews.  My results were very disappointing. Maybe I had a defective lens, but I don't think so.  Great Bokeh. Fast Lens. However, this lens had a VERY DIFFICULT time focusing on a subject. Auto focus was way off. Even in manual mode, getting a sharp focus was a real challenge at F1.8 or 2.8.  I switched my Canon Digital XT camera to spot center focusing and still had a difficult time getting a sharp image after taking many pictures. I would recommend testing this lens out before purchasing."
1410,Nice sound without burning a hole in your pocket. I also have Yamaha pro 300. Both are good. Sound qualityof both is very close but each has its own distinct quality. I like the Yamaha one being lighter but it costs a lot more.I just switch between them.
1411,These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.
1412,This sound much better than Sennheiser PX 100 (owned for about 2 years). It is comfortable on me but I just don't like style. PX100 look better.
1413,"I returned the product for refund for two reasons (1) one headphone arrived cracked and hanging off, and (2) there were no instructions on how to install, program, or use the product.It is the second reason that I'm most dissatisfied with the product."
1414,"My head was too big, they were too small and they were basically the same quality you can get at any drugstore or dollar store.  Not worth the effort to order online."
1415,"I purchased the ear buds after reading all the reviews, and thought for the price, it was a good deal. I think the sound is great, but finding a good position in you ear that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable is a challenge.Working out, they do slip out of your ears."
1416,"Well where do I start they don't fit well I am constantly adjusting them to keep them on my head, since KOSS has a lifetime warranty I had to replace them twice that is three headphones within a year. I lost sound in the right one on the first purchase then the left one, then the plug went.Not sure if they just gave me a refurbished headphone when I replace it the 2nd and 3rd time. Save yourself the headache try another headphone. I don't know what is going on with the quality of products but I have had headphones for my other players in the past that worked great. I guess I will keep looking."
1417,"I bought these back in 2010 and never get sick of them!Can crank them up full blast without 0 distortion!They make everything and anything sound so much better!And actually has a cord long enough so you can stand up, walk around, an dance, which they will make you want to do, when you are wearing them!The fact that they are that good and there must not be anything comparable being made probably explains why the price has skyrocketed since I bought mine."
1418,"I bought these because they were cheap and that is what I got. The sound is not that great, but the worst part is the headphones DIGGING INTO THE SIDE OF MY HEAD. After an hour I have to remove them due to the pain when the headphones squeeze my head.  Pay a little more and get something that is comfortable."
1419,"Arrived quickly, but poor quality. VERY LOUD humming comes through the cable, which makes it clearly useless for its purpose: listening to audio. And a 3.5mm falls constantly out of it with the slightest movement. It's too loose. Contacted the seller first, and was written off initially.  When I asked about options, only recourse offered was a &#34;premium upgrade.&#34;  Umm, no -- I just would've liked something that actually WORKED AS INTENDED/ADVERTISED, that didn't introduce super-loud background noise louder than the actual audio I'm trying to listen to. Fail."
1420,"Ugly as hell but they work well. I wouldn't wear them outside. I've been falling asleep with them on for maybe 8 days now and they haven't broken. Not uncomfortable to sleep with. Very light weight and feel good on my head and ward. Again, in case I wasn't clear.... they are really freaking ugly!"
1421,"I bought this years and years ago, died within a year of owning it.  Battery life was meh at best, sound quality was not very good, and I hated itunes.  obviously its an old model, but don't bother regardless.  I replaced it with a sony, which had awesome battery life and sound quality, plus was smaller, and still works after 3 years and being dropped and run over by a car, but had abysmal software that killed my old computer.  I have a 4gb zune now and love everything about it."
1422,"I have already taken several pictures with it.  It does appear to enhance the blueness of the sky, however I do not see a difference when rotating it.  Will try it against the glare of water."
1423,There's not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Highly recommended.
1424,I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these.
1425,"The filter fits well to my HP 2570P 12.5 inch screen. However, it does not block the view efficiently if I put the filter on the screen, unless moving the filter away from the screen"
1426,"I have a degree in Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley, so I'm not usually intimidated by technology.  But this remote is just impossible.  Lots of tiny, identical buttons with microscopic labels.  You can only use the remote using reading glasses in a strong light.  Many of the controls are non-intuitive even when you find the right buttons.  The manual is strikingly unhelpful; one of the worst I've seen.I actually bought a universal remote but this deck wouldn't respond to it at all.(Rant: user interface design is a well-understood discipline, so why is it that user interfaces seem to be getting worse rather than better?)  Anyway, I returned it and got a JVC XVC33U, which is much easier to use and has a vastly better manual."
1427,Cheap cable but it works.  Not very durable. I used this for an outdoor installation and haven't had any issues yet.  If I were to do it again I would get something with a thicker shell.
1428,"I bought these earphones as an addition to the Koss earphones I already own.  The sound is OK, but not as good as I expected and the ""holder"" is a joke.  Would not buy them again at any price.  The Koss earphones are better quality, better sound and a real pouch to hold them for less money."
1429,"I have been using these headphones for nearly eight years, and they still sound incredible.  They catch the highest highs and lowest lows, and the construction is built to last.  I use these for DJing and I have hauled these headphones to countless clubs and gigs with nary a problem in all the years I've used them.  I also have a pair at home that sound great no matter what you're plugging them into, be it a stereo, an ipod, or a television set.  For the price, you simply cannot get a better pair of headphones for the price.  Buy with confidence!"
1430,"What an AWESOME camera -- I can't say enough good about this camera.  It is so user friendly that we purchased it for my 70+ year old parents for Christmas, and they are already using it to sell things at online auction  sites.  Resolution is EXCELLENT, ease of use is exceptional, and you cannot  beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling  up the images -- WHY would anyone waste their time (and more importantly  their money) on those digital cameras with dumb &quot;smart cards&quot;  that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software.  The Sony comes with respectable software, but I HIGHLY recommend purchasing  PICTURE IT software -- it is ideal for use with this camera.  If I had one  criticism it would be about storage space - the floppies don't hold as many  pictures as I'd like, but it's really not a big issue unless you're going  out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing  through them later (in which case you just need to take some spare floppies  with you).  Truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediately."
1431,"I have had these headphones for over a year and am 100% satisfied.  I use them exclusively for working out and running.  They have pretty good sound, a nice carrying case, and have survived over a year's worth of running.  I have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out.  In fact, I use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when I run.  Despite this, no problems.This is probably the best pair of earbud-style headphones I have ever purchased.  I am so happy that I am ordering another pair."
1432,"This 35mm is pretty much the perfect college kid film camera.  It wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning, which will really help you in the long run.  In the age of ""press this button and you're focused"", this camera is one of the few 35mm's left that doesn't have AF.  Also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggests(such as AV or TV mode some cameras have), this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit.  As for manual focus, it's something you need to be able to do as a photographer.  Sometimes the computer in your camera just doesn't focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus, or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth you're going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for you.This lens is great because it's like the vintage 35mm except you don't have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken.  Nor do you have to worry about the image quality.  The kit lens in this camera is very sharp.  It's a bit limiting considering it's f/3.5 so that rules out really low light(but grain can be good, unlike noise in digital; grain has an artistic quality), but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit it's great.Sure you can get a used one from the 70's or 80's for way cheaper, but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until you've invested 2 hours developing the first roll in your class...So shell out a little bit extra and get this, it's worth it.edit 12-9-10:I still like this, shot some street photography with it since it's really compact compared to a big DSLR, but one big con I've found is build quality. It's got a lot of plastic, and I did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent. The silver parts look metal but they aren't, they're some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic. I don't baby my gear so this thing's starting to look kinda ugly.  It hasn't completely broken yet though.  I said the kit lens was sharp in my review, but really I now know it's not as good as I made it out to be, I recommend a used nikon e series 50mm 1.8 ais which can be had for cheap on the used market."
1433,Cable converters. They do what they say they do. Nothing more nothing less. I don't even use. They came with some thing else.
1434,"The connectors on these cables are WAY TOO THICK!!! They really don't fit on the component jacks on my BRAND NEW SAMSUNG LCD TV OR my DVD player! I had to force them on, it made horrific crunching sounds, and I probably damaged my equipment from pushing so hard on the jacks and spreading them apart because of the girth of these things. As you can see in the above pic, they can't fit side by side, so the jacks are forced to spread apart.  I have really never been so angry, and I feel like suing monster.  Oh yeah, and THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TERRIBLE! My S-video looked much better, now I have interference lines.  Do not go with Monster, they are an outrageous joke."
1435,"Wanted to take some landscape photos and needed a polarizing filter. My lens is a 28-300 vr fx so the filter had both to be accessible and not alter the cameras ability to focus.This filter does an excellent job if used properly in landscape, however I would recommend removing the filter once you have finished as you can get some unexpected results if you use it indoors or with flash."
1436,I use this for keyboards and short jumper runs on unbalanced systems. Other than that they are durable with a cover that resists kinking.
1437,"This tripod is barely adequate for holding a small digicam,provided there is no breeze, e.g. so you can be in self-timer shots.Legs are so wobbly that, unlike most tripods,it is more stable with the center post cranked upand bottom leg sections retracted.The pan-tilt is anything but fluid, andthe quick-release is not clamped securely.A Targus or similar available at Walmart is better at this price."
1438,"I thought this was going to be the perfect input device. After all it looks like the old Turbo Mouse (v. 4 &amp;5) and it does have that ingenious scroll ring. But after a few hours I packed it up and returned it.While it does look right, it doesn't feel right. The old Expert and Turbo mice had a steel ball bearing movement that felt great: smooth and steady. While the new Expert Mouse 7 may have better technology (optical tracking) it doesn't feel the same at all. Upon closer inspection you'll see plastic nubs that support the main track ball where there used to be steel rollers. While I'm not advocating that they lose the optical sensor I don't see why they couldn't have kept the steel wheels that gave the unit such great feel.That being said, it does look great and the scroll ring is also very nice. I just wished they hadn't changed what made the old Expert/Turbo mice so great."
1439,"I have owned two pairs of these since 1988.  They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then.  They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.  I went without nice headphones for several years, I am very happy that they still sell this model, they are compact, have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame.  They are by far the best value in headphones, kudos for Sony for keeping production running."
1440,"As a portable music user since the mid 80s I have gone through many many Sony headphones over the years. From using outrageously priced tiny cassette Walkmans to minidisc to MP3 players. In the old days it was no problem to chuck the headphones that came with the players and buy a quality replacement pair for around twenty dollars. Not so now. These headphones are OK for casual everyday use (I use mine for walking/hiking so I can't comment on exercise/sweat endurance). I don't find them near as fragile as a lot of users are making them out to be, but I also don't expose them to any rough handling. The plastic is not as durable as the old Sonys were but is fine if you do no major folding or extreme flexing of the headband.Sound quality is just OK with 320 kbps MP3 files on my Sandisk M240 & 250 players, not much high end detail or solid bass, but you can do a lot worse for a lot more money. Headphones are comfortable enough and really stay in place.All in all a good buy for the ten bucks you pay. Buy two with one for a spare and I think you will be happy with them."
1441,"A high-quality headphone like this is something that will change the way you hear music. The full, bold, clear sound it produces is heavenly. I've been hearing all my old favorites, songs which I've heard THOUSANDS of times, and in many of them I notice sounds and instruments I never picked up, not in my JBL speakers, not in my old crappy Dell speakers, not in any of the other various headphones I've owned.It is very comfortable to use, very adjustable (it has adjustments on both arc length and speaker angle) and looks durable too, even with all the folding it needs to perform to fit in the small bag it came with."
1442,This is a cable only splitter make sure you know that before you buy it.  It would not let me see cable and have my ant hooked up at the same time bc of the freq range for it is too small.  its ok I use it well on my other tv though just for the ant and another device.
1443,"i'm a professional dj, and i've been using my mdr.4700dj for almost ten years.  they're the best dj monitor headphones i've owned.  i know many new products (such as the popular pioneers) have come out since; and to be honest, i haven't tried many of them; but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past.  when you first get them, you might get confused about how to fold them back up. i think i was confused for a little, but maybe i'm just not that bright.  the sound is great, and the construction is definitely solid."
1444,"These are just too damn tight for comfortable use over any length of time. Perhaps they were intended for people with very small heads. The tightness is not adjustable though they can be lengthened to the point where they don't fit. Bargain priced, but no bargain!"
1445,"IVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE CONTACT POINTS NOT KEEPING CONSTANT CONTACT, WHICH DID NOT ALLOW THE ANTENNA TO EVER RELIABLY WORK, UNLESS I PUSH IT CONSTANTLY AT SOME ANGLE.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EVER!"
1446,"I must say that this was a breeze (under 5 min) to set up.  I do not know why the others had problems. Pluged it in, Win98 picked up the new device, pointed it to the drivers on the CD, cranked up net meeting, and I was off!If you want fast top notch quality video, then spend more on a better  web cam, but if you just want a basic (with some cool features like zoom) camera for a very low price, then this is the camera for you.  I do not regret  buying it, as it was a great, cheap, way for me to get my feet wet with video conferencing, among other things.Enjoy."
1447,"I agree with almost all of the good things you have probably already read about this camera, so I won't repeat them.  Still, there are a few areas where Fuji really failed.  The most annoying is that you cannot buy an adapter for mounting filters to the lens.  When you pay this much for a camera with a good lens, you should be able to protect it with an inexpensive clear filter.  As it stands, you have to buy an expensive macro adapter you may not need in order to get the filter ring.  This seems like a customer-unfriendly approach.The autofocus is very slow in all but the most ideal conditions.  You can't capture an expression on someone's face indoors (even in a brightly lit room) unless you go to manual focus.  Also, battery life is too short, especially when the spares they sell are expensive and have a lower capacity than the original equipment.I know this sounds very negative, but in fact the camera is very good in other ways.  I have taken some very nice pictures with it.  Just think carefully about what you want out of any digital camera before you buy."
1448,"The headphones deliver good sound and seal off the ambient noise almost completely. Unfortunately after a very short time the cheap plastic band broke off  next to a hinge, and the cord started fraying next to the plug. I would not recommend it."
1449,"I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots."
1450,"I have only used this power filter, and the Montster Power HTS1000, but I can notice a difference between the two in my home theatre and audio system.  I upgraded from the HTS1000 to the HTS3500 to help get rid of the pop I would sometimes see on the screen, or hear in my music due to a large appliance in my apartment complex.  This device has done more than just get rid of that, but it has really enhanced my digital products (DVD and CD) with it's special filter sections.  My CD player sounds more focused, and the ocassions I hear any &quot;digital jitter&quot; are far less.  Besides enhancing my system in that way, it is a great looking unit, and goes well with my system.  I feel; however, that the LED's are two bright, and the outlets should have a selection to be switched or un-switched.  Besides that, a great unit.  If you don't own any type of power filter, get one.  They are so much more than just surge suppressors."
1451,"I love these, I went through a couple of headphones before I found these and I had planned to try as many as possible Until I found the ones I was completely happy with, well I stopped. I tried the JVC Black Series and a couple of Bose and none of them sounded like what I was looking for, not that they where bad, just not what I was looking for. These sound exactly like what I had in mind, the sound is very clear and crisp, I'm hearing parts of my music that I never even knew where there. I listen to a Lot of different Genres; Rap, R&B, Rock, and Hip Hop to name a few. Everything sounds great, the only thing about these is that if your looking for Thumping Bass these aren't for you, Not that they don't have Bass, its just not thumping Bass but Definitely there. Before you go and spend over a $100 on Bose or anything else I would give these a look, you won't regret it."
1452,"I've had my Nomad Jukebox 6gig for about a year now, and I still love it.  Sure, it's got it's cons, but overall it is a cool, reliable and swanky little bit of electronics.Here are the cons:Easy to use...one you get the hang of it.  I agree that the documentation for the unit is pretty substandard and the interface is non-intuitive.  But once you work your way through it and become accustomed to it, it is easy to use--easy to add, delete, make play lists, etc.Upload and download--Move stuff from your PC onto your Jukebox, then back again!  Some reviewers have said they can't do this, but I do it all the time.  No probs.Battery life--About 4 hours with each set of batteries...and you get two sets.  That's pretty good.  WARNING:  when they say 12 hours the first time you charge, they mean 12 hours.  Any less, and you've screwed your batteries for good.Playcenter software--actually this is easier to use and more intuitive than the Jukebox's internal software.  Great, easy, reliable and fast.Cons:The carry case sucks...buy another quickly.  I bought the larger padded case from Creative, with plenty of room for headphones, a car adapter, extra batteries.  And it has zippered access to the ports, so you don't have to haul it out every time you want to connect it.Ummm...that's it, really...although I wish it played Audible content.  Maybe a future upgrade.An excellent buy, especially now that you can get a 20gig one."
1453,I chose this rating because to no fault of my own it stopped working. I have it plugged in to my computer and mixer. I never touch the cables after installed or moved the mixer. Yet some how the right channel stopped working. I plugged the right plug in to other jacks on my mixer even tried plugging the right plug in to the left of my mixer. Found out it was the cable.
1454,"This anti-static wrist band makes it safer when working on my computer, I gives me peace of mind knowing i wont shock my computer's parts."
1455,Set up was simple. Plug and play. I've been using Belkin products for nearly 20 years. Never a problem. Recommended.
1456,"I first got a hold of my first pair of Sony MDR V6 Monitor Series Headphones in the late 90's.  Oddly enough, it cost about the same back then as it does today. The sound was phenomenal.  You actually had to lift the headphone to make sure the bass was not coming from the room.  Not that the base was unusually loud, it was just that is sounded so real.  These were studio quality headphones that were actually used in studios.  You would see these Sony headphones in practically every music video that was shot in a studio.Fast forward about 10 years, the headphone craze starts up. Every audio company want to break into the headphone market.  Sony adds newer models of headphone that still can't live up to the MDR V6's,  I decided that I wanted to replace the Sony MDR V6 headphones that had gotten lost long ago.  Used MDR V6 headphones were selling for over $150 if you could find them at all.  So I did a little research and found out that although there was a demand for these headsets, Sony had discontinued the MDR V6 line anyway. Luckily, the reason that I could not find the V6's was the when the headphones were first re-issued, they sold out immediately. Although I had to wait months, I finally got my replacement Sony MDR V6's.So what did I get for all this waiting?  I received a true studio tested headset that has a sound so clear that you wonder whether its actually coming from your headset.  Unlike some other headphones, the V6's did not artificially increase the treble or base.  These Sony's were designed to be studio reference headphones which required them to have a flat, unmodified sound.  In my opinion, these headphones are classics that arguably outperform newer and more expensive headphones."
1457,"Works great and appears to be sturdy but the 1/8"" end is very wide and won't fit into a few things. Namely my iPhone."
1458,"The sound is decent enough for a $30 pair of headphones so I gave it two stars, a little better than the $14 Koss Plug headphones that I have.  However, what is annoying about this product is the asymetrical way the wires are layed out:1. One side (the left) is shorter than the right side.  That means the wires will always be hanging from the left side of you.  The wires for the right side have to either hang under your chin or lay on the back of your (often sweaty) neck.  If you like the feeling of wires on your neck then this won't be a problem.2. Since the wires extend down the left side it always feels like something is pulling the left side of my head.3. This head phone comes in two pieces.  The actual head phone wires are very short, I guess intended for those who wear their players like a necklace?  Or arm band but then you'd have to wear it on the left side.  I put my player into my pocket so I have to use the extension cord which makes the wires extremely long.  So I am running around with long wires hanging out of my pocket!  Why didn't they make the extension cord make the total length normal like their other headphones.  If people wanted to sit far away from the player then they can buy a proper extension cord.I must have bought over a dozen Sony headphones in my life and I've never had any problems with the designs until now.  I used to love their designs and thought they were innovative.  But now, I am dissappointed.  Now I have to worry about what kind of funky design they are using... No thanks."
1459,The sound quality these give out is distance and not all the music. You would need to plug in hafe way for the sound to be corrected.
1460,"I was a little disappointed, i had a few cables with loose ends and a couple of cable ends that had a rusty look. Not sure I will purchase these cables thru here again."
1461,"OK, this was kind of an impulse buy.  I've had a problem watching TV late at night because if I turn the TV up loud enough to understand voices, my wife can't sleep.  I'd considered headphones (cordless), but ruled them out as I like to lie down to watch TV, and headphones would be uncomfortable.  Then I thought about putting speakers in the headboard of my bed, on my side.  That way, I could add volume on my side of the bed only.  It worked, by the way.  If you have a problem with a spouse who can't sleep while you are watching TV, try a set of small speakers on your side of the bed only.Anyway, I'd go with Altec Lansing speakers for better sound (I already own them, and use them with my computer), but the only decent ones I could find at the CC I shopped in were much more than I wanted to spend.  These Cyber Acoustic speakers were well within my price range, so I decided to give them a shot.The cabling of these speakers is horrible.  The actual speaker wires are extremely thin and flimsy.  What's worse, is that the speakers are packaged from the factory with about 6"" (six INCHES) of separation between the left and right speakers.  I'm not exaggerating.  I almost returned them as (at first) I thought this was a factory defect.  After all, you couldn't even use the speakers if they could only be separated by such a short distance.  Then I noticed that the clip (which holds the left and right speaker wires together) was adjustable.  This isn't much help, however.  After you move the clip, the wires still need to be TORN apart to increase the separation between the speakers.  The wires are so flimsy that it would be VERY easy to damage your speaker wires doing this.  Another problem with the speaker wires is that they are permanently fixed to the speakers.  Why is this a problem?  Well it's not a problem, unless you need to mount the speakers in a cabinet of some kind, and want to route the wires out of sight.  See, there's no way to pass the wires THROUGH a cabinet from one speaker to the other, without having to put a whole speaker through the cabinet.  In my case, the areas of my headboard between the left and right speaker are separated by a divider.  I wanted to route the cables through the back of the headboard, but I couldn't.  I had to settle for leaving the cables on the headboard with the speakers.  This looks ugly, and the cables interfere with my storing other stuff in the headboard. (such as TV remote)On sound quality . . . well, I bought these things to listen to TV with.  We have Dish Network satellite service.  I used RCA style cables to connect the Dish Network receiver to these speakers, using an adapter that came with the speakers.  For TV use, the sound is OK.  To get the subwoofer volume control (this is a separate control from main volume) set correctly, I hooked up a DVD player to these speakers and listened to one of my favorite music CDs.  These speakers have lots of really low bass.  That's not necessarily good.  See, while it has lots of low bass, the mid-bass response is rather lacking.  So with these speakers you either have not enough bass, or too much low bass, depending on how you adjust the subwoofer.For the price, the sound isn't too bad.  I wouldn't recommend these speakers if your primary use is to listen to music though.  As I said before, to listen to TV, the sound is decent.  I imagine these speakers would be good for computer gaming, also.By the way, Cyber Acoustics claims these speakers are 60W.  They could be, but CC seems to think that they are 40W.  I like the power switch and ANALOG volume control on the right satellite speaker.  These controls are handy, and work well.If you need speakers for music use, I'd recommend something by Altec Lansing.  But try to get an analog volume control, if possible.  My Altec Lansing three piece computer speakers are simply awesome for music use (mp3 files and such).  They sound MUCH better than my new Cyber Acoustics speakers.  But I don't like the digital up/down volume buttons on my Altec Lansing speakers.  -Dave"
1462,"A lot of these kits are over burdened with tools that you will honestly never need. I've found this to be perfect not just for fixing PCs but also for fixing up electronics in general. The Soldering Iron is cheap and without a case.The first time I used it it looked like it was going to burst into flames before it finally settled down, and somewhat annoyed no stand came with it. The rest of the products work great.Since it was impossible for me to find an exact list of the products here you go:Screw driver handle with various bitssoldering ironneedle nose plierswire cuttersmall screw driver and bits (in the blue case)Wide tongsnarrow nosed tongsAllen Key setLong narrow screw driverrazor knifeCable Cutter/crimpervarious hex socket wrench bitsgrabber tooldusting brushand last but not least the most worthless flashlight you will ever see. Seriously, take the batteries out and put them in a good flashlight you buy yourself, then take this POS and use it to play fetch with your dog..I think I missed a few, but they are just fluff pieces I haven't had to use.The quality of the tools are strong and durable, and the only way they could be better is if 1 of the screw drivers was magnetized to help retrieve the screws, but not the end of the world."
1463,"These are the official headphones for the Holosync user.  I have used them with some of the new audio 3-d sound that the higher levels of HOLOSYNC use and they were amazing.  The ""knock"" at the door and the ""whisper"" in one ear, on the demo CD, for the sound technology, I think it is called ""AudioPhonics"" made me jump thru the roof - the sound was SO REAL!  I think these headphones are very comfortable - they have the adapters - both small and large - that come with them, you don't have to buy separate ones, and the cord is long, flexible and coiled.  I thought Amazon had a VERY decent price for them, I've seen them at 2x or 3x the price.  No complaints at all - I really like them a lot."
1464,Works as advertised.  Filters out reflections from water and haze from our South Carolina sun. Pictures are sharper with no &#34;fuzzyness&#34;
1465,"I bought my wife one of these to replace her aging Pentax K1000. She is very happy with the features and the light weight, as well as its ease of operation...you can run it as a point-and-shoot camera, fully manual, or any of a number of modes in between. The only negative to this camera is the standard 28-80 lens, but if you are a casual photographer you won't mind its mediocure optical performance. Remember, this is a relatively inexpensive camera and it has a lot of features for the money. If you want to spend more on the lens, get the excellent Canon 28-105 lens, or for more flexability get one of the third party 28-300 lenses (which aren't great optically but again are a great value).I own a Canon Elan IIe, which is a better camera in some ways but I would certainly recommend the Rebel 2000 to anyone wanting a superior point and shoot, a photography student, or a traveller needing light weight and do-it all capability, or even as a second body for someone with another Canon camera (I'm thinking about this myself)."
1466,"I selected the A-70 because it ran on AA cells (don't have to lug a charger around - although you will probably need to anyway because of alkalines' short life in the camera) and had a good variety of features. After a couple of years with the camera and several thousand exposures, some observations:- Optical viewfinder is junk - but this seems to be common in cameras of this price range. Shows only about 70% of view, and mine is also off about 10 degrees in rotation.- Picture quality is excellent as long as the ""ASA"" is kept on Auto or at or below 100. ""Auto ASA"" will net shutter/apertures at ASA 50 equivalent. At ASA 200 and 400, there is lots of noise and the camera will overexpose pictures taken in daylight.- Picture quality as ""high ASA"" speeds (200,400) has deteriorated over time. Beware if you are buying used. Pictures taken in low light are filled with noise, streaks, and ""sparkles"".- Power management is poor. Batteries die without warning (I've never seen the ""low battery"" indication), and camera has gotten ""stuck"" a couple of times in a mode where it seems to think even fresh batteries are no good; it has recovered after a few minutes with the batteries removed. Can take about 120 no-flash pictures on a set of 2000 maH NiMhs, with LCD mostly on. Battery life on alkalines is shorter than high-capacity NiMh's.- Autofocus has failed on about 1% of pictures."
1467,Have gone through 8 of the cases so far and found one to have a broken hinge. Not a good percentage rate.
1468,"These are really tight!Delivers good bass, but sound is lacking on the high end.Construction is up to Sony's usual high standards."
1469,I bought a pair at a box store at least 7 years ago. I think there great. I live in an apartment now and I use them a lot more than I did when I had my own place.
1470,"Pro: With the rebate, this is an excellent price for a USB 2.0 hub. I've had up to 6 USB 2.0 devices connected to it without any problems. I've had it for almost a year.Con: Does not work well with USB 1.1 devices. I connected a USB 1.1 scanner to the hub. For about one out of every 6 scans, the scanner will lock up and I have to reboot the PC to restart it. If I connect the USB 1.1 scanner through a USB 1.1 hub, then it locks up about once every 25 scans. In any case, ALL the USB devices slow down significantly when the USB 1.1 scanner was connected - It didn't matter whether or not I was using the scanner. My USB 1.1 printer also causes the slowdown. My solution was to wire my USB 1.1 hub directly to my PC and have it only drive my USB 1.1 devices.As a side note, disconnecting the USB 1.1 device while the PC was on did not improve the speed. The USB 1.1 device had to be disconnected before the PC is powered on to get maximum speed."
1471,"This antenna seems to get mixed reviews, but I decided to give it a try.  As many others have said, it just doesn't seem to work in my area.  My &#34;T&#34; wire antenna gets better results."
1472,"For the price, this cable is everything you need. I use it to connect my printer to my pc. The length is great since my printer is on the top shelf of my desk and my computer sits on the floor. The quality is pretty fantastic too as it's not flimsy and the ends feel like they're pretty high quality (ie. they snap in well and stay in the female jacks). I've had this cable for around a year and have never had any problems with signal loss or anything like that. The usb end that connects to the pc has a pretty standard/low profile so my other USB plugs can jack in right next to it with no problem. If I needed more, I'd definitely order this again."
1473,"The old adage of you get what you pay for holds true with the SanDisk Imagemate.  I bought it only because of it's low, low price and the fact that I had a $25.00 gift certificate.  I read everyone else's review and found it to be just as described by the others. The SanDisk web page is not at all useful.  With as many systems being shipped today with Windows ME installed, you'd think there would be a section covering ME problems. Nope, not a word about this thing working with ME.The software drivers that ship with this unit are of course outdated, so after trying to get the Imagemate to run and being unable to find it on my USB system, I downloaded the new drivers and found the patch for the adaptec software conflict. I installed it again per the instructions after of course removing it from my system and it fired right up.Once again, getting what you pay for, the construction of the imagemate is kind of cheap. The compact flash does not gently slide into the media slot, instead you have to kind of push, jiggle and hope that it goes in properly.It seems to be working properly, I'm not getting any conflicts or inablity to read my CF. I only have 32mb cards so I can't testify how it will work with higher capacity or with a SM adapter.All in all not a bad deal for less than $25.00,  just a bit of install hassle."
1474,"As far as Palm-O/S compatible organizers, nothing beats this one.  8 megs of ram, color screen, upgrade slot, Palm-O/S 3.5.  The only drawbacks are that the O/S is in ROM rather than EEPROM (aka flash) and the battery life, even with the hard-wired lithium-ion battery is one quarter of any of the greyscale organizers.If you need color, and keep it charged, and don't mind a ROM O/S, then this is the one for you.The only organizer better than this (excluding the Windows-CE jobs, which are really palmtop computers, not PDAs) is the Agenda.  Agenda developer model is 16m ram, 8m rom, strong-arm CPU, PDA software, reads Palm data, and it runs stron-ARM Linux. It's cheaper than any of the other pda's on the market and great for the hackertype."
1475,"I bought 3 different sets of headphones and this is the set I ended up keeping.  These are comfy, sound great, and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses.  Did i mention they sound awesome?>"
1476,"I bought this unit on the strength of its consumer reviews as well as on the virtue of its affordable price.  Contrary to some of the reviews, the software is not so difficult to use.  In fact, despite some minor irritations, this is an overall good product.  But only for the first several months.  I had mine for two-and-a-half wonderful months, and it worked great in that period of time.  I used it for running and it served its purpose more than adequately.  Then it happened; the very thing I had heard about from other reviewers actually happened to me.  It stopped working.  No error message, no response, no startup, nothing.  So I called the manufacturer for a frustrating ""troubleshooting"" call with RCA's customer service department (by the way, you should be warned: their customer service dept. is not toll free; it's a long distance number and they like to make you wait on hold before and during the call).  To save the boring details, I've now had to call them three times about my MP3 player which they told me to send back to their service center.  It's been at their center for over six weeks and they refuse to offer any details as to where it is, what's wrong with it, or whether or not I'll ever see it again.  I will never buy another RCA product.  If any of this sounds exaggerated, do some research.  In under two minutes of brief internet searching, I came across three websites dedicated to the victims of RCA products and customer service.  Here's my objective, rational advice: just buy someone's else's product."
1477,"Beware! The lens gets stuck on the camera (Google + Youtube). I didn't think mine would end up getting stuck, but after 2 years owning it - it finally did. I had to break it in order to be able to use my camera again."
1478,"This is stranded cable not solid, therefore it doesn't work for in the wall installation. There is no mention  of which type this is in the description. It works fine for patch cables though. Definitely not an installation kit."
1479,"If you have a Canon G1 or G2 digital camera, you've probably noticed the limitations of the built-in flash.  It's way too close to the lens, which causes images to look flat and lifeless, and the color of the light tends to wash out colors as well.The Canon Speedlite 420 is a pretty big device; it's basically the same size as the camera, and about the same weight w/ batteries.  For that additional bulk, however, you get a powerful flash that can bounce light off walls and ceilings, creating much more professional-looking results.  The improvement over the built-in is really like night and day."
1480,"I order these headphones in May 2012 and I've been using these since on average about 6hrs/day up until about August, and have been using them on and off since. These are GREAT headphones! They produce quality sound, provide great comfort (even for giant Dumbo ears like mine), and they're super sturdy. There are my first pair of headphones of this quality so I don't really have anything to compare to other than Beats ear buds, but these are two very different products. In all, these outperform the Beats earbuds in every aspect except for portability, comfort, and sound cancelling ability.These headphones will take some time to get use to if you're not used to wearing bulky headphones; they weight about a pound or so. With the weight, the band tends to sit on the top of head, regardless of how I adjust it, and it caused a little pain initially but it's no longer a problem because I've gotten used to it. The headphones are completely over the ears, so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well; I've also gotten used to this. One other problem is the adapter, the 3.5mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like 2-2.5"" so it's nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline (ie: on a laptop chill pad, or even watching it on your lap).Even with this all said it's still the best pair of headphones I've owned and it seems like it'll continue providing quality sound for many years to come."
1481,"I purchased this product after confirming from Motorola Talkabout website[...]that this cradle charger is compatible with MT352R; but it is not!!!It is actually an upgrade kit for lower end talkabout products.I can't return it as I've taken it out of country.Anyhow, the MT352R comes with a wall charger; so, this becomes a cradle-stand."
1482,I've tried burning data onto these from my HP 1040 burner and the UJ-852 burner in my laptop.  My kids also have a high failure rate on these with their Macbook burners.  They're just junk.  Stay away from them.  (I have good luck generally with Verbatim disks.)
1483,Not a favorite.  I've gone back to the over-ear unit I was using prior to this purchase.
1484,"hooked it up, the connection was great, turn the CB on and it was like there was nothing attatched.  Turned it a bit, thinking a better fitting connection might work, little boost came in.  Tried to see if I could make it more functional somehow and the antenna fell apart in my hands where the extension meets the base above the coiled portion.  Seems like a really porely made item that I'd have thought would have been great. Nothing about teh packaging suggests it's actually distributed by Cobra, so I have no idea who made this waste of time and money."
1485,"If You thought Chung's review was late, mine is much later, just got this camera off EBAY for $50.00, seller said the batteries only lasted 3-5 mins and included two spare NP 80 batteries, the wide angle lens and adapter and a nice case for $50.00. I found out the ""battery problem: was the camera's auto shut-off setting after 3-5 mins. I'm not saying the batteries last a long time, far from it and as everybody has stated, get an extra one as they warning light did start blinking after about 60 shots. Took some amazing shot using macro and flash together. Good camera if you can get a package deal like I did along with some Smartmedia cards with it too, too expensive to buy alone."
1486,Good to have especially in sunny shots. Seems to make all photos more clear. Good feature to have when taking outdoor photos and under flourescent light.
1487,"I never got this card to work.  After installing the software, it detected a 'poor' connection to my home wireless network whereas my Netgear card shows a 'very good' at the same location.  I never got the Internet to work after messing with setup for quite a while.  The software routes you through the XP networking wizard and other REALLY UNHELPFUL software.  I would advise everyone to go Netgear or something else.  The range is bad, setup is way too difficult, and the product is not user friendly."
1488,"I purchased this product to connect my Logitech Trackman Marble FX trackball to my computer through a USB port. It does work for that purpose, but is not at all reliable. This device loses mouse clicks frequently, up to 50% of the time, making it virtually unusable for my purposes. I replaced it with a straight PS/2 extension cable to the PS/2 port of the computer and the clicks are all getting through just fine now.UPDATE:I got a new laptop at work and it didn't have any PS2 ports at all so I took this adapter in to connect my PS2 keyboard to the new computer. Another fail on the part of the adapter. The keyboard would show up if you plugged it in after the laptop was booted up. But if the keyboard was left connected then the computer wouldn't recognize it all after boot up.This adapter is relegated to the bottom of my computer junk drawer now!"
1489,"I tried using this for a radio that I bought ti get a station that is 50 miles away and it did not work. Now with cell phones having internet, I am sure you would do better to get a cell phone to listen to the radio from."
1490,About 10 or so were broken towards the middle of the pack. Annoying. But they do well in distributing product to clients!
1491,This is the third Sony personal headphone model that I have tried and this model has the same problem as the other two. Once any moisture gets into the jack for the headphones you lose sound in one ear piece first then in both. I just bought this model and used it for only TWO times. Perhaps is suitable for indoor use for people who don't perspire. For outdoor use its a piece of junk like the other two Sony models I have wasted my money on.
1492,"Does a fine job; doubles as neutral density filter. I wish it came in the older style container, which was round and small. Now comes in a large rectangular box that wastes a lot of room in my backpack."
1493,"I got this lens for a wedding I shot. Since I only had one camera at the time, I was afraid of losing shots as I switched back and forth. Since I was in need, I paid full retail price. Couple of comments. You need to have an external flash and be able to do bounce lighting for this lens to be really useful inside. Its a slow lens as the aperature is small. This lens is what I would call an ""average"" lens. It does everything good but nothing great. The advantages of this lens is the great focal length capability. 28-200mm covers alot of ground. If you travel and you just want to keep memories for yourself and keep your film/digital camera at full auto or f/ 5.6 to 8, you will get great results. use a 580 or a 430 ex flash and that will help compensate for indoors. I think the focal lengths work better for full frame or film cameras over the small sensor digital cameras.The thing about this lens is the greatest asset of the lens is also the greatest weakness. To be able to provide 28mm-200mm at 350-500 bucks, it requires alot of compromises. Its slow indoors or requires flash which for most people is okay. you will get softness if you blow pictures up past 8x10. Its heavy and long. It doesn't have a small depth of focus for your close ups, it needs to be on a tripod for 200mm unless you can hold it very steady and even then you will want a flash.If you want a good all around lens under 400.00 this is your lens. If you want to spend a little more you get IS and USM with the 28-135mm. My feeling is, you take great pictures with a lens you have, not a lens you don't have. I think for begineers and for a fun day just shooting regular pictures, this is a great lens. Save the artsy pictures and the emotional pictures for a 50mm 1.4 or a 85mm 1.8 or a up close picture for the 70-200mm. This is a good all around for good pictures, not great ones."
1494,My headphones are a bit worse for wear (my fault) but these are my go-to headphones when I really want to enjoy a piece. Good frequency response high and low. Very comfortable even with all-day use.
1495,"wasted .06 cents with this purchase, sound cut out if you even touch the cable the very first time i plugged it in, its six cents for a reason, stay away from this"
1496,"The video quality was very good.That said, there are plenty of reasons I returned this model.1) This VCR is much bigger than it looks.  I liked my previous JVC model so well that when it finally broke, I bought this one to replace it.  However, when I unpacked it and went to put it in the entertainment shelf, it wouldn't fit!!!  It is one of the widest VCR's I've seen.2) You MUST use the remote to do scheduled recordings.  Their is no menu button on this VCR.  In fact, there are not even any channel buttons (though the channel functions are available as secondary functions of other unrelated buttons).  Personally this was the deal breaker for me.  We lose our remote so often, and record things by timer very frequently, so not being able to schedule a recording from the console is unacceptable.3)  The ITR record button does not display the incremental time.My previous model would display 30, 1:00, 1:30, etc each time I pressed the record button to tell me how long it would record.  This model you have to keep track of those times in your head as you repeatedly push the button, becuase it doesn't dipslay anything.4)  The FF/REW is slow.  I did manage to get it to fast-forward in two speeds, but neither was impressive.  On a positive note, this VCR does a great job of easing into and out of FF/REW modes for protection of your tapes.I could go on, but you get the idea.  For some reason, JVC decided to &quot;dumb down&quot; this VCR.  And, from what I can see, it is the most frequently seen JVC model being sold in stores these days.I do not recommend it."
1497,"This is a terrible product - Apple should be ashamed of itself for allowing anything as cheesy as this part to remain in production.  I've been through two of these adapters.  As many reviewers have previously mentioned, my first adapter broke because of the inexcusably thin wire and flimsy connector that plugs into the laptop.  The second Apple adapter I purchased just internally combusted,made a popping sound and quit working one day after three months of casual use.  This product is so poor that it puts the entire Apple laptop product line in a poor light.  Even though I am a big fan of OS X, I would have to think long and hard before buying more apple hardware."
1498,"Didn't buy these on amazon, but had to come and pay my respects. I noticed after buying these that a lot of radio programs would use these headphones."
1499,"Save yourself the money and effort, buy a generic USB 2.0 reader from one of the major manufacturers for half the price."
1500,"Overview:I bought this camera from Amazon about couple of months back and have taken thousands of photographs with it. I like the convenience of using a digital camera and the fun and instant gratification from viewing a slideshow on my Apple Powerbook immediate after returning from a trip!Things I liked:S50 looks cool and with the black metallic body is a piece of art. Its relatively small in size and the fit and finish is great. The camera has a LOT of features and very easy to use and learn.  The best part of the camera is that it takes GREAT macro pictures and human portraits in close-ups. It can be as good or even better than my &Eacute;lan 7 with 28-90 lenses in that area.Things I disliked:But the biggest problem is that it doesn't take great pictures! In auto mode the pictures are not very sharp and the color are not so vivid like Nikon's. The exposure compensation is terrible and rarely will it take a correct exposure in difficult lighting conditions. Pretty much I can't use the Auto mode/s to take good pictures. I have to adjust the exposure setting and the shutter speed to get good pictures.  So this camera is really the digital equivalent of a point-and-shoot zoom camera like my Canon Sure Shot 115 but costing thrice as much!!!Other minor shortcomings are:The LCD screen can't be covered, the battery doesn't last for more than 100 shots and there is no handgrip to hold the camera. So you need a mini tripod as well!Further you can't add an external flash (the built is too bright for close-ups and too faint for big areas) or external lenses and macros or telephotos.Recommendation:I will strongly recommend you get the Canon G3 for much better performance for about the same price. Trust me, unless u want to blow up or print in 8""10"" you won't see any diff from 4 MP and 5 MPI don't knwo why ppl are giving great reviews about S50. Either they are not as particular as i am or maybe my model has some issues. I will soon sell my S50 in eBay to get the Nikon 5400 when the price drops !"
1501,"I like this mic, tried it out while playing games the other day and people said it was clear. The mute button is pretty cool, and the button lights up green so you know when you are on. Seemed to pick up pretty well during a pretty chaotic game. No complaints other than my playback from skype seemed a bit more bandwidth limited than i would have liked, but that was probably skype deign it for transmission speed reasons.EDIT: I now think this mic is horrible. I have bought a webcam to replace it, and realize that this picks up very little, and is hard to use. you basically have to have your mouth right on the diaphragm for it to pick up anything useable. Would not recommend."
1502,Helped a bit more over the usual phone cable you get with your modem or computer.  Speed went from 399 whatevers to 478 whatevers just with changing the cable out.
1503,"I purchased these after looking into the difference between these and the Sony mdr7506,  There is none except these do not have the gold plated jacks.  They sound great! I have many other sets of headphones and these are by far the best.  I thought the others where great until I heard stuff through the v6s. You will hear things in your music you never heard before.  They block out noise and are very comfortable on my big head, yet they fold down for easy travel."
1504,Haven't had it for all that long but it works as it is says on the packaging.  Great length.  Shipping and handling was more than the product itself.
1505,"Used this to build my first desktop computer.I clipped it to the ground pipe/gas pipe next to my work desk and never had a single shock.My house is very dry too, and this was a big concern.The bracelet was a little tough to get on right with one hand, but once it was on, the quick snap disconnect was awesome for every time I had to leave my desk to go get something. Handy to have around when doing stuff with sensitive electronics."
1506,"This product seems fine, but it didn't fit any of my 10.1W screens. Also, though these work, they considerably darken the screen, which means you're using maximum screen brightness all the time."
1507,If you don't have these headphones then you bought the wrong pair.Bose is nice these are nicer. Bose cost 299.00 these are under 50.00 and sound better.No they are not noise canceling. Yes they are more comfortable.Okay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome.  These are my third pair. I just wear them to death.They Rock the head!
1508,It is difficult to use this mouse with precision but it is much more comfortable than a regular mouse. My sore wrist did not hurt anymore using this mouse. The only problem is it broke in a few days. I sent it back and have been unable to get a new one.
1509,"It's not a solid 5 star, BUT it still deserves it. At this price, the sound quality is wonderful. I did burn-in with an app on android, using pink noise. Before the burn-in, the sound is good but not smooth enough. Now it just sounds right. The sound is much smoother. Good build quality. Nicely packaged. A decent leather bag is included.Now the CONS or insufficiency:1. don't expect light weight but it is ok;2. cable is ""telephone wire"", maybe good for moving around in studio, but ugly and unnecessary for other use;3. the can doesn't hug your head tightly. It is comfy for home use but you probably can't go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail.Overall, a great quality headphone for the price. Try it with flac/ape against other can, you will feel the great sound quality."
1510,"I use this tape with a DYMO LETRA TAG.  The print looks good.  I have not had any problems with ink smearing or anything.  The label looks when it is cut from the label machine.  Although, the paper backing is extremely hard to remove.  The backing needs to be perforated or something to make it easier to apply a label."
1511,"Tamrac's 5606 camera bag is well constructed, sturdy and versatile, and is suitable for use with either film or digital SLR cameras.  It is a mid-sized bag, designed to carry up to two camera bodies.  The crucial issue with this type of bag, is whether it has adequate space to carry exactly what you need, including lenses and larger accessories like flash units and battery packs.  Check Tamrac's website, and look at the diagrams showing the interior compartments of the bag, and how components may be stored, and judge if there's enough space for the particular gear you have.The interior of the bag can be divided into up to six smaller compartments.  The layout is designed to accept a body with a zoom lens up to around 8 inches in length attached.  While a camera with a long lens will fit in the bag, you'll have arrange things carefully if you want to carry too much else.  Also this setup does not work well if you have a battery grip attached.  One solution is to store the camera and grip with no lens attached.  Doing this, there is more than adequate space for the body, and three or four lens, and a flash unit.  Stored vertically, a long lens can be accommodated with no problem.  Carrying your gear this way, you're not immediately prepared to shoot, as you must take a few moments to assemble the camera.Though the bag is really better suited to accommodating the gear to fully outfit one camera.  In a pinch, the 5606 can accommodate two camera bodies, even with battery packs, but that will leave just about a third of the available space for lenses and a flash.There is a zippered fold down compartment with pockets in the front.  It would be nice if the pockets had some kind of fasteners.  Pouches with velco fasteners are on the side of the bag.  Velcro is an extremely poor design choice.  One should not risk putting valuable or heavy items into these pouches.  They could easily be lost, or fall out and be broken, should the fasteners fail to hold.  This wasted storage space is the bag's major flaw.  Some type of modification would be required to make them truly useful.The 5606 has an excellent heavy duty carrying strap, and also has straps at the base for carrying a tripod.  A semi useful feature is a wallet for carrying digital media and other small accessories.  The wallet is attached to the bag with an elastic strip, and sides into a compartment on the side of the bag.  The padding in bottom and sides could stand to be a bit thicker, but that can be said of most bags.As with any camera bag, it's ultimate usefulness depends on the user, and the particular gear to be carried.  The 5606 isn't quite perfect in all situations, but it is adaptable enough to be useful most of the time.  Available in several colors."
1512,"I bought this on the basis of the top review here, and am sorry I did. The unit pulls so hard it has torn several tapes right off the spools, and seldom opens by itself once the tape is rewound -- the motor keeps hauling away at a fully rewound tape.  It often balks at loading cassettes and balks at releasing them; numerous time I've had to pry my tapes out of it with a screwdriver.  Not once has the cleaning button stayed down, so this feature is as good as absent.  I finally put the infernal thing in the garbage, where it belongs."
1513,This amplifier has enhanced the signal quality of my television but the TV still blinks off sometimes.  The antennae has a fairly short cable so I thought I wouldn't not continue to have reception issues after this purchase.  Too bad.
1514,"I wish I had paid attention to the one review titled ""When 12 feet is more like 4 feet"" -- that sums it up perfectly. It does NOT feel like 12 feet at all. Or even half that length. The only way you could get 12 feet out of this is if you stretched it to the point where it's completely straight, and no longer curls. That said, the sound quality is great."
1515,"I like it because people on the bus do not pick on my stuff... kind of annoying. But the way it holds on your screen is not the best, and a little bit messy. Some time it come off. But still like it...."
1516,"Worked great for a while, but then burned out as is the issue with most of the other 615N. Pay a little more for 620N and you wont regreat it."
1517,"These certainly work well in myOlympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, and last a lot longer than alkaline batteries, but I only got about 300 images, and a few short (3 minute) movies out of one battery.  And if I did a lot of optical zooming, the camera would slow down for a bit until it rested.  When the first battery in the 2 pack died, I put in a new one.  I've taken around 30 photos on the new battery, and then I checked the voltage on it compared to the one I hadn't used yet:  2.928 volts for the ""dead"" one, and 2.967 on the new one.  Pretty close!I just got the2 NEW Lithium-Ion BATTERY & CHARGER For KODAK CR-V3 CRV3 C743 / DX4530 / DX6330 / DX6340set and couldn't be more pleased; 2 rechargeable batteries and charger, and for about the same price as this 2 pack!"
1518,Basically a good product I would have like more juice per channel to power USB 2.5 inch external drives  for lap tops.
1519,"These headphones are an amazing value and very well designed. The headphones are small, yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head. There is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted. The drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple, ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears.The sound is superb, especially considering the size of the phones. The bass extension is very good and satisfying, much better than comparably sized phones. The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are ""open"" or ""closed"" design. A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments. Open headphones, like the Koss PortaPros, are designed for use in quiet environments. So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane, these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty. I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now. I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out. I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge(see their website for details), and they promptly refurbished my headphones, and even put on new pads to replace my old pads! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones. So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use, the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small, open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100, which delivers similar performance, though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range; the typical Sennheiser sound. Both are excellent values but in my mind, the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal."
1520,"I've had this printer for about 2 years.  It was quite nice at the beginning but then the ugly side of it showed up after a few months.  Don't believe the reviews of ""new"" owners - take a look at these important points from someone who's had it awhile:(1) If you run out of either the black and white cartridge or the color cartridge, nothing will work.  Explain to me why you need ink in order for the printer to scan?!?  Yes, I was severely agitated on my trip to buy a new cartridge before I could scan my expense report for work.  No doubt I was just lining the pockets of Kodak that day.(2) There is no printer monitoring built in.  If you want to know how many pages that you printed since your last cartridge, you had better put a manual clicker next to the printer.  Why would Kodak not put the ""proof into the pudding"" by showing you how little ink it uses?  Simple - because the savings aren't really there.(3) The wireless worked fine when I got it, but then I had to regularly uninstall and re-install the print drivers so the printer can find the computers on my network.  I replaced the router, and I was still having this issue with 3 PCs.  Ridiculous.  I finally plugged the thing directly to my router with a cable to fix this.  Don't count on wireless to work.I hope you have better luck with this thing.  If I could still return it, I would."
1521,Not much to say.  It's a cable.  Works just fine.  All Firewire cables are pretty much the same.  This on is nice and cheap (especially if you have Amazon Prime to give free shipping).
1522,First off these Headphones have the same sound Technology as the Sony Professional Headphones!  The only difference is that these have a DJ style.  I also enjoy the slinky/coil type of cord.  I enjoy the headphones very much!
1523,"Instead of using your nice clear landline connection, make and take calls on a broken cell phone from the bottom of a sealed mineshaft. It will still sound better than your phone will sound with these things on it.I don't know what phones these designers have, but unless you have a handset from the late 1980's, these won't fit properly so that connections will sporadically come and go. You and your caller will still be &#34;connected&#34; but whether you can hear or be heard seems random.On other words, this particular &#34;cure&#34; is worse than the disease. Save your money and buy a headset or something."
1524,"I have an S100 in it, and it fits very snugly. There is room for an extra memory card and that's all. I like it, but I would have made it just a little less of a squeeze."
1525,"I've had it for 8 months now.  My biggest complaint: lousy reception for all but a few stations which are very strong.  It has no built in antenna. Wow! They saved a tenth of a cent of aluminum. A great saving for them -with the trade-off being a radio that can't receive stations.Instead, it requires use of a pair of headphones, or a little plug in wire that you can lose in about five minutes, to act as an antenna.  Stations that my car or home stereo can pick up with ease are filled with static, drift in and out, or have bleed thru from other stations which are not that close on the dial.  Even at the gym, where the tv's are broadcasting on their own little FM station from a handful of feet away, and the radio is stationary on the treadmill, the station can be filled with static and drift in and out.  WIthout headphones or the losable wire, there's nothing but static.No battery meter either, so it just dies very suddenly.  With a pair of NiMH batteries I get maybe 8-10 hours, which is okay, but nothing great.Button controls are a little confusing, not well labeled, and clunky wading through all the station pre-sets in a serial manner.Can't see myself buying another one of these when this one bites the dust."
1526,"Belkin has long been the affordable alternative for more expensive accessories.  I suppose there are many ways to mess up a cable, but Belkin hasn't.  Completely acceptable."
1527,"This was my 1st hub I purchase for mining Bitcoin.  It was soon discovered that this hub did not work for me as I would have intermittent issues with my USB Asic Erupters.  After a few hours of hashing away, they would generate hardware errors and ultimately, stop mining (indicated with a solid green LED light on the erupted).  I decided to purchase x2 10 port USB hubs as recommended by a lot of users in forums.  The 1st hub was a 10 port USB 3.0 ANKER hub and the 2nd was a 10 port USB 2.0 ROSEWILL hub.  Both work great and haven't given my any issues at all.  As a matter of fact, they have been running for about 2 months non-stop."
1528,"I was looking for a lens to eliminate the need for extension tubes. While I don't think this will totally eliminate using them, it is looking pretty good for eliminating them most of the time. The brokeh is excellent. I posted 3 quick shots to represent the quality of the image. I was also surprised by the heft of this lens. You definitely know it is on the camera body (using an EOS T2i) and for shots that take time to get just right you will probably want to use a mono or tripod as the weight of the lens will affect shots that take any amount of time to set. Make sure to use the distance setting on the side of the lens next to the AF setting as this will speed focusing on longer range shots."
1529,"I really like the low profile of these mounts, but I have found they do not hold well to finished particle or glue board, which is what a lot of desks and tables are made of on the underside. About half of them that I placed had come unstuck after just a couple of days. I have not tried it, but maybe they stick better to painted metal or plastics."
1530,"I've also got a Creative Nomad, and the HipZip player [is better].  I've been eyeing [another product] for a while, but the price on the HipZip pretty much blew that out of the water ....Pros: -The HipZip has fairly inexpensive media -The display is easy to read and shows everything you need at once -Well organized button placement -Ease of swapping media.... -Ease of transferring files of ANY type to media (does not store the OS on the media,... so you can fill it completely) -Full compatability with other Clik/PocketZip drives -Longer battery life.... -The software is minimal and painless (Iomega's sw is all-in-one) -It came with an AC adaptor (not a separate cradle) and you can get the car adaptor for only $10 from Iomega which is great for road tripsCons/Wishlist: -I REALLY miss the radio from my Nomad -Since the display is so large, it should have a clock -It could probably be a little smaller -The 40mb size of each disk is a bit limiting, but I've read that the PocketZip disks will be available in 100mb some time this year (anyone else heard this?)Some people have complained of the noise... It makes the same whir-and-click noise that my old Zip drive made, but it's not nearly as loud.  If you're listening to music with the headphones, you wouldn't really hear it unless you had the player right up to your ear.  It also has some memory built in as a buffer.  I haven't been able to find out how much, but it will read the disk and throw it into the buffer so it isn't constantly reading the disk."
1531,This cable failed almost immediately.  You have to wiggle and balance it in order for it to work properly.  Lots of static and L & R both stop working intermittently.I do not recommend this product.
1532,Five of the 50 cases arrived broken.  The packaging (air bags) did not prevent the contents from rattling around and damaging several cases.  The remain cases are fine.
1533,"I have the MDR-150's and these have the exact same sound quality. I have bought several different brands in various price ranges (all the way up to $100), and these are the best bang for the buck. I don't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced. The only problem with these Sony's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears. Would buy these again if they last a few years."
1534,"It's unfortunate that these are being discontinued (if they haven't been already) because these are AWESOME.  I have long since let mine go, but I regret it everyday.  I recently got some skullcrushers and I think they're okay, for the price, but man.. I really wish I still had these.  I have to say though, some of these prices are kinda outrageous, but they hold up really well, so a gently used one is a very good option.  Good luck, and keep on the beat!"
1535,"I was super happy when I first received these headphones.  The quality of the construction is great!  For the price of the headphones, you are getting a steal!It comes with a 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; adapter, and all contacts are gold-plated.  The headphones can fold in for easier storage, and the cable is super long, just in case you use it to listen on a sofa(away from your stereo system).I am happy on making this purchase for this headphones, and I am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound quality."
1536,"I bought this since we get such spotty unreliable speeds from our way oversubscribed DSL provider (name begins with cent....) and I've tried all sorts of attempts to remedy any problems on our end, including purchasing this. Kind of like hungryman, I'm OCD on trying to make a mediocre situation better. No idea if it improves anything on my end -- just can't tell, but looks great.Again: the BIGGEST problem is both CONNECTORS -- extremely difficult to unplug from anything anytime. If you have weakness in hands or fingers, you might have problems getting out.Otherwise a cool designed/gorgeous looking cable!"
1537,"Bought my first headset by Koss (KTX/PRO) Titanium at least 8, maybe 10 years ago.  Got it at a drugstore for about $15.  It finally failed a week ago.  Not completely, just wore out foam ear covers and developed a spotty wiring problem.  I was faced with replacing the best headset a picky, PICKY audiophile like me could find.  I spent a lot of time reading reviews and bought this one.  And BOY am I a happy camper!  Don't waste anymore time.  Get this headset.  Rich, deep base, clarity, no distortion of sounds in background.  I cannot imagine a headset that could sound better than this one.  It's extremely comfortable.  The wiring is a lot thinner and I may worry about damaging it.  Only disappointment was the ""case"" included.  It's not a case but rather a black bag made of a synthetic material.  I folded the headset to try to use the bag and stopped.  I don't want to cram like crazy and damage the headset to get it in the little bag.  I'll use the bag for other electronic gadgets. My old reliable Koss headset came with a volume control, and this one is missing that dandy feature.  That's the ONLY thing it's missing."
1538,"I bought this small AM/FM radio to listen to the local baseball game when at work and on the bus. But when I recieved the product the AM stations would not come in when I was downtown on the 5th floor of a skyscraper.I have no idea why this radio will get signal at my house 15 miles from downtown, but once I am downtown it has nothing coming in. I am thinking about returning this and getting something more powerful.After a few more days: This radio has almost no power, it constantly fades in and out and doesn't hold a strong signal on fm and am is barely their at all if you are lucky. It also picks up a lot of other interference from Bus engines and computers that it is located by.Please listen and do not buy this product, you will be just as sad as me :("
1539,"I bought this because my husband said we needed one. I just can't figure out when I need to use it. I like Tiffen lens so I know I will like this one, I just have to get use to it."
1540,"I just got a two-pack from buy.com for cheap. They didn't come with the windy case, but they are genuine. I have a pair of genuine 7-year-old mx500's for comparison and they sound the same if not better. The treble is amazing as I am sitting here listening to AYNIN by the Durans. I am hearing things that I do not normally hear. They are a bit uncomfortable as all buds are to my ears after a while. But for the price of a large fry, check them out. You do have to boost the bass a bit. (It probably doesn't hurt that I have a Cowon D2+ and a Sansa Clip. Remember, you have to feed it with something good to get good out of it(AKA not an Ipod-yes I own one))."
1541,"All you need right in one place.  Great.  Will keep this information for any further computer related purchases, also electronic help."
1542,"I've been using these for years.  Excellent sound quality for the price -- far, far better than other portable headphones I've tried.  Excellent midrange and treble clarity, with pretty accurate bass.  A lot of cheap headphones in this price range have horrible, boomy bass.  Not these.  Sound quality degrades a bit at extremely high volume; if you want to listen to music THAT loudly, get earbuds instead.Can be worn with the band either over-the-top or flipped back in a wraparound configuration.  (This looks a little goofy, but does hold the headphones in place just fine.)  If you don't like the looks, the ""PortaPro"" model has the exact same drivers.The only real problem I've had is that after a while, the little foam pieces that help hold the headphones in place can tear off, and they're not easily replaceable.  KOSS has a lifetime warranty and will replace them under RMA, but it's a bit of a pain shipping them back."
1543,"hey, is it just me, or are those little rubber plugs on the headphones infuriatingly easy to lose?they are constantly falling off, everytime i try to retrieve them from my often crowded bag to listen to my ipod. More then once, i find myself frantically checking my bag and the floor around me as i find that they've fallen off again.now, finally... i've lost them both. i have no more plugs. sony store doesn't have any replacements and gave me a parts number to call. yeah, like that would be cheap.so, an otherwise perfecly functioning headphone set going to waste.I can't be the only one that has this problem, can i?oh, they sound ok enough. the performance for the price is pretty decent. I just wish there was some way to deal with the lost rubber tips."
1544,"got the original portapros back in the early 80s and been using the successive variants ever since.  nothing beats these for performance vs. value.  I'm a picky listener (mostly classical) and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the 1960s but these little headphones from Koss have been great ever since the type was introduced.  get some, you will be pleased."
1545,"There is really not a whole lot of positive I can say about this thing. It works as it should, the cord is long, and the price is good. That's about all the good I can think of. It fulfills its life as a surge protector. However, there is nothing great about this product. It is way too fat and the cord is too thick and unwieldy. Not good qualities for a surge protector that is going to be out in the open. The plug is a standard plug, not a flat one (why do they still do that). Combine that with a thick cord and it becomes very hard to have it be plugged into a tough to access outlet. Also, all but one of the outlets are right next to each other, so do not think about using it for something that has big bulky plugs.Would I buy it again... no. I would pay a tad bit more and get something that is much more useful."
1546,"These are the most bass heavy headphones I've ever used, and I've used and owned a lot of high end headphones, including Grado up to SR-225, Sennheiser, HD-535, HD-570, HD-580, HD-595, HD-600, and a high end Denon of which I can't remember the model number.For a bass enthusiast this set is what I'd recommend - Sony MDR-V700DJThey aren't as clear at the higher end Sennheisers I've owned, but they are at least in the same ball park of quality (they aren't destroyed by the Sennheisers as far as clarity, but they do have much more bass than the Sennheisers. Sennheiser prides itself on making a flat EQ (meaning, typically not much bass.) If you're a bass hound just sick with these Sonys. I had a high end pair of Denon's too and they weren't as all around good as the Sony's in my opinon. With the 50mm drivers you can actually feel them vibrating on your head with a good bass lick --- I've never felt that with any pair of headphones.  They are quite comfortable too!Use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay. There are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison, but look like a very good counterfeit. Most negative reviews on these headphones have GOT to be from the chineese knockoff imitations sold new and used on ebay, because my set is over a year old now and work perfectly after being dropped a couple times even.  They are durable, and IMO of very high quality."
1547,"There are times where the router works fine for days at a time. Then all of a sudden there are phases in which it disconnects my connection every 5, 10, or 15 minutes at a time (I know because I check the clock every time it disconnects me). When such an episode happens, it lasts for a good few hours at a time, and im on my computer for hours a day so you can see how annoying and frustrating it can be when you have to reset your router every 10 minutes. (Connection issues happen frequently around once every week). I do not recommend for people who constantly use their wireless internet."
1548,"I asked an engineer that has done a ton of work w/ Dj Premier & w/ a ton of famous artists in rap & hiphop for a decently priced but still quality headphone back in 2010. He hit me back w/ a link to the MDR-V600 for $83.99 so i bought them. Now i see the price is over double that. I can definitely undertand why. They have a really great sound quality even at the 200 dollar price tag. The highs are crisp and the bass hits deep. I've used them soley for the past 3 years and wear them sometimes for up to 8 hours w/ very little discomfort & obviously taking breaks throughout. They are also extremely durable and made w/ heavy duty plastic, cordage & parts and can definitely take some hits and drops. The cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio. Considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal, but regardless they are some headphones i'll probably use for atleast 2 or 3 more years. I can certainly say these are some of the best headphones i've ever owned. Overall comfort, durability & superb sound quality made these the perfect pair for me."
1549,"The classic Sony MDR-CD6 headphones that I got back in 1988--held together with duct tape, string and super glue--finally fell apart after 24 years of use--and countless ear pad replacements. I used other brands and Sony models over the years and nothing came close to this--uncolored, accurate sound and especially its tight--not exaggerated--bass response. Until I discovered the MDR-V6, which I've heard has been around almost as long as the MDR-CD6. The only difference is that the MDR-V6 is more comfortable as it completely encloses my ears (the MDR-CD6 pads were smaller and rested on my ears, not around them). This is an excellent value for the money."
1550,Good camera for the price. The sweet spot for the fixed focal length lens appears to be about 5 feet. This is the perfect digital camera for a child or young adult - a much better choice than those &quot;disposable&quot; 35mm cameras.  Noticed some weird pixelation when the camera got closer to the subject (at or around 3 feet).  The colors sometimes get washed out by the flash.
1551,"We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program.Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!"
1552,"These are ugly as sin, but comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is excellent - so much better than the Sony's I replaced with these!"
1553,"Perhaps I got a bad one but I found this teleconverter completely useless. My equipment consisted of a Canon 60D and the latest Tamron 70-300mm telephoto lens with VC. I'm aware of the limitations as well as the probable need for manual focus. Unfortunately, no matter what settings I used, tripod or handheld with image stablization, or how well I focused the lens, this teleconverter could not produce a sharp picture. I went as far as taking a photo with just the lens and then taking the same exact photo with the teleconverter. NOTE: I took several photos to account for human error and took the best photo from each series. I then took each photo into Photoshop. I enlarged the lens-only image by 185% (2x is more like 1.85%) so that the subject was the same exact size. Even enlarged, the lens-only image was easily sharper than the teleconverter's image. So, in essence, this makes the teleconverter completely useless. Like I said, maybe I got a bad one but I can't recommend this item to anyone."
1554,"Maxell, your headphones are bad and you should feel bad.The sound is low. The sound is horrible. One of the headphones plays music at a much lower volume than the other headphone. I am ashamed that I bought these headphones."
1555,"I purchased these to replace an old pair of V600's that had served me well for nearly a decade, and the quality of sound out of these is as close to perfection as I've ever heard.  It has crisp, clear highs, and the bass is unbelievable.  I'm hearing bass notes that I've never heard before in a pair of headphones, and what's amazing is that the bass doesn't overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound.  I tested on my laptop and my iPod and set the EQ to flat on both, and the sound is near perfectly balanced: no muddy bass, weak midtones or tinny highs, just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experience.The phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear.  The padding on the cups is thinner than on past models, which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head, but they're every bit as comfortable as the older V600's that I replaced.  The headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player.  It comes with a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter so that you can plug it into full-size headphone jacks on stereos.  If you're going to use it on a home stereo, I'd recommend getting a 6-10' extension cord for it, unless of course you can sit close to your receiver.These are an incredible deal in my opinion.  I can't imagine much better sound at any price."
1556,"The first one that I received did not work out of the box. Amazon replaced it very quickly and the second one worked. The remote only works as you are facing the front of the camera and only from a distance of around 15 feet. If you plan to use this as a remote shutter release from behind the camera it will not work. It needs to to point to the receiver on the camera so anything that obstructs the path from the remote to the sensor on the camera results in no shutter release. I have purchased many Nikon products over the years and this does not live up to their reputation for quality and design. If I had known more about this, I would not have purcased it."
1557,It is very nice to have the ability to have these and use them when I need them.  Thanks alot!
1558,"Oh! for the days when one could buy a GOOD VCR.Transport (tape motion mechanism) is lousy, lacks features.  The ""Scan and Play"" concept is consumately stupid.  Very frustrating to use.But if you have hundreds of VHS tapes and all your good VCRs finally died of old age, it's better than nothing.A little bit."
1559,"After reading the all the glowing reviews for this adapter, I thought I couldn't go wrong.  Unfortunately, it's not working with my T-CL13.  I tried both a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, both Microsoft, and those worked, but I suspect they'd both work with a standard ""straight through"" type adapter as well."
1560,"This filter is okay. It didn't really WOW me by any means but it did work (although it can produce flares sometimes). The Nikon filter costs a lot more money than this so I'm still happy with it. And for anyone wondering, this fit perfectly on my 18-55mm kit lens that came with my D5200."
1561,"Fairly comfortable (I find most earbuds and in-ear 'phones difficult to take) with almost no noise isolation (you'll hear everything around you).  The little foam covers come popping off and are easily lost.  The little case is EXCELLENT and makes transporting these safely easy.  Overally, inexpensive, fairly good sounding, just the thing to carry in the computer bag..."
1562,"I have tried many other types of headphones, all more expensive, but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel. Lifetime warranty on these also. Can't go wrong!"
1563,"I am using this filter on my everyday carry lens. I previously had a Hoya Pro Multi-coat filter on this lens, but it broke. I wasn't excited about spending $175 on another 77mm CPL, so I gave the Tiffen a shot. While I don't have a quantitative set of comparisons between the two, my impression is the Tiffen is not capable producing the same results as the Hoya. But, the results are good enough. I'm taking candids of my family, high school sports, and vacation snapshots, not producing high art."
1564,"I was happy that I received the order quickly.  I didn't think to check the box right away.  I was in the middle of finishing a batch of CDs for a band that had recorded in my studio.  When I opened the box to insert the CD booklets and CDs, I found that I had been shipped regular CD jewel cases and not the slimline cases that I had ordered.  Since I was on a time table and didn't have time to send them back and get the right jewel cases, I had to make do.  Unfortunately, that included extra work for myself, since I now had to make tray cards for the jewel cases.  My fault for not checking, but how do you mistake the slim line cases for regular jewel cases in packing them for shipping?  That's why I'm giving 3 stars."
1565,The tripod broke within minutes of taking it out of the box. The telescoping geared part of the tripod extended it but the gears got stuck and now they just grind when I try to roll it down. A poor design and it seems to be made out of cheap plastic from the sound of the grinding gears. The gear also seems to be at an awkward angle. I'm not sure how I'm even going to return this product because the extended tripod no longer fits in the box. What a pain.
1566,"This camera really had all of the potential in the world, but sadly, it hasn't lived up to my expectationsYes, when done under daylight, the pictures are beautiful ---- but the indoor and nighttime performance is what disappoints meThe flash is WAY TOO STRONG, thus overblowing many of the nighttime shotsIn addition, I often set my own aperatures with this camera, but in having a mind of its own, the camera will re-adjust the aperture, right as I take the shotughI love Sony products - but I recommend staying away from this one"
1567,"At first these batteries hold a charge well. After a few recharges they are worthless. I own 8 of them and they are constantly being recharged. I take an average of 50 pictures daily and the batteries go dead after only 5 or 6 pictures. I won't buy another camera that uses this battery. Very very expensive, too. I paid about $30 or more for each battery. The retail price is $66 which is a joke. No battery should cost so much and be worthless after just a few months of recharging. I have had several begin to bulge at the center, too.One 6 second movie and it's dead.Thumbs down on this one.By the way, I do take very beautiful pics with my Olympus C-765 Ultra Zoom when I can get the battery to not go dead so soon.So disappointed.Wouldn't you know!! Made in China."
1568,"It performs v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y !!!Unfortunately this negative feedback is coming from someone who really likes Iomega products. I've had their Zip products for years, really like their Zip USB 1.1 250MB drive and the 128MB USB 1.1 Mini Drive, both acquired recently, yet this one is going back.The problem, I'm pretty sure, is WINXP SP1's support for USB 2.0 disk devices when attached to USB 2.0 ports. Other combinations perform well. I have written several articles on USB 2.0 mini drive products here on Amazon giving those products great reviews, but NOT until I formatted those devices as &quot;NTFS&quot;.There's something about FAT and FAT32 formats that's in conflict with WINXP.Nonetheless, I was optimistic about buying the ZIP 750 because I figured that if it runs slow like the 2.0 mini-drives, I'll just format it as &quot;NTFS&quot;. However, six hours after buying it, it was back in its box; I had given up in frustration.My benchmark was a web site that weighed 120MB, containing 2899 files. No point starting small given my experience with USB 2.0 mini-drives. Well, it took 10.5 minutes, which was an awfully long time for a 2.0 device on 2.0 ports on a fast Pentium 4. So, I tried to format it as &quot;NTFS&quot; and Iomega's software didn't support anything but &quot;FAT&quot;. Not even &quot;FAT32&quot;. I saw articles on Iomega's web site indicating that they don't recommend &quot;NTFS&quot; for Zip products, yet they provide instructions on how to use WINXP to do the formatting instead of their own software. It's not point and click, folks ... but never mind, because once I formatted it as NTFS this benchmark ran in 12 mins 50 secs. 10MB a minute is not good!Before I packed it up to return it to OfficeMax, I ran this benchmark on my 5+ year old computer which has WIN98 and some seldom used USB 1.1 ports and it ran my benchmark on the Iomega 750 in 4 minutes or so, but not before hanging me twice. Not one to give up without a fight, I reinstalled my Iomega 250 USB 1.1 on the WINXP computer and the benchmark data ran at 4+ minutes. I was not at all surprised. By the way, since you asked, the benchmark ran in 1 min 25 secs on my PNY USB 2.0 Attache mini drive (NTFS, remember). Using that as a standard, the Iomega USB 750 should have run this benchmark in less than 2.5 mins ... if it did, I would have kept it.In summary, if your computer has WINXP SP1 and USB 2.0 ports, you are extremely likely to have the same miserable performance I've had. Please buy the product from a dealer who will take it back. And ... don't be beguiled by reviews that say it was really fast when they copied a single 120MB file in only 1.5 minutes or so. That might be true, but it's not the way we use computers.Thanks for your time."
1569,"I find earbuds to be very uncomfortable. These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice."
1570,"I listen to jazz so my comments are related to this type of music.  The MX-500's provide a very good sound when you set your iPod equilizer to ""flat"".  Most other settings result in a sound that is overly bright, not natural.  The MX-500 do not provide any relief from the sounds around you (unless you turn up the volume pretty high).  All that said, I do like the MX-500 better than the ear buds that came with my iPod.I bought the MX-400's also (one of those Amazon buy two and save deals).  These ear buds do not sound better than the ear buds that come standard with an iPod."
1571,Wonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time ( I used it for more than two hrs most of the time).  Clear and has great bass when turned up volume.  Highly recommend this item.
1572,"The headphones I just purchased replaced a faithful pair I've had now for 24 years. Now that I have the new pair I can definitely say that over the years, the old ones lost a lot of bass even though I've replaced the ear pads, and the new pair sounds like I remember the old ones sounding when they were new. All the bass is there, all the highs and definitely all the midrange. The musical detail is extraordinary. I count on these headphones to hear things up close and personal when I'm doing productions and have never found a pair that sounded anywhere near what I get from these. Glad I was still able to get a pair of these V6's. They're #1 in my book!"
1573,"A heard better sound quality in a pair of cheap Jetblue airline headphones!  ( unfortunately the Jetblue ones broke, that's why I need new headphones).  But the main problem is that the plastic frame sticks out beyond the ear pad, so the rigid plastic hurts my ears and the foam barely even touches my ears.  Painful to wear more than 5 minutes.  i returned them to Amazon."
1574,"We purchased a Linksys EG008W at the beginning of 2004; the fan was very noisy from the beginning, but workeded ok out of a remote basement closet. However, after six months, the fan failed altogether. Linksys RMA has been a disappointment--they claim they are &quot;backordered&quot; on replacement product. Sheesh.Although the product seemed to work as advertised, given the noisy fan and Linksys' impossibly slow RMA and poor warranty service, cannot recommend purchasing this product. AVOID"
1575,Two of the cases arrived broken. The packaging (air bags) did not prevent the contents from rattling around and damaging several cases. The rest of the cases are fine. The quality is not the best but it dos the job.
1576,"For a product designed for ""sports"" minded people, this radio doesn't seem to be designed sturdy enough to take that kind of usage.  It's lightweight, which in theory makes it easy to take along wherever you go.  And to this, it runs on two-AAA batteries, so we're not bogged down by the weight of the traditional AA batteries.  That in itself is a drawback.  The battery life just doesn't cut it. If you used this as an everyday item, you would certainly change batteries far more too often than you would like.  The battery life is also based on what you're listening to.  AM stations use less juice than FM or TV.Although the digital tuning and the option of assignging your favorite stations is nice, the drawback is that you have a certain timeframe between changing batteries, otherwise everything is wiped from memory, meaning you also have to reset the clock, too.I also find the reception is best either outdoors (the whole purpose of a sports radio) or places where there isn't any electronic equipment.  The radio is really suspectible to interference from all sorts of devices.  Otherwise you'll hear a lot of static and disrupted sounds.The TV tuner is also a good addition, but not very handy if you live in areas where reception is poor or even still, live in one of those places where all the major stations are carried on the UHF bandwith!  I'm also one of those types that have always found having weather channels on the radio a rather pointless addition.  For me, it never gets used -- I always get my weather from the local news station.  For others who really must know the weather wherever they go, it'll probably be an asset.Lastly, the headphones does its job, but I've found with the thin wires, it's always getting tangled or I'm accidentally flinging the headphones off while moving around."
1577,"Sound is intermittent. If they are jiggled just right some static remnants of signal do manage to come through. Very cheap cost but very cheaply made. It wasn't worth it to me to even return them, I just threw them away and will order something better. I will not buy cables from this company again."
1578,This extension worked very well. The narrowness of the cable and its coiling makes it more compact & easy to store.
1579,It gets no better reception than a twin lead dipole antenna but it looks better and allows more flexible placement.
1580,"Before you purchase this card (Sandisk 128MB SD) for your Toshiba PDAs (like I did), you should visit PDA discussion forums like Brighthand.com. There had been many instances where data lost occured because of incompatibility between the specific card and Toshiba PDAs (like my Toshiba E310). Sandisk tech support basically throws their hands up and say - &quot;they are not compatible with each other&quot;.If it works for you, make sure you keep your data backed up in case something does happen. But backing up data is something you should do regularly anyway. Good luck!"
1581,"I wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... I'm so glad I did. With the smaller sensor on my 30D, the 100mm is more like 150mm or so, so it's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. I've uploaded a few photos I've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. I thought the 17mm-85mm IS USM lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens, the kit lens might as well be from a DIY pinhole camera.My less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. When I'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower, there is a lot of shake. I can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud, so I have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and I miss some really cool shots.In addition to the lack of image stabilization, I am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. I wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only, so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time.I've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. The telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. I recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. I practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos I wanted, but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and I wanted to use natural light over flash.The lens is long and heavy for its range. With the addition of the battery pack grip, this lens added on is very weighty, so I may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. Once I add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit, my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions.It's tack-sharp, but it can be frustrating at times."
1582,"I purchased this machine a couple of months ago and have never had such lousy service.  After loading the machine I hit the ""shuffle"" button and the carousel stopped the shuffling process after the third song.  Customer service had me ship the unit to their service center in Laredo, Texas.  We received a ""refurbished"" unit back in the mail.  What a joke.  I reloaded all the disks for the second time and the same thing happened.  I heard a crunching sound and the shuffle mode did not work.  I had to ship the unit ""again"" to Texas and received the third unit. Same problem.  None of the three machines worked and they all have the same problem.  I personally do not think the people in the service center even look at the machines.  Sony used to be a quality product.  They obviously have all this crap made overseas and the work is all inferior.  The service is horrible!!!  This is an inferior product made by a fifth rate company that no longer cares about its products or customer service.  I will no longer purchase anything Sony.  It has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Companies like this should not be in business in America.  I rate this company and its miserable product a minus 100."
1583,"I bought this to extend the headphones that came with my iphone because I like to listen to music at work, but sometimes I need to walk away from my laptop and the cord isn't long enough so it will either come unplugged or i have to take them off. I really wanted an extension to prevent that from occurring, but I could barely get any sound out of this thing at all because it would cut off if it rotated the wrong way or if the male end of my headphones was too far in the female end of the extension. Very frustrating. Ended up trashing it because it wasn't worth sending back. Save your money."
1584,"My biggest problem is the SO keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at home.OK - second problem. Now I have a USB headset for skype/etc, and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling (I usually don't bring the USB headset - too fragile). So now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse. Generally I don't like the quality/reliability of bluetooth, but I may try again in the next few months."
1585,"After wearing them for 3 days I finally put them on trash (because they are not enough expensive to send em back). These headphones are for the very big ear persons only. They simply will not fit on any person who has small to middle size ear. They leak too much sound out. If you press them to your ear canal their sound is ok, but under normal wearing conditions you could not get the whole sound in your ear. The plastic used on this earphone is not soft, shapable and comfortable as well. This product has very big design problems."
1586,"Decided to replace Y audio with HDMI Cable, so really can't rate this product. I am sure anything Belkin would be a good choice."
1587,Nothing to write home to mother about. It does the job it's supposed to without the fanfare and high price.
1588,"I don't need much. I am not even going to use it for recording. Amazon has the correct info that recording is Mono. But it shows that it supports STEREO playback. I have old stereo tapes and stereo personal recordings that I just want to make stereo digital versions using a tape player. So I just wanted something small and cheap. This claimed to fit the bill. Well I get it in the mail and I notice it say ""EAR"" where it should say ""Headphones"". I remember in the past that meaning mono. So the first thing I do it open the manual and sure enough under the section labeled ""Playing a Tape"", it says ""If you plug in headphones to the EAR jack, you will get mono output from the left and right channels.""And sure enough, put in a stereo tape and it's mono mixed output with headphones! That is a HUGE selling point issue for me! If I had know it was Mono output only, I wouldn't have bought it, regardless of how cheap. I gave it 2 stars because Amazon lists that as ""I am not happy"" with it. Which is the case."
1589,"Dishonorable company. Worthless product. I will never trust CCrane or Sangean ever again, and you shouldn't either.I just threw this annoying waste of $150 in the trash 5 minutes ago. Of course, the LCD stopped working just after warranty ran out, that was years ago. My disgust at CCrane's non-response to their flimsy product has smoldered ever since. I used the radio occasionally, but you can feel yourself aging while you try to dial in blind. The backlight randomly goes on and off. The preset buttons will trigger buttons next to the one you're pushing, then fail to memorize the station you're on, requiring irreplaceable minutes to make another blind dial in.Tonight was the final straw. The weather-alert alarm woke my wife and I up at 2am for a freezing drizzle alert, even though I DID NOT have the weather alert button ACTIVATED (red). That's right, the damnable thing will now blatter out it's weather alarm beeps whether I want it to or not, like a thing possessed.I'm embarrassed to have been suckered into buying CCrane and Sangean's worthless radio. Do not trust CCrane to do anything except take your money to their bank and make you feel like a sucker when you call."
1590,"Not much to say here.  It works for me.  I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't feel as solid as it could but so far, so good."
1591,I purchased the Belkin Anti-Static strap to help me avoid static shock while working out on my treadmill. It took care of the problem and the strap material and connecting cable appear to be durable and made for the long haul. I am very pleased with my purchase.
1592,"I used this when I was changing the RAM on my Macbook Pro.  I tightened it around me and clipped it to something metal and there wasn't an ounce of static from me.  It was a little awkward having a bungy cord hanging from my wrist though.  That being said, it is better than having to use that hand to hold something metal the entire time.  Remember, a simple static shock can fry your motherboard, and so the small investment in this product is worth it if you will ever be repairing any electronics."
1593,"I bought these as a birthday present for my father, and he couldn't be happier with them!  He loves to listen to music at a crazy volume, and these protect his ears while muffling the sound for those of us working near him.  Plus, the cord is long enough so that he doesn't have to sit right next to the stereo, and he can move without fear of the bit being ripped out.  Can't recommend these highly enough, especially for the price!"
1594,"These have been, by far, the best headphones for running that I've come across. I've purchased several in-ear headphones, some designed for sports, and either the cord would transmit feedback when it would hit my body, or I was constantly fiddling with the buds staying in my ear canal. If you can get past the dork-factor of these Koss, they'll give you trouble-free runs. Also noteworthy, they sit on top of your ears, so you can still hear what is going on around you. I never really liked running with my ears in isolation from the rest of the world. Call it a safety factor, but I prefer to hear what is going on around me."
1595,"It does keep volume level but it also introduces problems.  It creates a high pitch whine, most noticeable when there is no input (ex - when program is paused) and is noisy in general.  I still use it, but wish that it was a little smarter."
1596,"Bought several years ago.  Had it in bedroom on side table.  Rarely used. (It still looks like it came out of box).  Alarm feature okay, sound was good.  Suddenly would NOT power up.  Called Crane, attendant advised to try this and that.  Still not powering up.  Only option, send it in for Repair, for a mere ($59) plus I pay the shipping to them.  Not happy camper here.  If Crane doesn't stand behind their products better, than business will not stand by them.  Save your money and buy a SONY.  Very unhappy."
1597,"Bought the router to ease life in 'big brothering' our network.  It arrived, set it up, and the option for it has disappeared!Called support - they hung up 2 seconds after I asked!  Guess he was tired of that question.  Got through again, another tech explained they'd had so many problems they discontinued it.  That would make this just like any other G router.Also, had problem connecting with WPA - needed to set authentication to the 3rd option (not the default)...think it was wpa-pskOther than that seems ok.  Setup was pretty easy with the wizard."
1598,Does not look like a real one. Make sure you know the size before you order it.
1599,"I have had these headphones for more almost 2 years now. I am no audiophile but I can hear my 128 kbps mp3 files far better on these headphones as compared to my Creative I-Trigue L3800 (2.1) speakers. And by ""light user"" I mean AT LEAST one hour of use everyday. Because these perform better than my desktop speakers I have them plugged in pretty much all the time. The extra long, single-sided cord is useful even for home use (though its really a lot sometimes!). And I dont need to set my mp3 player volume greater than 25% of max (iAudio X5) to get excellent sound.Yes I agree they are not built that solid. Even though mine are in great condition, you can still feel its mostly plastic. But I have traveled with these headphones and I have also fallen asleep wearing them. I have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cups/padding. Maybe I just got lucky!"
1600,"....but not much more. This is a handy little digicam with very limited capabilities, the best of which is its ability to function as a very adequate webcam, broadcasting at a standard Internet quality resolution of 640 x 480. As a camera for general photography, however, this is far from adequate for anything other than emailing images, posting pictures to websites or dropping pictures into reports. There is not enough resolution to make printable pics (even standard 4&quot; x 6&quot; will look grainy), and the lack of any kind of zoom limits its use further. It is easy to use, happily runs on a single AAA battery, has an adequate (but non-expandable) internal memory and attaches easily to your PC via any USB cable. If you're looking for an inexpensive webcam that just happens to offer easy pocketability in case you want to take it with you for some potential photo opportunity, you can hardly go wrong at this price. However, if you're really looking primarily for a camera (as opposed to a webcam), you'd be advised to look elsewhere."
1601,"Well I bought these 71's because of the sound quality I read about during the opinions.  I planned to use these for my MTB rides and around town.  Well when I got them they worked like a champ - at least for the first few months...then I noticed something happening to the wire's jacket near the buds - they were turning dirty and softer than the surrounding jacket further down the wire.A few weeks later the jacket was stretching and looks now like it wants to peel off the inner wire!That is the bad side of the earbuds from SONY.THe only good thing I can report is that the sound is the best for the price and they fit my small ear canal.  I have bought others and they do not fit as well than SONYs...but with this very major issue with the wiring jacket peeling away from the wiring, I am staying away from SONY.Going to try out the V-moda Bass Freq.  The cost is similar to the SONYs, I just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than Sony's."
1602,"This case is very well made and designed.  However, for the Canon S2 IS, the fit is too tight.  Yes, the eyepiece gets in the way from easily sliding in, and once it's in, there is absolutely no room to spare.  You need to use two hands to pry it back out.  Also, if you have the strap attached to the camera, too much effort is needed to shove everything into the bag.  An alternative I found is the Case Logic TBC4.  It is a pretty compact camera bag with an outside pocket and 2 outside mesh pockets.  Sears carries this bag for $14.99 and is a much better alternative for the Canon S2 IS.  I am rating the bag 5 stars because it is one of the better bags on the market, but as rated in association with the Canon S2, it only gets 2 stars."
1603,"These work great but are made to fit tight over the ears to keep out surrounding noise.  I gave them to my grandson and ordered myself some lighter ones for myself that I like much better.  These also have a strange bar and strap to keep them firmly in place, which would make them ideal for moving around a lot or bending over."
1604,What more can you say?  Blue Cat 5 cable terminated in two RJ-45s.  It works as expected and the price was right.
1605,"I got two of these which worked fine for one year. Shortly after, my network connections would fail and I had to repeatedly restart both of these switches to get the network working again. A month later, not even restarting the switches would help. Another case of the ""blinking lights of death."" I won't be purchasing Netgear stuff again."
1606,"I tried it with a KVM in a unit that has only one PS2 port and a KVM that wants 2. It would recognize either the keyboard or the mouse, never both. It's probably the fault of the KVM but perhaps manufacturers shouldn't imply that these are foolproof. They aren't."
1607,"As I was finding myself getting ready for a long couple of weeks of temporary duty in Guatemala and in need of a good set of headphones for a portable DVD player to watch movies while sitting in a tent, I went to the trusted brand name of Sony.  The Sony MDR-V300 Traditional Collapsible DJ Style Headphones fulfilled this requirement in the usual wonderful manner that Sony products so often do.As I lay in the tent watching movies with these outstanding headphones on, the audio tracks on the DVD's were played wonderfully, enhancing the movie watching experience to perfection, giving a theater style performance..  While these headphones do not drown out ambient noises completely as they're not advertised to do so, they do keep a majority of the ambient noises to a minimum making the experience that much better.For price and quality, one can hardly do better than to make the decision to purchase these outstanding headphones and I highly recommend them to any and all who find themselves in need of a good pair of headphones.  I expect to get several years of good use out of these headphones and have high confidence in the quality and high standard of performance in this, another outstanding Sony product!  {ssintrepid}"
1608,"Some of them only wrote once. I normally buy Memorex and they work well, not sure what happened with this batch."
1609,"This product sounds great. Control your PC from anywhere in your room!! Cool!! It even installed easily. But that's when the problems started. Programs just don't listen to the remote. I'll be listening to a song on itunes, and want to change it. I take the remote, point it at the reciever, press the button, the little activity light on the reiver lights up and....nothing happens. The song doesnt change, the cursor doesn't move, zippo. So i push the button again, this time it will work. Or maybe it doesn't, so you push it again, then five minutes latter, suddenly, the playlist skips twice.To make a long story short, this product is just plain unreliable. When it works, it is awsome. When it doesn't, there is no explanation. I think it is a great concept, that needs some serious refinement."
1610,"Works as aDdvertised- does a pretty decent job- might cut down just a bit on sharpness, but the lenses we have today are so sharp to begin with compared to lenses years ago, that it doesn't really matter much- plus using today's superior processign softwares allows us to get back any lost sharpness quitre nicely-"
1611,"You can't beat the price, but if you are plugging your computer into your home theater sound system, you will hear a noise that is a hum, at a lower volume than what I found after buying a better cable that is sheilded, for just a little more money.Pro-Techgroup Professional Grade 15 FT 3.5mm Stereo Male to 2RCA Male 22AWG Cable - Gold Plated Connectors"
1612,"I honestly only purchased this for my guide scope, I needed a diagonal to attach my auto guider to.  I would not recommend this for visual use or imaging.There isn't really anything wrong with it, but for visual use save your money and buy a better diagonal."
1613,"So I have been buying these sleeves for a few years now.  In the beginning they were great.  The last couple of orders though (and I tend to buy 8-10 boxes at a time), the quality is not there.What I mean here is that there is a little catch tab to hold the flap.  Not an overlay difficult thing to design in and make, yet for the last few orders now the half inch or so of available tab catching range only catches maybe 1/8&#34; of an inch of the flap, meaning it doesn't hold it... it pops out.  Such a simple thing, that they just can't seem to get right."
1614,"I wanted good headphones that we over/on ear with good balance of sound at a reasonable price and these headphones worked out perfect. I got these to listen to music and podcasts and found these handle the full range with out being too bass-y compared to Dre Beats or other high-end headphones. I have found that many high-end headphones bill themselves as such because they can produce a lot of bass, but end up sacrificing range and clarity. I wanted a pair of good headphones and were looking at some sets that were &#62;$150 and decided to take a shot at these.These work for all types of music which I have tried classical, hip-hop, rock and roll, and dub step.I used them at work and a couple of times at the gym with no issues in either arena. They will block out the background noise of the gym and the pads don't soak up sweat like other headphones I have ruined in the past.Two issues are the looks and the comfort. The looks are something you will get used to. I have found that these can get uncomfortable after wearing these for a couple of hoursProGreat soundGreat bassGreat rangeGreat priceConLooksComfort"
1615,"Still picture quality is equivalent to $10 disposable cameras from 1997.  Just remember that a 1 megapixel digital camera was $1000 in 1997.Still photos are 1248x960 and can be downloaded in Linux, but video can only be downloaded and decoded in Windows.  Not a big problem because it only records 30 seconds of video at 624x480 9fps.  Can be powered off USB or internal AAA batteries.  Has auto shutoff when running on batteries but stays on when powered by USB.Still photos are stored in flash.  Video is stored in SDRAM, so you need those AAA batteries to keep your videos from getting erased.Very flimsy, like all Chinese products.  Different icons on the LCD panel wink off if you squeeze the case.Not as small as it looks in the picture.  Really 1"" deep.  Very light, however."
1616,"I bought it ... hooked a seinheinser MKE-300 mike into it, and plugged it into a SONY TRV-33 camcorder ... and I can't hear much of a sound (very very very very weak sound) even at the max range of the audio channel.  Completely fails."
1617,"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;"
1618,"Enjoyed these for the brief period that they functioned -- after less than three months of gentle, once-a-week use, the right earbud quit.  The sound is good, and the styling okay -- but I only got about 15-20 hours of use from them!"
1619,Works as it should long enough to move or place where needed. I would reccommend it to anyone needing this type cable.
1620,"The one I have is a little more stylish; clear plastic for the cord, and clear/silver plastic on both ends.  Good quality, and I've been using it for a couple years now"
1621,"I was going to use this to replace a mix of modulators, splitters and amplifiers. In theory - great, in application - not so great. The result was snowy modulated channels and lots of interference on cable channels that would not clear even using a low pass filter."
1622,I got this filter but not use much anyways still like it it will help you some time.When you want to shoot in slow speed
1623,I purchased this item to go along with the Automotive computer from blogs stating the unit needed to connect to computer well not only did the unit come with own cable but this was not the correct hook up
1624,"Mine worked great for 14 months with my iMac, network and peripherals, then it died.  When it worked it was quiet and gave absolutely no problems.  HOWEVER, it suddenly died  in the 14th month of operation. A switch should last longer than that.  I suggest a D-Link product for longer use."
1625,"This is a very good cable signal splitter and it is easy to set up.  However, I learned yesterday from a Comcast Cable technician who came to fix a cable box that couldn't communicate that it passes too wide a frequency spectrum for Comcast Cable.Comcast only uses frequencies up to 1 GHZ for its video services.  The technician said that allowing signals up to 2.5 GHZ to pass through allowed interference to pass from one connected device to another.  That interference, as well as some incorrect cable connections in the house, turned out to be the reason why the Comcast HD cable box could not communicate properly with Comcast's servers (it couldn't get an IP address).  In any event,a good quality splitter that cuts off at 1GHZ is what one needs if Comcast is your cable provider."
1626,"I have had this keyboard for over 6 months and am very disappointed.  My first one simply stopped working.  Microsoft replaced it without a fight.  The second one  is  now having problems such as the space bar putting in two spaces instead of one.  This is a real hassle when you  realize how often you  use the space bar.  The range on  the bluetooth is limited and that causes some problems.  Sometime it doesn't work even though are only inches away.  The mouse is has the biggest problem with distance.  The keyboard seems to shut itself off if it isn't used for a few minutes.  Then you type and nothing happens for  about 20 keystrokes.  That is anoying and time consuming.  Finally, it took quite a while to get this to  work with  the built-in bluetooth transmitter for Dell.  It works but it  took hours to get it  working.  Who wants a bid Microsoft transmitter sticking  out of your computer when  you already bought a  computer with it built in?  The keyboard has lots of nice features but the downsides are simply too many.  I will be replacing this keyboard soon with something else, even if I  have to go back to  a wired model."
1627,"CIRCULAR POLARIZER:If you have ever owned a pair of Polarized sunglasses, then you now what this filter can do for your camera. By reducing reflections and stray light waves, this filter makes any scene that much clearer.You will see more vibrant colors in bright scenes, your skies will turn a deeper blue, and clouds POP right off the picture. Reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as metal or water.A polarizer works on a specified plain, meaning that the lens must be perpendicular to the direction of the main light source. As with sunglasses, they are parrallel to the ground, which works in most cases since the sun is normally above you.The key to using this filter is that it swivels. Looking through the view finder, turn the filter until the picture is clear and vibrant. You'll notice the image changing as you turn it. In this manner, you may even adjust the level of polarization.A great deal for a very valuable accessory. This filter works perfect, and compared to the higher priced filters, is a steal.----------------------------------------------UV FILTER:The UV Filter prevents haze and reduces bluish tint in photographs by reducing stray UV rays entering the lens. It also has the added benefit of protecting the lens and glass from scratches and accidental damage.There have been stories of photographers dropping their lens and the filter acts as a sort of impact absorber, shattering but leaving the lens unharmed. I would much prefer replacing the inexpensive filter, rather than a lens.In my experience with the Tiffen UV Filter, I have noticed an increased amount of lens flare and reflections over my slightly more expensive UV filters. If I were you, I'd put out the small amount of extra money for a better filter, preferably multi-coated to reduce glare.Enjoy!"
1628,"I bought this hoping to get more stations in our warehouse.  As it turns out, it did not help at all on most including the one that I can't get.  If anything, it does the same as the wire that came with the system.  A waste of money."
1629,"terrible sound, and a bad fit over the hear. the buds are bulbous. the cheap &lt;$10 sonys are way way better"
1630,"another positive review for this, surprising it's relatively cheap compared to other budget headphones. nothing more to add than what's already said, this one is definately one to add to your collection, even if this is the only one in your collection"
1631,these are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had! if there is a contender for the Port-a-Pros it's the Sport -a - Pros!!!!!! these headphones are GREAT and very versatile!!!!
1632,"Really nice pair of headphones (replacing an older set of Koss's, destroyed by my cat) - robust bass, etc.  Ear coverage good,  rugged cord.  Looks like a decent pair that should last a long time (cat permitting)."
1633,"We researched many head phones and decided on either Bose or Koss SportaPro Stereo Headphones. While shopping on ebay we found a pair of Bose at a reasonable price. We purchased them, but even though we paid immediately, the seller chose not to ship the product. We did recover our money, but in the meantime thought we would give the SportaPro a try. I never did get to compare the Bose with the PortaPro, but these head phones give an awesome sound. Not being an audiophile I simply enjoy a great sound. They work well with a Lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card, and the sound is much better than my Sony Rack system.When I use these headphones, the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced. Recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value. You don't really need to spend $200 when you can get a high quality unit like the Koss. Am buying some more of these for some Grand Kids."
1634,We tried several batteries and tried on several devices.We read the directions and followed them carefully.Being a name brand we assumed it would work but we never got it to do a thing.NOT ONE DEVICE EVEN OUR RCA TV WORKED WITH IT.It was so inexpensive it wasn't worth the time to return it.I so not recommend
1635,"I pretty much tried this device for a week, before opting for a more reliable option.This device is another wireless product that only works competently under low strain. What do I mean? Well, if you use this device in an un-encrypted network or a network that uses WEP, you should receive reasonable results. I used this to give a credit card terminal internet access, and due to this I was using WPA to secure the network. This device was extremely unreliable with WPA encryption - to the point of it being broken.Frequent disconnects, slow transfer rates... etc. Obviously this is not acceptable for a credit card machine, because if I'm charging a card and the WET54G decides not to connect, then I have to run the card again - annoying the customer.Anyway, as far as setup goes, this device performs like expected. It can be a little confusing to setup for those who are not particularly comfortable with networking technology (you will generally have to have the device connected via ethernet to your network, or a computer during setup, before connecting to the intended device) , but otherwise it works like advertised in that respect.As far as alternatives...The number one alternative would be the WRT54GL from Linksys. You might be thinking ""well that's a router"". And it is. But, with a custom firmware (DD-WRT) the WRT54GL can become one of the most reliable consumer level networking devices. And it has a bridging mode. So it is able to give you the same functionality of the WET54G, but also give you much more functionality if your situation ever changes.Now a fair amount of reviews recommended a bridge from Buffalo. I'm sure it's good, but the WRT54GL offers much more features and costs about $50. Yeah a device that does a ton more costs less...The only downside is that it is a little more than twice the size of the WET - but since it works, and works reliably, I don't care.On a final note, Amazon was great about refunding me on this device. Since this device was broken functionality wise, the refund process was no hassle at all.-Oh, one final thing. If I remember correctly the device was at revision 3.1, which is apparently the European model of the device. The only reason why this is relevant at all, is that when searching for firmware updates you will need to visit Linksys's European site."
1636,Purchased these to try and help dampen down the shakes when touching the focuser of my telescope. They help a little but not what I was hoping for. Ultimately I am just going to need a sturdier tripod. Very expensive for what they are.
1637,"This product does what is advertised just fine: it crimps wires. I didn't want to sped a lot of money because this is just for my own house where I needed to crimp a few cables. For this, it worked well. The cables work, and I haven't noticed any performance issues with the resulting plugs. It also has little wire strippers and the like so you don't really need any other tools to get the job done. However, the outer insulator stripper that is built into the crimper seems to cut the wires too short, whenever I used the preset length the wires did not extend all of the way into the plug. Luckily, the product never really claimed to strip the outer insulator, so for the overall value of the product it isn't too much of an issue.I would recommend this crimper for anyone doing a simple residential job, but having no experience with professional installations, I have no idea how this would hold up."
1638,"cable was nice. worked well for me for a long time. used it for XBOX connection, not a big game nerd so the speed was sufficient for me."
1639,"Ad a tough time getting the unit to be recognized on several computers. It you happen to have a computer that likes this reader, it works just fine. But some older computers never recognized this unit no matter what I tried. The SanDisk SDDR-95-A15 xD / SM Reader is a much better buy if you need to read Smartmedia"
1640,"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. I recently purchased a replacement pair, as my original set died after 6 years of intensive use. They were repeatedly abused, shoved in and out of my bag and under seats on airplanes and generally not treated very well. They have stood the test of time and really performed well.I am a designer and I wear headphones all day long at work so comfort is imperative. While these headphones are large, they are extremely comfortable and block out my obnoxious coworkers.While the earpads will wear away in time as they did with my old set, the comfort and quality is not compromised. I have purchased these as gifts for fellow music lovers and twice now for myself. I couldn't recommend them enough."
1641,"Home studio connections are the place where Hosa cables and adapters shine. period. I've never regretted buying Hosa products, and Amazon prices have been great for these kind of items. The state tax thing may give me pause, however. I live in one of those states."
1642,"I'm a whiz at the four-wire telephone-style tools similar to this.  But I just couldn't seem to get things to work properly when crimping new RJ45 cable ends.  The tool itself is well-made, so I suspect it's operator error."
1643,I've had other headphones around this price range in the past but they did not come close to how great this set of cans sound. I did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and I wasn't left hanging. The sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me. I'm not really into how the Beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but that's just me. If you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint : ) !! I once had bad headphones but now I hear !! Taking this to church.
1644,"Thinking Memorex will be of good quality and there would least chances of coasters, I bought 3 Spindles (30 CD-Rs each).. I have tried variety of Drives (I/O Magic, Mad Dog and Micro Advantage).. I have always used Roxio Media creator 7.. With the above combination, I have been successful in burning one out of 4 or 5 Discs.. Mostly I get Media Errors and Some weird errors.. The 4th or 5th CD that burns, takes atleast 5~7 Minutes..!! Funniest thing is, the Free after rebate CD-Rs burn past (2~2.5 Minutes and w/o No Errors absolutely) and perform beautifully..!!If you are thinking of storing and preserving, Precious Data/Video, Please go for TDK/Verbatim..!!"
1645,I bought these for astro photography. I haven't seen a huge difference but it helps calm down the vibration after being focused or touched.
1646,"I loved these headphones from the very first day. I can't say I ever really needed to use the band behind the head trick, but for the sonic quality they deliver, the warranty they offer, the flexibility to switch the headband position, and the price you pay for the deal, these deserve 6 stars!I own these since around 2000-2001 and I just recently started hearing some rattling in the right ear channel. No problem - sent them out to be repaired by KOSS, for a marginal cost of shipping they were returned to me with new membranes, a new cord, and new cushions, plus a thank you note!These beat a lot of other headphones I've owned.Plenty of kickin bass and pure crystal clear highs. good mids too.A word of caution: the headband is not for giant heads, but should fit just fine for most.Recommended."
1647,"Like most people, I've slowly converted most of my music collection over to FLAC and 320 mp3.  So, this CD player didn't get much action over the last few years, which should add to its lifespan, right?  Wrong.  It just plain died.  I had to take it apart to retrieve my 300 discs and then it went into the trash.  Ironically enough, I pulled an old Kenwood 5-disc changer out of the box it had been in for at least 6 years and it works like a charm.  Go figure."
1648,"My parents unfortunately bought this without consulting me first.I know a few people who buy these Kodak machines and they're DOA or simply didn't function well at all. This one makes weird noises, the paper jams constantly (the paper tray design makes it easy to push it in too far and then the printer tries to take 20 sheets of paper at once, choking to death on it).When this printer does work, it often whirrs for 2 minutes doing who-knows-what. Or, it spits the page out immediately. You just don't know.I have read consistently bad reviews for this line for over 2 years now. Great idea, but bad execution. I cannot believe Kodak still sells these things. They break within months, if not DOA out of the box. And Kodak sends you a refurb (which is even worse). You can't fix a bad design - it'll fail eventually. It's everything - the paper handling and the sensors are the main problem.I've found the Canon MP series to be quick and reliable, with 3rd party ink here on Amazon to be on par with the price of these Kodak inks, and the prints are better. I know because I've A-B'd them side to side.This Kodak is going to be returned ASAP."
1649,I purchased this lens primarily for use as a macro lens.  Since I shoot mostly wildlife (including bugs) I thought the field of view of 160mm (used with my Canon Rebel XT) would be just about ideal.  In reality the FL was not enough.  I had to approach the bugs much too close and they frequently left the scene quickly.  The pictures taken with the lens were extremely sharp and the bocah (out of focus area behind the subject) was very nice.  I wound up selling the lens on eBay since it didn't meet my needs.
1650,"We justified the purchase of a new DVD player so that we could play back our JPEG photo disks and also our multi-album 'favorites' of MP3/WMA music disks, none of which our three year old DVD player can handle.The Panasonic S55S was sent back within three days.I tried out some of my DVD-R disks (Memorex 4X and 'Pro-Line' 1X) along with CD-R disks (Memorex 48X 80 Min) and they all worked flawlessly.The reason for the return was two fold;1) No S-Video output; Until we upgrade our TV we have only analog or S-Video input available.  I used the enclosed analog video cable and got a really lousy picture.  Perhaps a better quality analog cable may have improved things, but I did not try one.  The picture quality was poor and was especially noticiable on still images such as titles, jpegs or the FBI warning screen.The DVD player had only nickel plated RCA-jack analog and component video outputs, plus right/left channel audio and a digital output.  No S-Video output was unacceptable.  I thought ALL units had that!2) Slow and jerky JPEG playback.  When a CD with a lot of JPEGS from our five megapixal digital camera was inserted (average file size around 850k), the picture was displayed and the option for slide show became available.  Unfortunately, it took several seconds (probably only about five each, but it seemed like 30) for the image to slowly appear on the screen as though it was downloading from an old 14.4k dial-up internet connection.  Combine this slow picture display with a very fuzzy image and the experience was just sad.The unit may have technically met spec's, but it was not realistically usable and was a big step backwards from connecting our laptop to the TV via S-Video and looking at pictures that way!Amazon took the unit back very easily. Kudos' to Amazon."
1651,"The URC 8910 Universal Remote Control works fine but working with the buttons is a pain, especially the power button. It is too easy to turn off the device you are working with. A bit on the heavy side as well but as a URC it serves its purpose."
1652,"I figured this item would help me get better reception but I can't really say, there is much of a difference. I would recommend you not buy this product."
1653,"After carefully studying the features, using them inside thestore, and viewing the pictures on one of their display PCs I washappiest with the high resolution photos that the FD-88 produced as well as it's special effect's capability. I also appreciated the lack of legacy adapters and wires. Its use of standard 3.5 floppies is great. You'll be hard pressed to find a computer without a floppy disk now or in the future.I worked up the courage to buy it, I've been using it for several months now, and I have NO regrets. A couple friends have some of the newer Kodak, AGFA, and Olympus models and they're all disappointed with theirs compared to the FD-88. The disk writes pretty fast and you can get usually 10 or 12 highest quality photos per disk.  Movie resolution is good for PC and Web use, but, its 15 sec or 60 sec recording limit can be a little limiting.  END"
1654,"I bought this for my headphones, but this cable didn't even work when it arrived, I now have to buy another..."
1655,"I had gotten these as an exchange from a set of headphones that cost twice as much. And while the sound quality is better than those headphones, these will be going back to the store as well.I have a relatively small head, so it wasn't crushing my head like other people have described. But the headband is incredibly uncomfortable, even after adjusting several times in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on top of my head. The ear pieces were just as uncomfortable.Get these only if you want great sound... by holding them to one ear like they are designed to do."
1656,"Going on a long flight or not near an outlet.  This is handy, for its price.  There are other recharges out there, but they cost double or triple the cost.  AA batteries are easy to come by, so that makes this a good product.  But turning it on is a chore.  You better have a key or nail file near by.  Sliding the switch on is a struggle.  And when you do not need it, turn it off, otherwise the batteries will drain.  It also does not snug completely to the 30GB.  If your iPod is low on batteries, this will work in a pinch.  But if the connection comes loose and the iPod batteries are low, the iPod will turn off without any notice.  Also, the suction cups are not needed.  Most people keep their iPods in some sort of protective barrier (plastic or rubber).  So the suction cups are a nuisance.If it snugged better and rested at the bottom (like the other rechargers) I would give it a 4, a 5 if it lasted longer."
1657,"What other reviewers have said about damage to your equipment is correct.As these cables come new, the RCA male connectors require far too much pressure to successfully connect with a standard RCA female jack. With that much pressure, you risk unseating the female RCA jack on your equipment, or damaging the jack beyond repair. This is without question a design flaw, not a ""feature"".To safely use these cables with your equipment, you must first modify them by widening the diameter of the outer conductor (ring) of RCA male connectors with a tool. That is unacceptable.I would return the cables, but I have already damaged my equipment, and risked damaging the cables trying to modify them.Thankfully, I can repair the equipment myself."
1658,"When I was much younger, like 18-20 I had a pair of Koss Headphones that I bought at a local music shop for like $15.  I've never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again.  They technically still work, but I broke the connection between the headphone and the head band.I've been using SennHeiser 201HD's at work for a few years now.  BUT the bass was never terribly pleasing.  I had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old Koss Headphones over Christmas.These things are amazing.  The base response blows the Sennheisers out of the water (and yes, I know they are twice as expensive) the comfort unbelievable.  I have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better (TO ME) than the 249.99 Beats they had on display.I gotta say, these things rock. Frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these."
1659,"I finished one 50-disc spindle of Memorex CD-Rs (50x/700/80) which all were burnable on my LaCie burner(Tsstcorp CDDVDW Sh-5223L) at a speeds of 21x-37x.  I still needed more copies, so I opened up this new spindle of 100 of these same discs both brand and kind.  Of eleven tries I had eleven duds:  nine had sector 0 unreadable upon verification (and wouldn't mount), one had sector 37xx unreadable on verification (and wouldn't mount) and another sector 4. I went through the spindle dropping down about 5-6 at a time, hoping to find a spot in the spindle where they become usable. Both the spindle that worked OK, and this dud 100 CD spindle were made in China.Decided to see if they would burn using my internal Macpro laptop burner (a Marshita DVD-R UJ-898).  I was able to burn 2 for 2 successfully at speeds of 11x-16x.  They were from the same levels on the spindle that would not burn on the LaCie.  I'm still giving them a 1 star because of their poor quality compared to the first (even older) pack of Memorex CD-Rs.Update:  I have continued to successfully burn 100% of these CDs using the 11x-16x speed of my internal drive."
1660,"After using a 100-pack of these with no problems, I did not hesitate to buy another. Sadly my experience with the second lot was very poor. I estimate that about 15% failed to burn. The failures normally occurred near the end of the burn, which corresponds to the outer edge of the disk. As a result I will not purchase this brand again, since it appears that they do not have good process control from one lot to another. Keep in mind that Amazon's return policy is not designed for items that you use up over time. Thirty days after purchase you are on your own."
1661,"I first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version, the MDR-7506, for more than 10 years as a professional field video producer. I bought the MDR-V600's for home use, and they look and sound new after 11 years of occasional use at home.These are an over-the-ear headphone, meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears, which means that your ears don't get sore. This also acoustically isolates you from your environment.  However, if you sweat heavily, they also tend to trap moisture.Sound reproduction is excellent and full-range, and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones, you will hear well and you won't hear much of what's going on around you outside the phones. They do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies, but that's something that most people don't mind.The screw-on 1/4"" tip screws off to reveal a 1/8"" stereo plug, so the phones work with most playback devices. I highly recommend them as durable, acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years."
1662,"This was awful.  Didn't last and the company didn't last either, which isn't surprising.  I forgot I even owned this thing since it didn't live for more than 3 months."
1663,"Anyone considering a Momad Zen or the new NX model should find a demo in store and play with it for *more than ten minute* before coming back and ordering it ...  The players are ugly and bulky and heavy, and iPod-killers?  In Creative Labs' dreams.  These don't hold a candle to iPod in any aspects.  In your hands it just feels cheap and ugly, not the kind of feeling you want to have with an expensive gadget you plan to use every day.  If you use it you'll find good sound quality is about the only virtue.  The interface is ridiculous, and file downloads is unnecessarily complicated.  Construction material and quality are third-world class, not the kind that gives you confidence.  Finally, even the store salesman said ""Don't ever jog with this!""  'Nuf said."
1664,I live in a apartment house with steel structure and am on the wrong side of the building for the stations I wish to receive
1665,"After reading all the great reviews, I thought I had found reasonably priced, good sounding small speakers for an extension of my stereo system to a second room.  All I can say about these speakers is, ""You can hear the box.""  Anyone who has heard speakers that are acoustically invisible will know what I mean.  These are definitely not in the premium quality category.  I guess for the price, I should not have expected so much."
1666,"OK, so when I built my machine in Oct, 2004 I bought 2 of these drives and never needed the 2nd one...never even formatted it. So a couple weeks ago my primary just dies with no warning...even Spinrite couldn't do anything with it after 2 weeks of running. So, at least I have the 2nd drive to use right? Wrong, the 2nd drive that was never used died too!!! My bad for installing the 2nd drive before I needed it, but I didn't realize that they spin constantly, whether being used or not. So 2 drives died at the exact same time?!?!? I'll never purchase another WD product."
1667,"Just because this cable is made by ""cables to go"" doesn't mean they are any better than cables that they include with most ipods/mp3 players. For the price you pay, you get nothing but a thin cheap wire. They dont make good connection, crackle when you touch where they are connected. They are so thin that they are prone to pick up interference. If you want something that is in this price range, but better quality go with Rite/AV. Even though the reviews aren't good for them, I never had any problems with them. They are cheaper then the cables to go, and they are much thicker. If you need something shielded and higher end for you car, then I suggest the higher end cables to go or the premium cables made by monoprice. The Monoprice cables are cheap and thick as a piece of rope.... The cables to go premium or middle end are good, but more expensive than the Monoprice. There is no reason I can give you to purchase these, espically when the Rite AV bottom end cables are cheaper and better quality (both thicker and make better connections) Save your money..these are not an upgrade to the cables that come with your electronic equipment."
1668,My dad had an old sony camera that I use sometimes and the memory capabilities leave something to be desired but oh well it was my dads...So I bought an extra memory card to have and it works great :)
1669,"The reach on this cable is great if you need the length. I use this cable to link a portable cooridinate positioning system and laptop computer. The length allows me to move the device around without having to move my laptop also. I would have givin it 5 stars if it were made of a more flexible rubber type material. The cable is made of a soft plastic like material which is very flexible in warm temperatures like 85F or higher but under cold conditions, the cable gets stiff and hard to uncoil making it more difficult to work with on job sites. Electrically the cable works great and fits USB sockets nice and snug. The lack of a California lead hazard warning in the item description is what led me to purchase this cable. Its nice to not have to wash hands after each time the cable is handled."
1670,Get the Tokina 12-24mm f/4 for half the price. It's rated sharper than the Nikon and built like a tank! The Nikon lens is plastic.
1671,"I'm a long time pro audio engineer. I buy lots of different headphones almost as a hobby. I have a pair of Etymotic 6i earbuds, the Sony 828s and now these Sennheisers. Although I record primarily jazz, I listen to alot of dance and hip hop. I believe the Etymotics and Sennheisers are pretty accurate and reflect the anemic bass output of the Ipod headphone amp. When I use the ""Classical"" EQ setting I get the kind of bass I like with these phones. Listening through my audio gear the bass-treble response is pretty true though. The Sonys don't require any bass boost on the Ipod but don't have the same liveliness on the treble side the others do. Have fun and experiment!"
1672,"There no other word to describe this camera. Don't go for its 3MP/3x tag, there are many others things which need to be good. For example picture quality, battery life, features, indoor pics, build quality are all bad.Anyways the camera isn't worth your money. Just 3MP doesn't mean good pics..."
1673,I bought this about two years ago and it was a great deal...or so I thought. I used it with a Canon XSi. It is very light (flimsy) but has great features for a cheap tripod. The main problem is that the metal screws on the adjustment pegs tear this thing to peices. If you slightly turn one too far it will split the plastic in half. Mine actually cracked (the first time)sometime during a move and setting it up. The next one I was responsible for. Just very cheaply made and thats what I expected for the money. If you can afford it step up to something that will last. Hope this helps!
1674,"It's actually terrible when there is light or a reflection on the screen. In other situations, it provides privacy quite well, the gold coating seems to add a level of privacy."
1675,"First off, these are well worth the $20 they cost, but the sound is nowhere near as good as 90% of the reviewers here say. The bass completely overwelms the sound, but most people *like* that. If you want more accurate sound or the ability to hear the highs and subtlety of music, you just can't get that with these. The only setting on an iPod that these sound the way they should is on Treble Boost--all the other settings allow the bass to overpower everything else.They are definitely worth $20 though and since most people want to hear fat bass, I would recommend them to any non-audiophile. I'm borrowing them from a coworker and she loves them and has two pair, but she also admits she has no idea what good sound IS.I have some $70 Audio-Technice ATH-M40fs headphones that render every detail of every sound recorded on a track. There is stuff in some music that you've never heard before because it is muddied up with all the bass. Don't get me wrong, M40s have plenty of bass, but only produces it when it is in the recording. But they are big and clunky, have a 12-foot cord and I don't want to bring them on the bus.I'm torn with these V150s, since they are small, cheap and have very listenable sound. But also for $20 you can get the Sennheiser HD220's which cover the entire ear and supposedly have better sound. I've just never heard them.Mainly I wanted to refute the claims that these are some of the best sounding headphones out there especially from some of the DJ's reviewing here. The sound is not that great and certainly not accurate. But you can definitely listen to them and you will get plenty of bass--even on the Bass Reducer setting on an iPod.For $20 you can't go wrong, though plenty of people said they break easily. They feel like that is true, so don't step on them or put them in your backpack and lean against a wall."
1676,"Pro:  It's cheap.Cons:  It didn't work and wasn't fully assembled on arrival.  It took 35 days to arrive.Edit:  I'm typing this on the SANOXY USB to PS/2 Adapter.  I pried it apart with nothing more than my fingernails.  Where the problem was immediately obvious, a wire was not soldered to the fingernail sized circuit board.  Pulling out my trusty soldering iron and attaching the needle tip, the board was properly soldered in 5 minutes.  Still rating as a 1-star since DIY (Do It Yourself) was not in the description."
1677,"I was excited by all the features offered in this unit for the price, but living with it has left me feeling otherwise.1. Weak weak weak remote.  Point directly, push repeatedly, and Maybe it'll work.  Buttons are tiny, not lit, etc2. Lowest volume TOO LOUD! How can a product be made like that?3. Amplifier dead after 3 months of light use.  I'm calling the company tomorrow, it's got a 1 year warranty, but I'm not hopeful.  Even if they ship a replacement, I don't think I want it!..."
1678,"these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff.  although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long.  As the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" but this is nothing less than false advertising."
1679,"I wanted a trackball to ease the pain in my wrist from mousing and remembered the excellent Kensington Expert Mouse that I used to use with my PowerMac 7500 years ago. That was a fantastic mouse. I had read the reviews here for and against this model and thought I would purchase it despite the preponderance of negative reviews.I wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews... this Expert Mouse works nowhere near as well as the old one. The build quality is cheap, there is no way this is a good value at $85 anymore. I would say a fair price would be about $35.The old Expert Mouse had sealed ball bearings, this one has tiny glass beads that don't rotate and collect goop causing the ball to move as if it's in butter. I have tried cleaning the tiny beads with intermittent success. There is a scroll wheel that when moved sounds as if it's sliding over sand, and the buttons make a tremendous amount of noise.Kensington's software for Mac OS X is remedial. You will have to buy a shareware program to use all of the mouses buttons, etc. Figure that will cost another $20.I remember the old Expert Mouse, when I gave the ball a spin it would spin and the more it was used the better the ball spun, this one is nothing like that because the sealed ball bearings have been dropped from the design. That is the major flaw.I am sorry to say that I recommend against this mouse and I am on the hunt for another. If I could have seen it in a store first I would have never purchased it."
1680,"What an atrocity these discs are.  I have three different CD drives:* Plextor PX-755SA (f/w rev 1.07)* Plextor PX-716A  (f/w rev 1.11)* Toshiba SD-R1612 (f/w rev unknown)All discs were burnt on the PX-755SA.  One burn failed (could've just been a bad disc; it happens), so I'm excluding that from my opinion.  All burns were done at 16x (occasionally I'll use faster, but I prefer less re-reads when the discs are used).Out of 10 successful burns, 7 were readable by the PX-755SA, 3 were unreadable by all drives (including the PX-755SA).  Of the 7 which were readable, only ONE of those was readable by a drive other than PX-755SA.Before you say ""sounds like a Plextor problem"", consider this: I also use ""Memorex 700MB/80-Minute 48x CD-R Media (Black)"" discs purchased from Amazon.  I have yet to experience any problems with those discs.That said, I'm left to believe these discs suffer from major compatibility problems, completely unrelated to vendor.  It's possible I simply got a ""bad batch"", but the failure rate is completely unacceptable; it's wasted money, and wasted time.As someone in the IT industry, I need to be able to burn a disc at an acceptable speed (16x) and haul that disc to a co-location facility to install an operating system on a server.  I don't like burning a disc then driving 20 minutes, only to find the media itself has failed me.Avoid these particular Memorex discs."
1681,"I am actually a huge fan of Canon optics.  When I first started searching for a DV camcorder, I looked at Canons.  Then I realized that Canon does not know how to make a quality camcorder.  The ZR series (all of them) suffer from tremendously bad audio, and the MC200 is a worse model than the MC100.  Actually the MC100 was probably the best DV camera that Canon ever made, and it just so happens to be the one that is discontinued.  Since I am so fond of Canon photo equiptment, I wrote this review hoping that Canon would hear it's consumers cries, and fix thier awful camcorder problems.Do yourself a favor and stick with a Sony or Panasonic.  They each offer solid audio, video, and features."
1682,"There is something nasty about the driver for this camera.  On 2 different machines, the driver for this camera creates faults at shutdown--something about not releasing control and being forced to quit by Windows XP.  Install at your own peril.  NOT recommended."
1683,"These fit snugly and are reasonably comfortable for extended periods but the earpieces get sweaty and cumbersome during long workouts.  I was reasonably impressed with the bass compared to the other 3 or 4 on-the-ear headphones in this price range I've tried.  These are my backup pair when I can't find other headphones.  For times when I don't need sports headphones, I'll probably use buds.  For sports, the ones where the little speaker fits sideways into the ear seem to work better for me."
1684,"...and I have never found a superior pair of headphones, period.They are comfortable (with one small adjustment). They have fantastic sound. And for the price (almost always less than a hundred bucks, sometimes much less) even if they do fail or wear out (which they almost never do), they're easily replaced.I can't handle in-ear buds -- my canals are too small and they always hurt. On-ear headphones are a joke. These are perfection. That one small adjustment I mentioned? Get a pair of Beyerdynamic EDT 250 velour replacement pads and suddenly these headphones become the last pair you'll ever need."
1685,"I have been dissatisfied with the built in flash on my Digital rebel.  Bought this two weeks ago and have used it extensively.  The batteries last forever.  Main improvement is when using it as a bounce flash.  Much better colors, softer light, no redeye.  It can be used as a slave flash but only with the much more expensive 500 series.  The only reason I give it a 4 is that the new 430EX just came out with significantly improved functionality. However, the pricing is probably much higher than these closeout prices"
1686,"Pros: priceCons: slow, muddy bass, 60Hz hum at high volume setting with no muted audioWith over 700 mostly five star reviews and huge discount for discontinued product, I was sure I can't go wrong with PSW505. But I was. If you never had any sub before, this probably will meet your expectations as for less than $200 you get massive heavy well built cube able to shake your room well. But is it all what defines decent sub sound quality? Certainly not.First of all, this sub must have really poor amplifier/supply design as it produces audible hum with no signal being inputted. This 60Hz noise level follow the volume setting and is also affected by the length of connecting LF input RCA cable. Which tells me about poor design of the input circuit as well as power supply filtration including proper ground noise decoupling. This is not 70's or 80's anymore and any active subwoofer should be absolutely silent when no LF signal is fed. Period.Secondly, quick look at used woofer design might give a clue of why produces bass is slow and muddy comparing to similarly priced competitive products. Although driver is listed as 12 inch, the actual diaphragm diameter is little over 8 inches suspended on enormously wide surround suspension which for sure allow woofer to work with large displacement but it produces lots of distortion and may slow the bass reproduction which in case of PSW505 is clearly heard.Lastly, this is back vented subwoofer design. This means most of people may have hard time to position the sub in order to get deep unidirectional distributed bass. The vent port blows as the main drives blow directional so the bass intensity dramatically changes as you change listener position against it or rotate subwoofer on its axis sitting in fixed position. There are plenty budget subs around with bottom vent design and these are able to produce unidirectional bass which makes sub location flexible and allows entire floor to distribute lows, which makes a big difference in sound scene not only for watching action packed movies but when listening traditional stereo in 2.1 mode.With that said, I cannot recommend PSW505. My experience with this product seems to explain such heavily discount offered for already discontinued product which apparently performed below acceptable performance level which I define as minimum required for decent HT systems out there."
1687,It was cheap so I don't feel too bad.  It just doesn't fire consistently.  I have read all the reviews and I worked with it for a good while on several different occasions before coming to this conclusion.  When it works it's great.  Now I am just using the timer in the camera.
1688,"Hey if you are like me and need to have the printer a little further away from the PC then these are the cables to grab. they are 10 ft in length and still transfer the data between the printer and the PC without issue.Overall, these are great to have when you need a little extra room."
1689,"I got this mouse on sale over a year ago and it's workedflawlessly with two different Windows 98SE systems (connectedthrough the mouse port). I've had no problems with it atall. Smooth scrolling, decent with FPS games. All in allit's a good deal."
1690,"On one hand, these are cheap little routers.  They work most of the time.  However, I have now had 3 of these, and the first two have been very flaky -- dropping wireless pretty consistently.  I will say that it wasn't a problem to get it replaced under warranty, though.  I guess for a cheap unit like this, it's not worth their time to troubleshoot, they just send you a new one.  So I appreciated that.I've also noticed that the look/model of these changes rapidly.  I wonder if they are OEMing different models from manufacturers making ultra-cheap hardware.  I can't say I'm very impressed."
1691,"For the price, this router seems like a good value buy, especially if you don't need wireless (why have wireless if you don't use it?)  and with a rebate it's even a better deal.I would recommend it over Linksys however the user interface on Linksys is much easier to use. The interface for configuring the firewall options on this D-Link is very confusing. You can't just turn the firewall on for certain common ports, but rather you have to specify the entire range of IP addresses you want it to effect and it's not very user friendly at all."
1692,"I got a this item because my desk area at work is in front of others. Additionally, I often travel and have curious eyes. This however only worked when I had my screen brightness dimmed to the lowest. When It was slightly brightened, the screen is still visible in all angle. Yes, in all angle. I understand if it would be blocked in a slightly less of a degree but not in this case. So It makes some work more difficult because the backlighting is set so dim to work. For those that usually set their screen brightness at a low level by default, then this item will work like a charm. Otherwise, please be advised. After a while, I got use to the dim setting."
1693,"The Sportapros along with the KSC35's and the Portapros all use the same wonderful drivers.  You can expect very nice frequency response in an affordable comfortable form factor that does not stick into your ear like buds (no ear canal fitting issues and you are still able to hear what's going on around you depending on volume for safety).  I have all three of the models listed above and love them all.  The Sportapros are by far the value item of the three because they sell for 50% less for the same sound quality.  I've had the KSC35's and Portapros for years with no issues what so ever.Register your phones for the lifetime warranty!  The other day my little kid busted the ear clicp on the KSC35's.  I call Koss and explained I need to ""buy"" the ear clip part because my kid was rough housing the phones.  They said ""no we don't sell the parts... will will just ship them to you for free"".  The whole call took 3 minutes of my time.  The clip arrived three days later."
1694,When I was using HP laptop with docking station my favorite AnyKey keyboard was working perfectly. Laptop was replaced to ThinkPad. It does not have PS2 port. So I got this one. This adapter does not capture some of the key release. So I'm getting &#34;vvvvvvvvvv....&#34; when I paste. Shift key release has problem too. It happens several time per day. So it does not work for me. I need to look for different adapter. Thank you.
1695,"I have been trying to find a system that can do a good job with hands-free walkie-talkie operation. This falls short, although it's one of the best ones I've tried. It clips half your sentence at the beginning, and you have to have the microphone literally in your mouth and speak with a regular voice. That obviously doesn't work if you're in a place where you cannot speak normally and you have to be more quiet.Either way, it's convenient enough, you just have to still click the button on the walkie-talkie. It should have had a PTT button on the headset itself."
1696,"At $299 what are you getting over the Model One at $149? A $150 analog Alarm Clock ($299-$149=$150). That's Re'dic'er'us!! That said, Tivoli makes a great product...but unless you've money to burn--buy the Model One and get a $12 alarm clock."
1697,"I bought these and a pair of Mdr-E10Lp in the same month.  These cost 50% more and are very weak in the upper range.  To my ear the Mdr-E10Lp sound cleaner with a more flat response across the frequencies.  I was hoping the projection on these would offer an advantage over the Mdr-E10Lp model.... nope.  Be advised that the projection is merely a collapsible piece of plastic film mounted on an otherwise regular ear bud head phone.I have over six pairs of head phones.  Ultimate and Shure isolating (plug) ear phones, Koss porta-pros, Boss tri-ports, these two sets of sony's and the factory types.  The Koss porta-pros are my favorite at only 30 bucks.  The Mdr-E10Lp are great cheap phones too.  I hate the plug type ear phones as they are a pain to fit and then you can't hear a single thing going on around you.Phones are a very personal choice both in preference and what your ear is shaped like for fit.  Since I like to hear what's going on around me, don't want to spend another 150 bucks on Boss head phones that keep mechanically failing, and don't mind on top of the ear phones, the Koss are my favorite.I was buying these sony's to use in the hot tub.  My recommendation is to buy the Mdr-E10Lp over these unless you just want to blast out your ear drums and don't care about accurate higher frequencies.  The Mdr-E10Lp have a smaller driver so they don't win out in the base department, but to me they are excellent for the price."
1698,works as advertised. A common flaw in these hubs is the power cord exits the same side as the usb ports so can interfere a bit. If you don't use them for constantly pjugging and replugging it isn't an issue.
1699,The cables are middle of the road and that really depends what you are using them for.  I bought these to bridge units in my rack to the patch bay in my studio.
1700,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM CELESTRON.I made a mistake thinking I got a deal, after getting problems adjusting the lens to compensate for my near sightedness, I had to spend the $$$ to buy a NIKON 8x WATERPROOF binoculars for my trip to Alaska.  The Nikon did a MUCH better than job, furthermore the return policy with Celestron pretty much tells you what they think of their product, (WORTHLESS)Any company willing to make you pay a high premium to return their defective product for service is telling you the REAL worth of the product you purchase.  If you cannot buy a NIKON, get a VIVITAR.My opinion, stick to binoculars with FIXED magnifications.  8x and a pair of 16x should be all the binoculars you will ever need."
1701,"I was plesantly surprised at the sound quality of these headphones. It is rich and full and you can pick out a lot of different insturments across the tonal spectrum. They perhaps do not look the best and do not have the best comfort. But well worth 5 stars for the price. I am going to be using them at work, and they were an excellent choice.Update 11/17. My original review I have left intact above. A couple of weeks ago these developed crackling, then one side went out entirely. In spite of multiple efforts, that side has remained in-operable, hence the new 2 star rating. I wanted to leave the above review here, because, any product is capable of having some that end up not working for long. But for most of the products I buy that is not my experience. So I wanted to update what happened with mine and for whatever it is worth that was my exprience with the smallest possible sample size of 1."
1702,"My never-ending search for a mic that does its job w/o feedback.I was looking for mics to use while skyping (long distance relationship!) and blazed through a few mics that ended up not working very well.

1703,"I have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos. I used it immediately, switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything. It was exactly like a point and shoot. But when I learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed, I took even better photos. I highly recommend this camera. I took it to Alaska in August and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were. If you have the money, also invest in a telefoto lens. Sometimes 80mm just isn't long enough. But you can always add that later."
1704,"This cable is good for close confined areas.  Easy to manage and secure. Also, a quick carrying cable for on the go connections."
1705,"It may seem strange, but just about all the complaints and praise are valid.It is necessary to match the right speaker system to the correct needs. I have owned a Bose Acoustimass System for over 10 years. I HATED it at first, until I finall got it adjusted to my 15x21 living room. It took about a YEAR of constant fine tuning, to get it to sound like the demo in the Bose store. Now I can hear the different instruments in a song or movie, firing from different points in my living room. I did feel ripped off by Bose, in the first year of owning this system. I blame Bose for not working with their customers in order to ensure satisfaction. They have a good product, but their staff is geared to sell, sell, sell and no customer satisfaction.The problem with the Bose Acoustimass 5 system is that it is NOT A POWERED System. Repeat, it is NOT POWERED! You will need an amplifer or receiver. This creates a variable in the sound and creates a host of more wires. People looking for a two satellite system, are not looking for more wiring and complication. They are looking for simplicity.I originally bought This system to pair with a 40"" Samsung LED television in my bedroom. The electronics of the Acoustimass overpowered my bedroom, which is quite large. I had wires and equipment running all over the room. My wife was not happy! I decided to send this unit back and purchase the CINEMATE System which has two speakers and a POWERED bass module. This system is so powerful, that I was forced to moved this system into our recreation room. The  sound is now excellent, with the POWERED bass unit.Bose needs to change the Acoustimass 5 System to a Powered system and it would be ideal for someone that wants the rich Bose sound WITHOUT all the satellites.BTW, I purchased a quality powered sound bar for my bedroom  Samsung led television. Wife is happy and she now makes me happy. :)"
1706,"This worked great for me on all windows based systems I have used it with many HP printers without any driver conflicts.  I have also used it with all my upgrades (win98 - winXP) without any problems.It is fully configable with all the settings I have needed (DHCP, Static IP, SMTP, daisy chaining ect...  And I like to try all the settings! If you are printing to different printers from any number of computers in a TCP/IP network or Windows domain this is for you.It was a little slow on the large print jobs.  Someone in a  large printing enviroment should look to something with some built in memory. It also does appletalk ,NETBUI and IPX/SPX.  I will be trying the bi-directional (scanners) stuff very soon."
1707,"After owning the Visor Platinum for several months, I finally upgraded to the Visor Prism.  The Visor Prism has advantages over all other Handspring Visors in which it has the very nice color screen and built in Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries.The disadvantage to this unit is the flickering back light on the screen.  Once or twice every minute or so, the backlight will flicker.  The flicker may bother some of you(or most of you).  This is the major reason why I can't give this unit 5 stars...The other disadvantage(not major) is the thickness of the unit.  It is several millimeters thicker in some areas, and the springport slot is a little farther back than the Deluxe or Platinum, in which the Visorphone may be uncomfortable to use.  The Visorphone is held near the ear, and the Visorphone is set back a little, so the top edge of the Visorphone will first come into contact with your ear(may be bothersome, as Handspring enclosed these adhesive spacers for comfort when placing near ear).You have to use the cradle specific to the Prism, as it is a bit more expensive to purchase a second one.The advantages totally outweigh the disadvantages, as a reason I still bought the unit."
1708,"Forget what you have read, these are the best dj headphones in the market (I should know, i'm a dj). i've had the same pair for two years straight. i'm guessing that the people who say they're flimsy doesn't take care of them.  now for the review: they are very comfortable, they're loud (just the way i like it) because of their design, you don't hear the ambient noise at all (love that). if you're a dj, the single cup function is great. now the money maker:the bass, you just don't hear the bass, you feel it, they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in. in my opinion, these are the best headphones EVER!!!"
1709,now that I have used it for sometime now I can say that it holds up to what I put it through so I would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now I just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so I can have more of the long conversations
1710,"I bought these headphones in September of 2007, they lasted until June of 2009.The plastic ""U"" that attaches the headpiece to the side cup cracked so now the left ear-cup is detached and dangling.I hate to throw things out but they finally bit the dust after two years.RIP Sony Studio Headphones, 06/05/2009"
1711,These cables carry a signal fine but not pleased with the very stiff rubber covering. Have to really bend and twist them to reach certain angles. The connectors are also too tight and non-adjustable. I had to use a little extra force to join them to electronic devices and afraid they will cause damage if I had to take them off someday.
1712,Great to have a longer cable so you can separate your devices.  Works great and seems to be a good quality.
1713,"It sounds great. And over the last year, It has proven to be quite sturdy. Easy to store in the bag that it comes with. I highly recommend it."
1714,"My wishful thinking convinced me I could use this to hook up my ethernet-only Blu-Ray player to my wireless router so I could watch Netflix movies over the Internet, all for $36. As others have pointed out, it doesn't work as a wireless bridge. I ended up buying the ""Linksys by Cisco Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapter"" for $99 to get the job done."
1715,"Take what other reviewers have said about these headphones, believe them, and then multiply it by 100. I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. After buying a pair of KSC-55s, which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally, I hopped on Amazon and found everyone raving about the PortaPros. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not ""boomy""), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without ""bass booster"" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. After a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that I cleared out with canned air. Something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones (so someone nearby could definitely hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up loud).Others have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling, but I have a very large head and they fit me without a problem. However, if I will be wearing them for an extended period of time I always set them to the ""Light"" setting on the comfortZone control (which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your ears).I already had headphones I was pleased with (Sony MDR-G52s and Koss UR-20s) but I wanted a set of small, portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect. The folding design isn't something I necessarily wanted, but it is nice. The carrying case they come with (a leatherette bag) is a slightly tight fit and I probably won't end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing. Some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken, but compared to other small headphones I have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weight.While I wouldn't say these are bad things about the PortaPros, it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head, and that they don't fold down as small as you might think they would so don't expect to put them in your pants pocket or something. Considering these are the worst things I can come up with to say about the PortaPros, they are nearly perfect in my book.I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&amp;B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer! If you're like me you'll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones (haha! how often is that said?) years ago..."
1716,"Not really good for DJing, or industrial strength use.  So I use it to plug in my monitors with my laptop at home only, and then I have to wiggle and finagle it to get proper contact."
1717,"The dvd is just fine, tends to purchase a combo, end up only the dvd works and need a vcr to play my old tapes. Too lazy to return."
1718,"Packaging is a little excessive but it does give the headphones a luxury feel. The headphones themselves are very comfortable even with the pleather. They're actually really compact compared to many cans at this price. Lows, mids and highs are all excellent for under $100. The build quality is nothing less than superb as expected, doesn't feel plasticy or vulnerable to breakage at all. Need time to break in these new cans but I can say that these are similar to the HD280s but the Sony's are more comfortable and less costly. I recommend these to anyone looking for affordable headphones for music or monitoring in general."
1719,"PROS: It works. Looks nice.CONS: Negligible improvement over the wire than came with the system. Takes up more space than the wire.I live in NW New Jersey (Dover) but a hill blocks my reception to NYC. An FM scan with the wire stops on 4 stations.  I got the Terk FM Antenna hoping for more, but I was disappointed - a scan stopped on 5 stations. Granted that's one more than the wire, but the station I listen to most comes in better with the wire."
1720,"if you need this product in order to connect it to a switch view (KVM) it did not work, the mouse was not recognizedalso if you have a USB mouse and a convertor (USB to PS2) it is not working, it did not recognize the mouse , I had to directly connect the mouse, disconnect it (after driver was installed) and connect throught the adapter , and it worked until the next boot,this is not a problem of the mouse or windows, when the usb mouse connected to the PS port directly (throught the USB/PS2 adapter) it worked, only when the adapter (splitter is in use it wont work)"
1721,"I have run through a lot of earphone this past year so I am getting to be rather an expert on the problems.  This is one of the best.  The sound is THE BEST I have found no matter the price range.  I especially like the smaller ear buds.  Some of others were an ""areaness factor"".  They were so big I was constantly aware of their pressure.  I don't feel these.  They are so comfortable, I don't notice anything but beautiful sound.  Full range from highs to low with no fuzziness or distortion.  Just pure rich clean sound.The cord is coated and reinforced, so will take wear.Great item, great price.So put on Clannad or Silly Tinkers and have at it!"
1722,"The shipping took longer than i expected (came within twelve days[excluding business days]). Also, the wire was not what it was in the photo. The cable i received was way more thick as well as the body around the actual 3.5mm end. That made the plug to not fit in my iPod touch when i had the case on my device. This was why i purchased the item-- to have an extension cable that is thin enough to fit in my iPod Touch with the case on. SO, from my view towards the seller.. i recommend to not purchase as my order took long and came out wrong. & to top it all off, the cable did NOT work at all. I had no sound coming out thru my earphones using this extension cable. not recommended."
1723,"The brush sheds like a Labrador the other side is nothing but a shami circle glued to a suction-cup and overall the pen isn't that high tech to spend 10 bucks on. I'd recommend the AMAZON version to anyone looking to buy one. It's got great reviews, it's cheap and it actually has Prime Shipping. I though this one did however it still took 4 days to show up. Oh and the vendor for this uses USPS which in my eyes is a way of pissing on the customer. They're good at getting letters across the world quickly, but packages aren't their thing."
1724,"I'm a drummer in a rock band and I live in Manhattan.  My band's been doing a lot of recording lately and I've been using my new iRiver HP140 as I get around the city (the iRiver is AMAZING by the way - not only does it kick the iPOD's a** with regard to price, features, etc - but it records digitally, which means my band can get crystal clear quality onto MP3 or WAV just by setting up a pair of condenser mics during rehearsal and feeding them through a mixer and into the iRiver.  WOW - what a difference).Now that our rehearsals are coming out so clean on the iRiver - I was looking for a good ear-bud style headphone to hear the new recordings that would also block out some street/subway noise, but didn't want to shell out the $100 for Shure E2's or even more for the E3's and above.  I figured I'd give these relatively inexpensive Sony's a try.  Big mistake.Let me start with the pro's - as there were a few nice things about these ear-buds.  I had been using normal plastic ear-bud style headphones that came with the iRiver, and another pair that came with my old Rio.  These new Sony earbuds that go inside the ear are much more comfortable than the old style.  The also block out an unbelievable amount of noise. I've been immune from all of the sirens, subway noise and all of the other distractions in NYC.  If you want to hear your music in an environment with a lot of ambient noise - the ""in-ear"" style earbuds are for you (just try not to get run-over by a fire truck or ambulance in the process - you won't hear the sirens!)  However, all of this is probably true of any &quot;in ear canal&quot; style ear-bud - not just the Sony ones.  Sony did include 3 different size rubber pads which should be good to fit just about any size ear.  They also include a nifty little carrying case which is just big enough to fit the buds of the headphones (the cord stays loose).  This would be helpful for protecting the headphones in a bag or pocket and would probably keep them clean (since they go in your ears).  Sonly also includes a small plastic case (about the size of a business card holder).  This is convenient for storing the extra rubber ear pieces, and the entire earphone assembly - including the cord.Ok - I know I said a few nice things above - but unless you are spending $30 for a carrying case and rubber pieces - this is the part you're going t want to read.The sound is AWFUL!  I am a musician, and I have a pretty good ear.  These earphones are ALL bass!  But - not good bass - booming, thumpy, club/house/techno style bass.If you are into dance music or the kind of bass where you have a subwoofer sticking out of the back of your car - these are definitely for you.  If you actually want to hear the instruments and vocals in your music, along with high's, mid's and low's  - these are not for you.I tried everything - including turning the bass to it's lowest levels on my MP3 player, and even boosting the treble.  The treble from these headphones is &quot;tinny&quot; and flat.  The bass is completely overpowering and totally inappropriate for just about every genre of music, except possibly bass thumping techno.I used a &quot;Y&quot; connector and compared these with my &quot;free&quot; headphones from iRiver and Rio just to make sure I wasn't imagining things.  I'd take the free headphones any day.I brought these into the studio and let the other guys in the band hear them.  They were laughing at how bad they were (and at me for spending $30 on them).Stay away from this product - mine will be returned today."
1725,"This headset is my favorite. I've used them for years and they wear out from use, which is to be expected. I hope they keep producing it. If the headband is too tight for you, just bend it a little. It also comes with an ear loop. Great incoming and outgoing volume controls."
1726,This lens works well and seems to be very good quality.  Just a note that I neglected to pay attention to whether it was multi-coated or not.  My next filter will be.  It is especially significant on the UV Protection Filter that I got along with the Circular Polarizer as I seem to get much more in the way of reflection & sun flares than i think i should be getting.
1727,"This print server doesn't work with Windows 8.1.  I have contacted TRENDnet support with no response.  I used their trouble ticket online process, got a pro-forma acknowledgment of the ticket with a 1-2 business day response commitment...and that was the last I heard from them.  This USB Print Server is going back as &#34;Not as Advertised&#34;."
1728,"I had these headphones for about 15 years and I have to say the sound quality is excellent. The fact that they are still looking good means they are well made.  If you have a chance to buy them then don't hesitate because you will not get a similar value for the price anywhere.  About two years ago I ordered the replacement pads from Sony and just installed them yesterday, and now the headphones look like new.  As for the fit, they are comfortable but tight and after a number of hours I can see why some people complain about sore ears.  There is a slight difference in the older headphones according to the specs because the older ones used a Samarian cobalt magnet and these don't so maybe the cobalt was not as easy to obtain any more.  Now they are almost the same as the MDR7506 but with a better audio range so why pay double the price?  Now my only decision is whether to buy another pair when I have a fine working one."
1729,Tiffen makes some of the very best filters. These work perfectly with any Canon. I bought these along with the UV filters.
1730,Cheaply made junk.  I should have sent it back.  I still need a Nikon remote but would hesitate to order this one.
1731,I buy some things I think I need because to be prepared for when I do. So by what u can use.
1732,"I love my Prism and use it constantly. It's great for games and reading on the road. It does have some minor problems, though.1) In direct sunlight, the screen appears black, making it difficult/impossible to use.2) The darned thing is bulky as all getout.3) It doesn't work with any other Handspring products, except the styli and the cartridges... so you've got to have special cradles, chargers, cases, etc. And you can't use keyboards.4) Poor battery life. Don't plan on using this thing all the way through a trip. Buy a car charger.5) Customer support is AWFUL!!! I seriously think they were trying to scam me out of some money. They actually did get some out of me so that I could replace one IMMEDIATELY so that I could get something approaching a real battery life. Otherwise I'd have been PDAless for several weeks."
1733,Great product .I ues it to connect speaker to speaker.And to connect two mikes together...Would by again...Good for playing two guitars through the same amp
1734,"I have used polarizers before and use them with any camera that will accept them. This was an inexpensive filter but it works well, it has occasionally unscrewed from the lens while rotating the filter but that could be fixed by a dab of silicone of other product on the mounting threads."
1735,"I have been using this product for about 6 years now, i both the first pair in 2005, and still used it until last year when one of the cups, died on me. I tried a bunch of headphones but after analyzing the price and what they offer overall i decided to buy another pair of Sony's MDR-V700DJ. they have not hailed me in in all this years, swivels are great sound is amazing, it is all a matter of taste, and sound and as a professional dj this is my choice, i would recommend it to anybody.At the time i have both this, it came packed in the original package and on time."
1736,"Was sent package (repackaging from bulk, maybe?) the sticker on the bag said ROHS compliant-silly because all that's in here is copper and plastic- but theres nothing to indicate they are Tripp-Lite. 'made in china' on the bag too.They do seem to be good quality, and I've only terminated one cable and one crossover cable so far. Theres just nothing to say these are Tripp-Lite, and the generics are slightly cheaper. I got these for my job, otherwise I wouldnt care."
1737,"What a piece of junk. I am tired of having to restart my machine because this thing bonked out because I typed too quickly. Apparently it cannot process too many keystrokes.When I type quickly, the Iogear Mini KVM switch apparently gets confused and freezes up and starts ""switching"" the monitor off, then on, then off, then on in 1 second intervals. The keyboard is no longer responsive.The only way to fix it is to turn it off by unhooking everything that can provide electricity to the unit (all cords to both PCs).However, sometimes that doesn't fix it, and I have to restart my machine, which means I lose ALL unsaved work.My advice is that, if you work from home, AVOID this at all costs. If you are in the middle of doing anything important and you type one-too-many-keys at the wrong moment, your work is toast."
1738,"My husband bought Nomad II (c) for my birthday because he knows I like music and want to have something to listen to while jogging. However, it froze a couple of times during the first week. So I returned it and bought a iRiver SlimX iMP-350 and I am happy with my decision.Pros about Nomad II (c):- small, light- using memory, won't skip- have a clock- have recording capability- use one AA batteryCons:- It has limited capacity, even with 128 MB. For people like me who has lot of discs and likes to listen to a variety of music, it is not very convenient to tranfer files constantly.- feels cheap- To view time, you have to navigate and push the buttons several timesMy point is it maybe good for some people but not everybody."
1739,Would no function with my old MS Ergo Keyboard ! Sent it back. Tried other keyboard laying around and nodda.
1740,I didnt expect much from this tripod despite the reviews at the 17 dollar price tag . I tend find that peoples five star reviews are on this site are mostly nonsense misleading when it comes to technical gear . Be forewarned this tripod is some what wobbly and has cheap construction.You will have to use it were wind isnt blowing too hard or dont extend the center when it is as it tends be the part that wants to move. the extending column in the apex of the tripod is metal with a run of plastic teeth to do the extending work also which is kinda cheap.  For 17 bucks you cant really complain .I would have bought it again for the price tag.
1741,"Purchased what seemed like a good wireless router, but eventually the performance dropped, pages timed-out etc.  I scoured the internet, but found that my particular model, the v4, has persistent problems, and neither the company nor anyone else had a fix for it.  Eventually I replaced it with a Linksys WRT54GS.  Not a problem since."
1742,"I have had this radio for about 18 months and based on my past and present use, would have rated it 4 or 5 stars.  I use it at work to listen to the radio or, most often, the audio portion of TV programs.But with all the ads about television channels all going digital early next year, I wondered whether my little radio would still be able to receive TV broadcasts.  So I emailed the Sony customer service and got this reply:  ""I understand that you want to know if your Sony Walkman receives digital TV signals. As your Walkman has analog tuner, it can not receive digital signals after the transmission changes to digital.""  I am quite disappointed.So, if you are thinking of buying this radio so you can listen to TV broadcasts, you need to know it will not work for that after the transmissions go digital early in 2009.  It is still a nice little radio to take to the gym or on walks, but there are many nice little radios and some MP3 players also receive FM channels.  I hope Sony or another company comes out with a product that will receive the digital TV transmissions."
1743,Am I missing something here? The product details and other reviews seem like a joke. Do I need to download something to utilize these headphones? My MDR-V150 headphones I got 5+ years ago work better than these and I think the bass/stereo broke in one ear. Plus they are more comfortable.
1744,"Owned 2 weeks:The only thing to cause me to stop short of 5 stars is the weight of the lens. Stabilization is great and worth every dime. Don't even think about the other 75-300mm non-IS version, it is junk - I tried it.  You can hand hold this lens at 300 mm at 1/60!!  No kidding.  Focus is fast and accurate with my Digital Rebel - almost no hunting like on the other 75-300mm.  You *must* get a skylight filter to protect the front element.I'll update this review after a few months' use."
1745,"I'm a video professional . . . my normal brand was unavailable and Panasonic has a good name in the industry.  Not anymore when it comes to media, in my opinion.I've had nothing but problems with my batch of 25 tapes.I'm experiencing a strange lack of recognition of the timecode, like i've never seen . . . not just dropped frames.  It's Bad!Ya know . . . if you have an anomalous batch in your production, if it doesn't meet your quality specs . . . don't sell them to a discounter or something like that . . . just throw them out, will ya please!I don't have time for this crap.  Guess i shouldn't be buying one of the cheapest tapes out there, but i've had great success with TDK cheap tapes."
1746,"This camera takes beautiful photos.  The wide lense gives a nice straight picture.However...A set of AA alkalines lasts for only 5-10 flash photos.Using expensive lithium batteries allows the camera to consume all it wants and thus overheats to the point that touching the memory card burns you.  Laughably, the manual warns against touching the hot memory card after long continuous use!The battery door is plastic and becomes chewed up by the metal case.  Also, the zoom is easily damaged by switching on the camera accidentally when it's in a bag.I bought the Canon S50.  It was a couple hundred dollars more and photo quality is a tad poorer than the S414, but it has a rechargeable battery which lasts for a whole day of photos and the memory card hardly even gets warm."
1747,"I LOVE this microphone. But I've been using this model for five years, and I am shocked at the price / availability.On 20 April 2014, why is this microphone $70?? I bought it in January for only $25! This is an OLD microphone, do not get ripped off with this! Check eBay, you'll get a much better price! ($20-25-ish)"
1748,I used one of these routers at home to connect my desktop and laptop for basic file sharing. It does work ... sometimes. I often have to keep my laptop within six feet to get it to keep a connection. Pathetic. I wish that I had spent the extra money for Linksys.
1749,"I paid $7.88 for this last week & it's definitely going back to the store.  I used (or tried to use) it for Skype and unless I held it right up to my mouth, I couldn't be heard.  There was also a terrible echo on the other end.  By the end of a one hour coversation, it had quit working completely.  I had a Skype microphone that worked fine until my daughter decided to play Hannah Montana with it and broke it.  I wouldn't recommend even bothering this this thing, when it works, it works poorly and sporadically."
1750,"I bought this AP to bridge to the Belkin Pre N router which I like alot.  It didn't work!  After an hour trying to set it up with no sucess, I read the fine print in the manual which says it only bridges to another F5D7130 and an older Belkin router.  It's worthless to me.  Back it goes!"
1751,Someone previously pointed out that these earphones did not filter out the highs well. It may be the highs all I know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around.Now I may have gotten a lemon but the sound is poor. Volume cranked to high on any device I put this on comes out low at best. Put in any other set of earphones and it is painfully loud.The little inline triangle that has the on/off switch is cumbersome and is at a strange distance from the earphones. Just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough. Just doesn't seem to clip naturally anywhere. Either to much cord or not enough.I am not a music or sound expert by any means so it does not bode well that I think these earphones are poor at best.
1752,"I have owned these headphones for somewhere between 10 and 15 years and they sound as good today as the day I bought them.  I have not treated them the best.  I toss them in the drawer, I toss them in a basket.  Sometimes I fold them up and sometimes I don't.  I don't know what some other reviewers have done to their headphones but mine have been rode hard and put away wet, and still look and sound terrific.  They sound great cranked way up or very soft.  I use them for my ipod, my stereo, my computer and my TV.  The only thing that has gone wrong is the coiled cord has stretched over time and is a bit awkward to deal with. I can live with it.  I have owned some Bose triports and have listened to many others while browsing around audio stores and these MDR v6's sound as good or better than anything else I have tried.  I recently gave my son the Boses' and I kept the Sony MDR V6s'.  They are made with quality materials, fit well, don't get hot or heavy and sound excellent. The bass is accurate, full but not overdone. The mids and highs are crisp and balanced.  By the way, in comparison to others in the market today they are cheap.  I'm guessing mine will last several more years but just in case I'm going to snatch up another bargain set and stash them away for the day the music dies.  I have enjoyed these headphones every time I put them on and in my opinion you can't go wrong with the Sony MDR V6!"
1753,Just the thing to stretch that Cat5 two or three more feet.  I can't see any evidence of signal or speed degradation from this coupler when used to join two standard Cat5 patch cables.  Great item to keep in the box of tricks.
1754,"I bought a Platinum after not having a Palm device for years. I wanted to see what I was missing and see how far they had all come. The Platinum was a no-brainer when comparing price with the Palm-branded products. I thought I would give Handspring a chance. Well, I can say I am overall very happy with the unit. The hardware is well made and is sturdy. The buttons feel good. The screen is crisp and overall the processor is very fast. Although I wasn't sure if I would &quot;get into&quot; it...I find myself using it quite regularly. USB support is awesome and syncing is very fast. Updated Datebook+ software is also very useful. The backup springboard module is a requirement and a great addition. My only complaint regarding the unit itself is the backlight. The backlight on other Palm devices is great and can be used in a lighted room. The backlight on various other electronic gear I have is also very good. The backlight on the Visor is useless except in near-complete darkness. If you are in a dimly lit room and think the backlight might help, think again.  It really does nothing more than make it worse! Hackmaster &quot;hacks&quot; to reverse the backlight don't help the situation. Although I wouldn't trade my Visor, I wish that the backlight could be repaired. Other than that, I would recommend the unit to anyone looking for a well-made, expandable handheld computer. I *will* buy another Handspring."
1755,"This lens should have come with the canon rebel xt.It is noticable improvement over the kit lens.Within a month i purchaced the 70-200F4,non i.s.L lens and love it.I needed a better quality all around lens and chose the 28-105 usm.Image and sharpness are good at f5.6 or better and overall results are very good outdoors.I have only taken 30 or so shots with it so far but plan on using it alot in the future.I purchaced the canon hood at the same time.My next investment will be a good flash,but for now i am set on lenses.For the price you cant beat this lens,i recommend it as and upgrade for rebel xt kit,or buy the body and lens seperate."
1756,"What more can I say; the card received moderate use in a Canon 300D, and has developed areas where any pictures written there are corrupted."
1757,"I can't say enough nice things about these headphones.  You will not be disappointed.  I've had a pair for nearly 10 years and they are still killing it.  Buy a pair now, or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphone."
1758,"These are the only headphones I use now. I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones."
1759,This didn't work for me as a combiner. I was hoping to merge two antennas in the attic to strengthen the signal and add local over-the-air channels but it's no different than with only the first antenna. I'm positive I have it connected correctly.
1760,"After a week of light usage, it now gives ""This device cannot start. (Code 10)"" on any machine it's plugged into. Worked wonderfully at first!"
1761,I was using a cheap dipole FM antenna that came with my receiver ($2-$4 typically).  I was hoping this one would help with reception to get a solid stereo signal on some of the weaker stations.  Bottom line is no help even after an hour of moving position and rotating it.  Only advantage is that it smaller than a dipole and not as unsightly.  This one is going back.
1762,"First of all I'm not a musician,director or studio engineer( just a really big music and entertainment fan) and have tried several headphones and actually owned about 4 headphones in the same price range as the V6(and a lot of much cheaper ones) in the past  and while the ones I liked  were great in their own right, the Sony MDR V6s are the best sounding headphones I've ever listened to. The sound is very even and natural yet extremely detailed and not at all ""lifeless"" or ""boring"" to listen to. They have a really deep, smooth,rich yet accurate bass sound and have crystal clear treble and mid range.Overall, there may be other headphones that cost twice as much that sound better but for the price when it comes to sound, the Sony MDR V6s sound absolutely flawless for the money and they are a true bargain. These headphones are not only beautiful to listen to and come beautifully packaged they are also very comfortable and durable. I have had these headphones for 5 years and haven't even had to replace the ear pads yet and I can listen to these headphones for hours without taking a break. The V6s are very similar to the 7506s in sound and appearance but I think the V6s are actually clearer and even more detailed to my ears.It can debated by people that they sound the same but to my ears I can honestly say the V6s sound better to my ears and they have an even longer cord than the 7506s so buying a headphone extension cord is not necessary.Overall, I would definitely recommend the V6 to anyone looking for a great sounding,durable,accurate and affordable set of headphones."
1763,"This is a great unit. I've had it about 3 weeks now. I use it with my GE 5.8 GHZ cordless home phone and it works fine.  I work from home 2-3 days a week and attend or host conference calls about 2-4 times a day.  My coworkers tell me I sound loud and clear.  The set is comfortable; lightweight but not flimsy or fragile; with padded ear piece. I especially like the mute switch/volume control on the cord.  The cord is long enough to give me plenty of slack with the phone clipped to my waist band and I'm 6'3"" so that's important.  I would highly recommend this unit."
1764,"I bought the USR 8054 Wireless Router on a Sunday afternoon. After following the instructions, I was left with my lan connected computer able to reach the router, but unable to locate my modem.  The instructions never mention when to insert the CDs, so I tried to do so at this point.  The only software on the CD was for Norton antivirus.I called the help desk phone number only to discover that the line only operates from 9-5 M-F Central time.  (I am in Hawaii, but I imagine that these hours are pretty inconvenient for anyone with a job that does not involve installing U.S. Robotic devices.) I followed up with an email to their website's technical help section.  I got a response Wednesday morning simply telling me how to reset my modem (which oddly is not anywhere in the pictograph instructions.)  While this was good information to have, it didn't really answer my question.  I returned the router and have ordered one from LinkSys.  I gave the USROBOTICS a two-star rating, because I couldn't get past setup.  For all I know, it may be the finest router in the world, if you can get it working."
1765,"You can't plug two of these in side-by-side, the plastic surrounding the business ends are too fat."
1766,I have had the Koss UR -20 headphones for over a year.  I used them for studio recording and mixing. I use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better. The sound is balanced in these headphones.I do like the build quality of these headphones. I use these as my back up pair of headphones.  I recently upgraded to the TASCAM TH02.
1767,"These really can't be beat by anything else in this price range. They're quite comfortable (thinking about replacing the vinyl ear cushions with velour ones as the vinyl ones make my ears a bit sweaty after extended use..). I won't go into audio quality as there are plenty of reviews that do that. The build quality is superb. The coiled cable is sturdy, and the plug weighs almost as much as my cell phone! The included adapter screws on very securely. I ordered a few headphones when I was deciding on a pair and these beat out the XB500 as well as comparable Sennheiser and Sure headphones."
1768,"For the times when I want to travel light and only take one lens, I usually throw this lens on. Through its entire focal range, it does a great job. Its performance is exceptional considering it's not an &quot;L&quot; grade lens.The lens is constructed well and has a nice feel. I have an Elan 7e body and this lens complements it very nicely. The Ultrasonic motor is definitely a nice touch. You can't even hear the lens focusing it's so quiet, not to mention fast. I find that 28-105mm is a great range for everyday shooting, and if you're into taking closeups, it has a fairly good macro mode (although I wish it could be a little better...Nikon's equivalent lens has a macro reproduction ratio of about 2.7:1, which this lens doesn't come close to...but it's a Nikon...bleh).I would advise anyone buying this lens to also purchase the accessory hood that's available for it."
1769,"I bought this amp to raise the signal for my home because I have a marginal signal. I have diagnostic menus in my cable boxes and Dvr so it is easy to check the results. With no amp the signal to noise ratio was 17db and said fair, agc fair, with the Motorola amp the signal to noise raised to 19db fair and agc fair. This amp did not help at all. My symptoms were pixilation,freezing and video burping. Resold this amp to someone else.I have since bought this amp from Amazon, PCT 1-PORT BI-DIRECTIONAL CABLE TV HDTV AMPLIFIER SIGNAL BOOSTER WITH PASSIVE RETURN PATH and it is great.This is my review of the amp mentioned above.This drop amp puts the Motorola drop amp to shame. It is sooooo much better and less expensive.I would recommend this to all who need a drop amp. Since I have a metering page on a menu inside my Motorola cable and DVR boxes it was easy for me to tell the results. Before any amp it was s/n 17db-fair and agc fair. with this amp it now reads s/n 23 db good and agc good.PCT 1-PORT BI-DIRECTIONAL CABLE TV HDTV AMPLIFIER SIGNAL BOOSTER WITH PASSIVE RETURN PATHThis amp has cleaned up all my pixilation and audio dropouts on my cable boxes and my DVR as well.I have Comcast Cable as my provider.This amp is light years ahead of the Motorola amp, for the price and features you need to buy this one instead."
1770,"I have only used this for 3 days at the beach. I did a great job of cutting reflections and glare in the bright sunlight. Also, did a great job of deepening the blue sky."
1771,"I never got it to work for me. It installed fine, but nothing would recognize my CM11a serial controller on the COM port it said it was using."
1772,"I bought this mouse because I have had excellent experiences with Kensington Trackballs in the past, and the large ball was appealing in that it seemed like it would be comfortable for me. (I have sort of large hands)Sadly I was really disappointed in this product's performance. Granted, getting used to a trackball after not having used one for quite some time is a bit of an awkward time...it's hard to get used to your learned hand movements. The angle of this trackball's base, however is pretty steep...even with the provided wrist rest for cushioning, I found that after a short while I was suffering from horrible, shooting pain in my wrist. Having not ever had these problems before I went back to a regular mouse and all was well. It's a shame, because it is an attractive design and pretty sturdy. But in it's sturdyness I think this mouse is a bit clunky almost. I found myself clicking the buttons accidentally just trying to get comfortable.As for precision, forget it. No matter what speed I set this to, it was all over the place. Making a path in Photoshop became quite a chore...almost to the point where I found myself switching back to the old mouse I had upgraded from just to get work done.I wouldn't recommend this for a graphics professional or anyone who spends an extended period of time at the computer. For such an expensive trackball, I was really hoping this would have been a lot better."
1773,Worthless garbage. Some $20 Skull Candy earbuds have way better sound quality. These clunky Audio-Technica ATH-M30 head phones also broke not long after getting them so they were not as durable as I originally either. Don't waste your money.
1774,"Pros:Yellow makes it easy to see in dark spacesIt's thin enough to not get in the wayAfter using it every day for a month, it's yet to failConnection speeds are what you would expectIt's dirt cheapWithstands the heat from the back of a PS3 Slim.Cons:The little locking tabs are sensitive, and could potentially break if caught on somethingNo snag-free shields to prevent the locking tabs from breaking off"
1775,"If I had truly hated it, I'd have given it 1 star. Anyway, you plug this into the headset jack of the iPod and then, after inserting 2 AAA batteries, set a slide switch on it to one of 4 available frequencies (all on the low end of the FM band), set your FM radio to the matching frequency, and push the big button on the TuneCast to get it to transmit. By the way, of you forget to press the big button again before you exit the car, count on the 2 AAAs being dead when you return.There is more static, popping and crackling than there is music. I'm sure you get the picture. No matter how I positioned it, it wasn't very clear. I even tried to use it in a car with its radio antenna mounted on the front fender, but it wasn't much better (the TuneCast transmits to your radio's antenna, not to your radio's faceplate).I got the Griffin iTunes, and this was somewhat better to be sure, but still not good enough to make me give up the headphones or the cassette tape converter."
1776,"These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.Buy them. You wont be sorry."
1777,"These are OK slim jewel cases but they are pretty flimsy and not strong. I used them to distribute a number of promotional DVDs and they were fine for that purpose.  They are really not appropriate for any kind of permanent storage.I seriously question if these are Memorex jewel cases:1. The jewel cases did not arrive in a Memorex box as in the illustration. They had been bulk-packed in a plain cardboard box.2. The name ""Memorex"" was nowhere to be found on the box and there was no indication that these jewel cases were Memorex.3. I have a box of 50 Memorex jewel cases I previously purchased at an office supply store and there are differences between these and the jewel cases that arrived in this order. Also, the product number on the cardboard box is not the same number as on the Memorex box I bought at the store.Other than that, they seem to be about the same quality."
1778,"Doesn't look anything like the picture.  It is a VERY heavy dual cable which might be fine for a fixed stereo system, but not for use in extending headphones.  So heavy that it disconnects from my laptop. It's going back."
1779,"After reading a lot of mixed reviews on this product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I am a big talk show guy, mainly local talk and sports shows, and most of my stations were coming in okay. But when a local station, KCOH, changed from 1430 to 1230, it was not coming in as clear as it use to. Also the Jim Rome show switched from a very strong station, 610, to 650, where I could barely hear it. I ordered this thru Amazon and it arrived very promptly. I hooked it up to my Tuner/pre-amp (B&K PT Series II) and had ""mixed feelings"". It pulled in the above mentioned problem stations but most of my other stations wre not as clear! I started tuning the dial and moving the antenna around and it helped somewhat but not much...Then the cable disconnected from the loop antenna and all of a sudden the station, I was listening to, came in better than it ever had before! I started checking my other stations and they also sounded better than ever! So now, I just leave the antenna cable unhooked from the antenna loop for most of my stations and if there is a station that's still not clear, such as 650, I hook the antenna cable back to the antenna loop, tune it in using the dial on the loop, and it comes thru loud and (semi) clear! Not quite working the way I thought it would but it works!"
1780,"I am not an audiophile and use these phones for listening to SSB receivers. They fit nicely, sound good, and are comfortable. Excellent for the price."
1781,"I have used an MP3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now. I cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when I move. I don't want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find. The Koss SportaPro is the best choice I have made yet at under 30 dollars. They sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place. The band pivots for the behind-the-head  or over-the-head style. I find the behind-the-head to be a little awkward, probably because I am not used to it, but they do stay in place, which is great for push-ups. I have read that some find them to be ugly but I could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity."
1782,"I have made several attempts to download this onto my Windows 7 laptop. It fails every time. Three days ago I wrote an email to TrendNet, so far the silence id deafening. Zero confidence in product and manufacturer."
1783,"The ability to see long distance, including the night sky, was why I purchased these.  They failed.  Difficult to focus and not that powerful, I went back to the old, cheap binoculars I already had and which do a better job.  Sorry, these don't work."
1784,Does it work as anti-static?  Absolutely.  Just be aware the coils of the cord are wound so tight that it really doesn't give you the distance flexibility that it claims.  I wish the cord were a few feet longer.
1785,"I am an advanced amateur. I bought this Canon lens to round out my array of lenses for my Rebel XSi.  I was interested in taking macro shots of bugs and other small objects, plus have the capability of a portrait lens.  I haven't had it for very long and I haven't taken a lot of pictures yet, but it is impressive in its sharpness and accurate focusing.  It focuses to .9 foot but you have to have a steady hand since it doesn't have IS.  Construction is solid (notice the weight) and all focusing is internal, so the barrel doesn't move in and out. This is a great feature for macro images.I recommend it highly but if I had the extra money I would go for the Canon 100mm macro lens with IS.  That is the only reason I gave it a 4.0 rating."
1786,I suppose you can't expect a lot from a tool kit that was under 15 bucks. The screwdrivers are not going to do any heavy duty work but they are fine for working on computers. I got this for my son as he was building a gaming computer. I would buy it again heck for the money..it is worth it.
1787,"I just got this streamzap pc remote a couple of days ago and looked forward to using it with cyberlink powerDVD 9, Pinnacle usb pctv hd and possibly in WMC which I really stray away from as it is too big and bulky plus it does not recognize all the local broadcast hd tv stations for some reason.  Pinnacle usb mini stick gets a bunch but media center just wont get them up there and pinnacle player is good enough does everything plus i do have a good remote with it so the streamzap was for Media cent since there is not support for the pinnacle full function remote in windows. dumb again.  my problem is that since streamzap addition the computer shuts down (crashes) on its own . It will not re boot unless i take the usb plug out for streamzap which essentially disables it. the computer is just fine without it but as soon as i put it back in -the ir gizmo- all kinds of issues arise and the computer becomes unstable and untimately just shuts off and is not responsive plus it will not reboot, gets stuck right after the first load splash screen until i literally 'pull the plug' and then it is ok.  I did go for the newest vista drivers and no success possibly more stable prior to updating? not sure on that. I really wish it would work. i got only limited functionality moving the cursor around in powerdvd didnt really do as it was advertised to do. no menu , no ff or rew and then the pause/play developed a mind of its own and alternated about every 10secs pause then play on its own. so I havent found where the conflict is and probably wont. the faq is a joke only self serving installation issues none on conflict and the 'knowledge base' is under construction or maintenance.  No a word there about any issue good or bad. so i am out $35 with the shipping. amazon will probably take it back but then back to the drawing boards.  I was suckered with all the possible applications it might work with and the cursor will actually move about with the arrow keys but i have a friend who is a quadriplegic and has the cursor system he can move with his eye and it is faster than me moving this around with the remote. It is not quite synced up with the target click spots. moves around quickly until i get to the critical area and then it jumps around, over and along side the spot until i finally get it. I do have a few other things added to the laptop but all work in perfect harmony until I got this streamzap which I waited with great anticipation almost as much as the wait for my first 2 wheeler bike. So I am disappointed somewhat and wish there were places I might find a fix for this as I love the potential and envy the reviewers who managed to elude the blue screen and freezes."
1788,"Makes my camera not obsolete.  I had a hard time locating this memory cardfor my old, old, old camera."
1789,"So far so good, it's a lot better quality than the other cheap cables I've purchased here, no problem with this cable thus far."
1790,Just received & tested ASAP: photos taken with and without CPL filter. For my camera Canon Powershot SX40HS I strongly recommend the 52-58 step-up adapter the bayonet style not the threaded one (I purchased and tested both): It's easy and faster to install/remove. Once fixed the CPL on the 52-58 step-up adapter I'll leave them together always. This will prevent thread cuts and misalignmentsCPL usage - It makes the difference even I was expecting a little bit more cutting of the reflexions but for the money spent it's very good. Tested at 90 degres (as all indicate) vs sunlight direction and the stones are visible in the pond due to reflexions cut at water surface. As you increase the angle the more effective it is: it's doing the job! At the beginning you need a little experience till you find the max open and max closed positions (CPL ring rotation) then you play with the ring for effects. I'm looking forward to enjoy this CPL filter furthermore for better pictures.
1791,the sound in both headphones is ok .... but i must turn the plug many times to adjust the volume
1792,"I bought this play with high hopes and most of them are met. The unit plays well. The battery life is a little weak, but Creative Labs is very thoughtful and includes a second set of batteries. It recharges fast enough and I usually listen when it's plugged in anyhow. Be carefull of using regular batteries, they will be drained within 2 hours! On the good side, this does as expected, plays many hours of music, sounds great and is easy to navigate.The down side is:I would like to see bettter support through the webstie from Creative Labs. This is a costly item, it would be great to have Web chat or something to get simple answersThe software is not the best. When I try to rip Mp3's from a CD the first track is always messed up. I have to rip the first track from the CD to the hard drive and then trasfer to the CD. This is annoying because I am trying to save space on my hard drive..wma files are supposed to offer better sound quality at lower kb rates, so therefore smaller files so more can be stored on the Jukebox. But, I can't seem to get the same quality when ripping from CD to .wma with the Play Center software included. I get better .wma sound using Windows Media Player, but again that goes to the hard drive then to the Jukebox.i also can't figure out how to trasnfer from the Jukebox to a PC. The Jukebox comes with a couple audio books that I would like to put onto PC and make room on the Nomad for more music.Overall the next version of the Jukebox should be great. It needs a bigger drive, maybe 20 gig. It also could use a tuner for FM signals to make it more of a complete product. I would also love to see a digital out to plug into a good quality stereo. I would say people should hold off buying until the next gen of players are on the market. But, if you want something that holds 150 CD's now (600 if I could figure out how to get the higher quality .wma files on it), it's as good as it gets.p.s. Be ready to buy some headphones.  The included ones are not very good."
1793,"I took a chance based on other reviews, and was not dissapointed.These provide great sound, especilly for the price.I may consider the closed ear type for noisy coditions, now that I know the sound is great."
1794,"There is a sticker on this thing that says ""Not for use with aquariums or other water-related products.""  What the heck does THAT mean?  I bought this to use on a modern washing machine -- the kind loaded with electronics and a motherboard.  Is a washing machine a ""water-related product""?  How about a coffee maker?  If it gets damaged are they going to say the guarantee is invalid because of those weasel words?"
1795,"I just purchased the Sonys and I'm excited to share the experience. First, I've owned several different headphones in past, the last being the Sony MDR-V6. I thought it would be impossible to improve on them...but Sony has done it.Comfort: The 700s are all-day comfortable. The earcups fit AROUND your ears, so there is no annoying pressure there. The headband is nicely padded too, so you simply forget you're wearing anything at all. They are 'hefty' and robustly constructed, yet that weight simply disappears once you put them on. They're attractively designed, too...with a professional style.Sound quality: Like I said earlier, Sony has worked magic here. The resolution and detailing these phones provide will have you hearing things ""for the first time""...you'll hear things in music you never knew existed. I am pulling things out of my collection and literally enjoying them for the first time. The bass extension is phenomenal...a concert bass drum-smack or pipe organ will have you giggling like a kid! But they don't stop there...the mids and highs are equally well-produced.The phones are fairly sensitive too...my small headphone amp drives them quite nicely to db levels that doctors would tell you ""no-no!!"" But they sound so good...you wanna keep cranking the volume!Sony thoughtfully provided a nice long cord, too...it's coiled so it doesn't get in the way.Oh, my...the kickdrum in Led Zeppelin's ""When the Levee Breaks"" just about blew my eyeglasses off! Yeehaw!!Buy them...you will not regret it!"
1796,"This wristband is relatively easy to use, and the alligator clip is large enough to clip to most area's, so you can attach it close to where you will be working. The only drawback is that the coil extension cord is a little short. But that may just be a preference of mine. Works good, well priced."
1797,the product that was sent to me does not work.  I wrote the seller twice and have not had any response from.  I expect more from people who deal with Amazon.  I am very put out by this.
1798,"The Altec-Lansing ATP3 speaker set with subwoofer accomplishes what it sets out to do. Setup is a snap between the subwoofer and satellite speakers. The satellite also has the volume control as well as treble and bass controls. As for the sound, the treble and bass control radically effects the quality of the sound with a very small rangefor settings that could be considered &quot;good&quot; for sound quality. They take up little space on the desktop and the subwoofer puts out nicely. All in all, a good buy."
1799,"This is overall just fair.It took 12 days to deliver from east coast to Phx, AZ; it should take no more than 5-7 days to deliver.Part itself is not so rugged-built, even flimsy a little with thin aluminum that holds camera and/or eyepiece if small enough to fit in.This part should cost no more than $10-$15.00; it's not even real complex or even precision part.On this part, Celestron was not so impressive.I'm hesitant to recommend this to others."
1800,use withipod - mac g4 pb - powermac g5 - Creative GigaWorks S750 - recording setupIt sounds brillant for so a cheap setup.  Highly recommend it!The only issue i have it is not compact and sometimes the wire gets in the way.  Besides that it rules...
1801,"The Sony remote controller is suitable for techno geeks only but not for your wife or not for someone who has already been intimidated by simpler remote control units. I bought this to give my wife one key configuration of her home A/V systems but it can't do it. The failure is due less to limitations in the Sony remote as to the ""stupidity"" of the A/V components themselves, notably the television. While the RMAV3000 is well engineered it suffers from 3 flaws that should be considered prior to purchase for less ambitious use. None of these would ""fail"" it. The unit's flaws start with its bulk. It is not intended for one handed use. The next 2 flaws are interrelated. The display is virtually impossible to read under all normal lighting conditions (unless normal for you means shining a spotlight onto it). You must turn on the backlight. The second readability flaw results from the back reflections from the smooth faceplate. This is annoying whether trying to read the display with or without the backlight on. Sony would be well advised to change this to a diffusing faceplate or to add an anti-reflective coating to the existing faceplate. (possibly, you could add your own diffuser. I haven't tried this so don't know what degree of improvement would occur.The unit fails with us due to the way certain function codes such as on/off for most A/V devices and video mode for the TV set, ""toggle"" rather than having specific infra-red codes to activate them. Thus, when finger fumbling friends (or your wife) button push this or other controllers or the buttons on one or more of the A/V components and get your components into altered states, no single ""macro"" on this remote can reset your entire A/V equipment back to baseline. This is not Sony's fault because even the smartest, most programmable controller can't make up for the inherent stupidity of the equipment it's trying to control. The end result though is that I own an intelligent universal remote and still have to live with individually assuring that the on/off and video mode states of the equipment are correct. This means that, for my wife, instead of having to deal with 5 separate controllers that she doesn't understand, she has to deal with a single controller that she has to switch into 5 different control modes that she doesn't understand.Pity!"
1802,"Logitech USB Microphone.  I'm sorry to report that this device does not work very well. Windows interacts with this device in ways that are particularly annoying to me. At one point I received an error message from Microsoft, telling me that it had disabled some of the functionality of this device -- for my protection. I slept much better that night, knowing that Microsoft was watching out for me -- much as they do when, in Microsoft Word, the program insists that the first letter of the first word on any line, be capitalized. Thank God for Microsoft. Sadly, their presence on my computer is a reality, and they don't work well with this microphone."
1803,Must be crazy to buy at that price seeing that you can get this adapter cable free when buying some fans.
1804,The outlet is good quality but short. The cord is two foot. The outlet +the cord =4 ft.

1806,"The SanDisk card works perfectly with both my digital camera and Visor Prism's MemPlug card. The MemPlug module, by PiTech, allows a Handspring Visor to use a CompactFlash (or SmartMedia) card as if it were an extension of the hand held's own RAM. I made the mistake of initially purchasing a CompUSA CompactFlash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible. The SanDisk is a winner."
1807,
1808,Not a good quality product.  I ordered it in May of 2007 and now June 2008 I am looking for another.  There are very few made these days. I don't want another of these but may end up with it anyway.
1809,This cable is well worth the price. Connected my DirectTV DVR to my computer to enable Video On Demand. Works flawlessly.
1810,"The Trendnet 1-port multi-function USB print server TE100-MFP1 did not work for me.  I have purchased many Trendnet USB print servers before for myself and my clients without any problems.I wanted three things to be satisfied.#1 A print server that I could connect to my wire network, then connect to my printer by USB cable. The Trendnet was successful with this requirement.#2 I need to print from any of three Window PCs. Old desktop running Windows XP, a new PC running Windows 7 and a notebook running Windows 7. The Trendnet was successful with this requirement.#3 I wanted to be able a print from any of the PCs in any order without messing around with Trendnet software.  I just wanted to use Excel to print to the printer and have the print jobs print.  The Trendnet failed at this requirement.I setup the first PC with the Trendnet Control Center utility software and I was able to print.  Then I setup the second PC and I had to click a button in the second PCs Trendnet Control Center utility requesting permission to use the printer, then on the first PC I had to access the Trendnet Control Center utility and access the request to print on the second PC.  Once you accept permission you can print all you want on the second PC.  Then if you want to print on the first PC you have to click on the button requesting permission to print, then on second PC you have to accept &#8230; Then if you add a third PC you just multiple the issues when you want to print.I downloaded and read the PDF manual from the Trendnet website.  I spoke with tech support for 20 minutes trying to get this printing without any success.  They told me just to click on the print utility and request print permission, then to accept it on the second PC.  It would be easier to me to just have three USB cables and switch them when I wanted to print. If I wanted a manual way to print I would move the cables.So I am throwing device away and getting a real USB print server that will allow me to print from any of my clients three Window PCs without asking permission to print each time.If the description had told me I would have to use software each time I switched printers.  I could have made a better choice.I don't hate many tech products but I do hate this one.I will use Trendnet again for other devices, I will just make sure it is not a multi-function device."
1811,"I would not consider myself as a hard core Audiophile but I am certainly headed that way.  Let me share with you first of how many things I am listening to (same type of content generally but different outlets to hear from)In the Gymrecently moved from the [Bose TriPort In-Ear Headphones - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - black toSennheiser PMX60 Headphonesin both cases being played on theApple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (2nd Generation)ORApple iPod Video 60 GB Black MA147LL/A (5th Generation)The bose definitely has deeper base but Sennheiser delivers on loudness. Someone had complained earlier that its too loud where other can hear around you. I find this to be a feature actually because the gym showers don't have and sound or music there.

1812,"I have a Yamaha receiver that I was primarily trying to listen to the 2 radio stations on. It has the  coaxial type connector on the back. I experimened with connecting a plain old 6 foot coaxial cable to the receiver, and actually got 1 of the stations to come in crystal clear, and got the second station at least audible. So I figured that getting some regular antenna would solve this problem. Keep in mind both these stations come in completely clear in my car. They're both stations that get locked in on most radios.I ignored the reviews on this antenna because I figured ""it's an antenna, how bad could it be?"" Well this antenna gave me 0 improvement to the bare coaxial cable that I had hooked up, and actually made one of the 2 stations worse.In fairness, both the coaxial cable I used and the Terk antenna both worked better when I turned off the TV. The antenna was cheap, but since the coaxial cable works better by itself, I don't see any reason to keep it. I bought it through a 3rd party seller and have requested a refund. We'll see what happens.I researched FM antennas before picking this one up, and it appears the Terk antenna is the only reasonably priced one. I'm not spending $30+ for a radio antenna. This is upsetting, but I guess I'll just keep the TV on at home and the radio on in the car. I gave the antenna a 2 because it somewhat works, so it's not a complete dud."
1813,"I'm not much of an audiophile, and I admit that I initially shuddered at the thought of dropping so much cash on a set of headphones. But then a friend of mine recommended these, said I wouldn't regret it. I'm happy to say that he was right. Watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience. Brought out the best in my CDs and DVDs and the worst out of my low-bitrate MP3s. Every little click and hiss became clear as day. Found myself re-encoding a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates, but it was worth it. Best of all, they block quite a bit of outside noise. Great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environments.And that's not all. They pack neatly--they fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch, which is surprisingly durable. The headphones themselves have held up pretty well, but then I'm pretty gentle with them. The cord's plenty long and doesn't tangle easily. These little touches make all the difference.If you have more discerning tastes, you may be better served by something else more refined (and likely more expensive). But if you're looking to move up from cheapo $10 headsets, this is as good a place as any to start."
1814,The reason I purchased this was to use for my Symbol LS4000 barcode scanner through my USB ports.  Doesn't do that.
1815,I thought that this will work perfectly on Leica confocal microscope but diameter was a millimeter more than expected. Didn't return for the shipping cost and time I didn't have to spend for it.
1816,Needed something over 12 feet and this satisfied the need at a great price.  Unfortunately the printer died from the aftermarket Brother cartridge so replaced with a new wireless printer.
1817,product is not what you see in the picture.  Bad purchase.  I was looking for substitute for the way over priced Sony ones and not the picture so not a replacement.
1818,"I love these headphones.  They fell really good on your ears, they are made of that soft like material and the compression on your head is not bad at all.Oh the sound, yeah they rock!"
1819,I have owned a few Tiffen Polarizers in the past and they never disappoint. The price is reasonable and the quality is up to standards.
1820,"When playing audio CDs on this unit, especially in a quiet home environment, there is a continuous (albeit relatively subtle) noisy cackling primarily in the left channel that significantly reduces the sound quality of the material being played.  For some odd reason, there is no way to turn off this audio artifact of the antiskip algorithm, as the G-Protection switch only has positions 1 and 2 (no OFF), which can seriously diminish the listening experience, especially for quieter pieces of music.  If you have access to an audio test CD, play a track with all output bits set to zero, and you'll notice that the noisy cackling is gone, suggesting that this audible artifact is the result of an engineering defect in the anti-skip implementation.  Cranking up the volume of your music to try to drown out the static cackling is not a good alternative.This unit's more expensive cousin, the D-NS921F, suffers from a similar G-Protection artifact, although in that case the problem is an audible electronic chirp that occurs every fifteen seconds during audio CD playback.  Both units were promptly returned, as neither unit's unique antiskip circuitry artifact is something that the listener should have to endure.  A four-year-old Sony Discman D-T405 sounds MUCH better than either unit and has no such CD playback problem, whether the Electronic Skip Protection is on or off.The headphones used to test this unit were the rather nice sounding Sony MDR-E888 earbuds, which have a rather wide frequency response.  Other headphones also allowed the noisy cackling problem to be heard, although cheaper ones with less frequency response might not reveal the problem quite as well.Pros:- The specs on paper are GREAT!  This _should_ have been one awesome piece of hardware!- Includes AM/FM/TV/WB tuner, which is highly desirable to avoid having to carry two separate units- Relatively thin and lightweight- A compatible belt strap / carrying case is available from SonyCons:- Overall sound quality for the CD player is rather poor, given that there is no way to turn off the annoying antiskip audio artifacting.- Although the specs state that MP3 files up to 320Kbps can be played, in practice this is very much hit and miss.  Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.  256Kbps is better, but also very unreliable.  Presumably that's why the manual highly recommends that MP3 files be recorded at 128Kbps.  Yes, the lower bit rate seems to work fine, but the sound quality is obviously compromised, although not as badly as one might think.- No AC adaptor included; optional separate purchase- No backlit display- Most definitely not for audiophiles who expect decent quality soundOther:  At the time of this writing, if you call the toll-free Sony Network Portable Audio Support Line and enter the model number for this unit, your call will be disconnected.  In order to speak to an agent, answer ""I don't know"" when prompted for the model number by the automated voice response system.  Neither Tier I nor II technical support were aware of the sound quality problems of this unit, but that may be because of its recent arrival on the market.Sony - Please fix this antiskip audio artifacting, and you'll have a much better product!"
1821,drive I had fail shortly after 1 year and there is only a 1 year warranty. BUY SEAGATE DRIVES with the 3 year warranty you won't be disappointed!!!! I am waiting for my 3 other IDE WD drives to fail so I can replace these 3 drives also with Seagate drives... These drives are as bad as Maxtor!
1822,"Comfort is tops, but I think I would go so far as to say the specs for this headphone are a lie. On none of the several players I use is there any change whatsoever (contrary to other phones) in the sound with changes in EQ (likewise for Koss' similar pair, by the way)--that's telling me that bass and treble are beyond the scope of what these can reproduce, and that's what my ears are telling me,too. Transparency is lacking, as well.They're much cheaper, and I know they don't have the glamor, but Sony's  MDR-W08L phones deliver more sound for the $$$, though not at the same comfort level. I keep looking for (and buying) sealed in-ear phones that promise deliver better sound than the  MDR-W08L for anything like a reasonable price, and I haven't found them yet. Look, the  MDR-W08L costs peanuts--Sears has them for seven bucks in their stores. Buy a set and use them for comparison--see if you don't agree that they're hard to beat. These aren't the ones."
1823,"This is not a very convenient tripod, there are much better options out there that will attach more easily to unstable surfaces. This tripod actually is difficult to use, you have to unscrew to move around the camera's direction and then screw back on. Works better with really small & light cameras as opposed to mid-size Point & Shoots like mine. The screw become really difficult to use after continuous use, and then eventually failed."
1824,"I trusted the Koss name that these would sound decent, but was surprised they sound as good, and are as comfortable as they are. I have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable, and are definitely more comfortable. (These were a Christmas gift for my mom... she's very happy with them, too.)"
1825,"Scrap is not the word i really wish to use, but just to be polite, this is just a non sense product, I tried different combinations to give the product the chance to work.. it Failed to.I connected the output to my camera, then to a recorder, to a RF Transmitter, and not even noise or Humm went out of this piece of scrap.For the price, this is biiiiiggg  fail."
1826,"I've used a lot of different CD burners and several different CD-burner software packages.  I use this Iomega CD-RW drive in my home computer and it works fine.  There are a few cheap brands of CDs that it does not burn reliably, and occaisionally the CD burn software flakes out and requires rebooting, but frankly most mid-range CD burners I use have these same problems.  I wouldn't buy it for a business that required frequent burning, but it is fine for my home use.  I've used it under Win2000 for a while now."
1827,This is a good reasonably priced filter for any camera.  The polarizer filter works well and is a good addition for special occasions requiring a polarizing filter.
1828,"I've been a Netgear fan for several years. After trying Belkin and Seagate 802.11b wireless components and signal dropping to poor in the next room, I loved that Netgear components gave me a very good or excellent signal anywhere in the house. So when I got a TIVO I thought I'd use the Negear FA120 together with my Netgear wireless acccess point. Big mistake. Didn't work on the TIVO at all. To test it, I tried it on my computer. Didn't work there either. Called Netgear tech support, got a pleasant young lady, Chinese I think, whose English was marginal. Spent an hour trying to explain the problem, not sure she ever understood what an English speaker would have understood in two minutes. Finally she gave me a totally false and nonsensical solution. She claimed that the only way to get a wireless signal is to have exactly identical components on both ends, which of course is absurd. I later saw on the TIVO website they have a list of compatible adapters, and the Netgear isn't one of them. My fault for not seeing this first. But this doesn't change the fact that the FA120 doesn't work and the tech support was a total waste of time. I'm sending the FA120 back, and my view of Netgear has soured considerably."
1829,"While this is obviously not an L lens, it still has great quality for the price. The auto-focus is second to none in most situations and the pictures are very crisp. It is extremely well constructed, and if your on a budget like me, is the best lens to upgrade from the basic 18-55mm lens. The ability to Manually focus while still on Auto-focus is great for those shots you can't get it to perfectly pick up on. All in all a great Canon product. For the money its definitely 5 stars, but in the grand scheme of things a 4 is more appropriate."
1830,aw see my handset review.  I have had similar cords in the past and remember my daughter cleaning shelves of nick-nacks as he talked to her friends  .... cordless phones get away from that hazzard.  LoL
1831,This product works as promised but Tamron can't really deliver a good telephoto converter at the low low rate of $150 brand new.  The SP version is $250 and is sooooo much better I bought both and tested them.  Keeping the Pro SP for sure.
1832,"Boombox was ok right of the box. The problem is the unit is poor quality. My unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase. Here we are 7 months later and the sound has quit working. Delphi warranties the thing for a year, but its a big hassle. They should just exchange the unit right away. You just can't go turn another radio on when you using satellite."
1833,"I purchased this printer in August 2011.  First off the WiFi is difficult to set-up and then only works when it decides to work.  I ran out of paper (very first tray) which was 150-200 pages and refilled with new paper and from that point on it would not print it only gave a low ink message regarding the color ink cartridge.  Called Kodak and got some guy from India that rolled his tongue with every word and could not understand a thing he had to say.  He had a new print head sent to me which did nothing to solve the problem.  Did a Google search and found countless complaints about this printer.  Kodak advertised this all Winter, Spring and Summer hooting and tooting about low ink cost ($5.00) for black and bragging about getting 500 pages of print for a low five bucks.  The price of that cartridge has doubled now and I only got around 200 pages.  They also fail to mention that one is using up color ink at the same time you are using black ink.  I never printed anything that was in color and still the thing ran out of ink.  I sent Kodak an e-mail about this and got a very vague reply with a customer support call back number--guess where?  India.  So not only can you not understand their support people they also expect one to place an international call to boot.  Customers need to give Kodak a real raking over the coals with this one, it is a terrible product and the absolute last Kodak product I will ever purchase."
1834,"This is very low quality media. The quality can even differ from each individual disk, instead of per batch like with most disks. A lot of my burns don't end up having proper quality. Sure, they burn fine, and may even work for the average user, but the quality is very low. I now know why the price was so low. My recomendation is to find some TDK or Verbatim media equivalent, which may have the same Media Code in the ADIP &quot;RICOHJPNR01&quot;, but it is of much higher quality. Try to avoid Memorex media as much as you can."
1835,"These Sony headphones are a great option for the price range. The ear cups are very comfortable, even when wearing for long time periods, and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses. These were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit, and he says it works well for that. I've used them in-flight to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then, as well.Other reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control, but I have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since 2009, I believe. I enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie (or the boyfriend's practice session), and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too short.There is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones, but don't expect anything excellent in that department. With heavy music going you'll know someone is speaking to you, but will not know from which direction or what the person is saying.I do feel that the audio quality is poorer than you'd get with a much higher priced headphone setup, but for this price and intended use, I cannot find any reason to not give these 5 stars."
1836,"I own a Panasonic video camera and needed some glare reduction on it and so this seemed like the perfect choice between price and function.  The filter does spin as it needs to be set but this is a bit unsmooth for my liking.  Other than that, it works well."
1837,"Sony is so paranoid of people stealing music that they've made their minidisk player worthless! I have downloaded sermons that I tried to put on a minidisk to no avail, the mp3's just won't convert or something. Other music I have will download fine. Check out Sony's ATRAC system before you buy this, it is a nightmare transferring content to the MD.  The sound however is really good, Sony knows how to split the stereo up to very good effect, but overall I sold this because I couldn't listen to what I wanted to. Check out eBay too, they're going for $50! That tells you something right there when you pay $100 and sell it the next day for $50 on eBay!"
1838,"I like this headset, sound quality was great!Note:Cord is long.. No I mean really Long...It has an adapter for the large audio jackThey are adjustable for sizeThe ear pads are nice and soft"
1839,"Bought for a husband's dog walks, he loved it. At first. It was fabulous, got good reception of both radio and TV in Chicago. Then within a year, but after 90 days it died. But husband said, maybe it was his fault. So I bought another one. Same thing happened. Now twice. Same issue. Poor design. The antennae is the headphone wire and it just goes, even with careful, gentle use. So no, I do NOT recommend this gizmo. Sadly."
1840,"All in all the DVD player is a great value ($) having everything you might need except optical a output port (-1/2 star).  But the RCA jack with the bitstream information does appear to suffice and to be honest I cannot hear the difference between it and the optical on my older DVD player.The 1600 setup and running of this unit is very straight forward and easy, but I have to admit the remote control did require me to read the instruction book just a little (-1/2 star).  The buttons are smaller than the older remote and a little harder to read in low light levels (no back lighting).Reason I brought one:  The DVD disc loading is fast compared to the SD 3107 player and this unit plays DVD problem discs that my 3107 could not, which was a reason I replaced it with this 1600 model.  The image and sound quality is equal to my old Toshiba 3107 which cost me $ a few years ago which at the time I thought was a steal, hence the high value of the 1600 now.Unit setup:  I recommend using the componenet video output if at all possible and setting the black to &quot;enchanced&quot;, keep the 3-D sound and screen saver options off.Unit extras:  The zoom feature is nice because not only can you zoom in on more than one levels you can move around using the up down and left right buttons.Summary:  If you are looking for the most bang for your buck this unit might fit the bill, especially if you are looking for something under $.  In my opinion why spend the money if you are not going to see or hear the difference?  Take the savings and rent or buy more DVD movies, which is the purpose of buying a DVD player in the first place.Best of luck to you."
1841,"Ok, i searched for some headphones that were Over-Earred and durable...these headphones are look and sound Excellent! I can't believe i used to have a pair of Sony MDR-zx100, i know you can't compare the two, but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears. 5-stars! Thanks Amazon!"
1842,"To preface my remarks -- I am a big Bose fan, and have owned their products since the late 70's (when I could first afford them, at college).  I ordered the Triport headphones to use with my iPod at work, since I can't stand those one-size-fits-none earbud phones.When they arrived, I was pleased with their design and comfort, and blown away by their sound.  I was able to hear things in the background of iPod tracks that I had literally never heard before.So far, so great.Then they broke.The nice people at Bose eventually replaced them (although it took four attempts to get them to respond to my e-mails), and the replacement pair has a one-year warranty, as others have noted.  So why so few stars in my rating?Simple - I know they will break again.  I treat mine with kid gloves whenever they come out of their pouch, and yet I wear them with the knowledge that they will need replacing -- again -- in the fairly near future.  For that reason I bought a cheapish pair of open air Sennheisers -- 433's -- while transiting Singapore airport.  And guess what?  They're lightweight, have great sound reproduction, are made of sturdy plastic, and were CHEAP.Are you listening, Bose?"
1843,"I've only used this once but liked it.  I'm upgrading soon and didn't want to invest in a pricey 67mm filter knowing I'd have to re-purchase when I get to upgrade :)Standard shipping was fine, it only took a few days.  Packaging was great!"
1844,"Works great, easy to use, no complaints, except I wish there was some indication of when the number lock was on or off. A little light maybe."
1845,"This product works great with my Logitech Bluetooth mouse. I didn't even install any software- my Laptop came with Windows Vista and Toshiba ""Bluetooth Stack""-I plugged it in and didn't need to install any drivers. It found my mouse right away. I can unplug it and plug it back in, and it immediately is configured, no messing around with waiting for it to find the device again, etc...The only Cons are that this DOES NOT SUPPORT A2DP audio streaming. (Per an email from their tech support I finally got back today.) I wanted to get some headphones to listen to my laptop but all the headphone reviews say that if you don't have A2DP then it will sound ""tinny"". (so minus 2 Stars!)And I wish I'd gotten a PCMCIA adapter so I don't worry about busting this dongle-type device off.Otherwise it works just as it should and I'm pretty happy with it- I just need to 'upgrade' to a newer one I guess.."
1846,"I purchased a older version of the Sharp DV camera.  I had problems with interferance when transferring to the PC.  I checked cables, etc.  Finally, I emailed tech support.  Never received a response.  Better stick with Sony or Canon!"
1847,"I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all.I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right.Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident.Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day."
1848,"The Sangean 505 performs very well.A quality instrument. Comes with AC converter,ear buds, a roll up antenna and a very nice soft case.A lot of radio for the money.I have not listened to radio for a long time and am dismayed a the quality.Lots of talk and trash music.I guess that is the way things are going.Any way,I am glad I bought that radio."
1849,"This USB 2.0 card was purchased because I have an older PC with USB 1.1 ports and needed 2.0 for my new MP3 player. Since it has so many ports and I only needed 1, I figured I'd used another port for another use.  It turns out I have a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard/Mouse setup. The receiver is a USB unit. Naturally I thought I'd use this board for my keyboard & mouse. After I installed this card, everytime I power-up, I get a messaged from Windows saying that the O/S didn't find my keyboard! It then boots and finds both keyboard & mouse (both work through one receiver). Now, once the PC is booted and up, the MP3 player and software work just fine. So the problems only occur during boot time and then go away."
1850,"I've sampled nearly the whole Sony headphone line, but the V6 is notable for its flattering sound and good value. While it's unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile, it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music well.The pads are extremely comfortable. (However, continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years; Beyer makes fine replacement pads.) As you'd expect from closed headphones, the sound is a little ""closed-in"" -- but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk. These are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic range.The V6 doesn't try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio; rather, it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own.-- It's reasonably priced-- They play many types of music-- They're easily driven by iPods or CD players-- The V6 is (aside from the pads) an amazingly sturdy performerIf you're picky...-- The sound is ""colored"" (that is, not completely accurate)-- They have a closed-in sound -- a result of their being closed phonesI've since graduated to the Beyer DT880s, a notably better phone. But the V6 has legions of fans, for obvious reasons. Even people who hate Sony headphones concede the V6's attractive sound. They've served me well for over a decade."
1851,"Bought to go with a 18 to 300mm nikon lens. - Works well, I took it on Safari, and it was a definite boon when used on photos of Hippo in the water. - no one else on the trip had anything close to the shots I did they just got a lot of reflection off the water, this cut it out."
1852,"I didn't need it so I never used it ,,,gave it to my cousin also, he probably put it in a drawer somewhere"
1853,"Did not work properly at all. The only way I could hear anything was if I moved the headphone jack around a bit, even then the sound was choppy and partial. Really don't want to go through the hassle of trying to get me money back (not worth it!) but I really do regret this purchase. Waste of time and money, but mostly time."
1854,"This is a nice little tool set.  It may be just a tad bit pricey for the quality of tools, but it's great to have handy.  I keep it in my office because I frequently have to take computers apart.  This tool set has everything I would need and more.  But basically I just use the Phillips screwdriver all the time.As seen in the pic, you get 2 Phillips drivers of different sizes, 2 flat head, 2 hex head (great for tightening the hex nuts on a VGA or DVI port etc.), a chip remover (never will use this one), a torx driver, tweezers and cool little grabbers for screws lost in tight spots.As I said earlier, the quality is not something that would warrant use of this tool set beyond typical in a computer environment.  They certainly would stand to up to even normal use with a carpenter or mechanic or anything like that.  There's no doubt this was made in China for less than a dollar.  But if you're looking for a compact tool set to keep handy, consider this one."
1855,"I originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano, but my wife didn't see any need for them, so they became my computer headphones. Darn :DI want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head, yet are firm enough to not fall off. Sound quality is extremely important to me, not just blasting bass or highs or anything. These have excellent fidelity. You can hear the highs, the lows, and the mids very clearly on this set, and one is not overpowered by the others. One thing I have noticed about lower-end headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music (or games, or movies) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously. These headphones do not have that problem. After reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years, I look forward to a long relationship with these.I listen to a wide variety of music, and everything from Linkin Park to Mozart sounds great on these headphones, as well as a wide variety of PC games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival, to FPS games with explosions and gunshots. I have noticed with these phones, I feel like I have my 5.1 system on, and have to take them off to ensure I am not being obnoxious to my neighbors, only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that I am hearing. The same thing happened with our digital piano, I thought I was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them, but that was not the case. Anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations, or they do not know what sound quality is.Update 2/15/2013So, I wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction. I have put them on when I sat down at my computer, only to realize an hour later I was still wearing them, and not listening to any music. They are comfortable enough to forget that they are on, and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half. I continue to love them."
1856,"This splitter works fine, but be aware it won't fit if you ned a 'slim' plug to fit in your iphone case or recessed jack."
1857,Got this cable today. The cable has no mention of Belkin anywhere on it. In fact there is nothing written anywhere on it. Works fine for now though.
1858,"I HAVE AN OLDER MODEL OF THIS SAME STYLE OF ANTENNA THAT HAS ALWAYS WORKED GREAT. I BOUGHT THE TERK TECHNOLOGY AF 9330 AM/FM ANTENNA TOWER THINKING IT WOULD WORK THE SAME, IT DOES NOT RECIEVE STATIONS VERY GOOD."
1859,I mess with audio equipment a lot and I will say that sometimes the audio does cut out while using these cables but for the most part it does well. if the audio ever cuts out a simple Fix would be to twist one of the inputs
1860,"I've had this lens for about 5 months and it has been at Nikon USA Service for most of it.Just after I bought this lens (B & H - not Amazon), the autofocus started to malfunction. Once the autofocus completely failed, it was sent in for repair. The first trip to Nikon USA took about 3 weeks and was returned un-repaired. The AF was still non-operative.Now here is where it gets a little wierd. The AF would fail 100% on my old D70s body and fail about 50 - 75% of the time on my D2Xs body. Nikon of course said it was a problem with my D70s. I used a rental 70-200 and the other lens worked perfectly with both of my bodies. My lens was sent back a second time. This time I also sent Nikon my D70s body as well for them to use.Finally after 3 round trips, Nikon sent a brand new lens.If that wasn't enough, I have now tried this lens on my new D3s. There is now vignetting. It is soft around all four edges. Just as others here have pointed out, this is a problem with all FX format cameras. Well now that I have upgraded from the D2Xs to the D3s, it looks like a lens I did not think I would have to replace, will be sold. Just a few months after Nikon USA service sent me a fixed lens."
1861,"DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!I picked the box up off the porch, heard a clunk and my heart sank.Like another reviewer mentioned, I opened the box to see the tweeter plate vacant of the tweeter which was rolling around inside the cabinet. From the reviews, I was under the impression that BIC was quality and have coveted these speakers for a while. Now, having placed a replacement order, I'm hesitant to get my hopes up not to mention that these were ordered with careful timing to be home to actually receive them.From what I saw of the cabinet, it looked like a nice speaker, I'm just baffled at the QC. I didn't even bother to unwrap the second to see how they sound. Amazon's pays the shipping each way - maybe after enough are shipped back and Amazon says something, BIC will have a look at the issue.************************************************************************UPDATE: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...Second pair arrived in a box that looks like it came from a war zone: blackened with what seems to be Toner Dust, ALL corners crushed, tweeter rattling in the box. The UPS guy saw me carrying this back towards the truck and the guy smiles and roars away. Guilty?Amazon - you're paying for this one AGAIN. Returning and never buying BIC."
1862,have tried jvc and others but sony is THE BEST for home recording studio and other uses including watching shows
1863,This was recommended by a friend. So far have only used the cloth but expect the cleaner to work well. My big screen tv has not been attracting very much dust so far. Don't have a clue why.
1864,"This is an affordable cable and it works as it should. I've got it hooked up to my Canon printer and have had no problems using it. However, I would like to point out that the cable I received was not quite as described. Rather than the 16 ft cable described, I got a 15 ft cable. Also, it was a different-looking cable than the one in the picture. It sill works fine and performs the same function. The one star I docked from my score was because of the incorrect discription; the product itself is fine."
1865,"I purchased this unit 11 months ago.  Everything went well at first.  It was easy to set up and things seemed fine.  Several months ago, I started having problems with internet connectivity.  Rebooting has helped, at times, but it is very inconsistent.  I agree with other posters regarding Netgear's customer service.  It is among the worst that I have dealt with.  I have been reading the reviews for the Linksys Wireless g Router, and will be replacing this hunk-o-junk with the Linksys."
1866,"The picture gives the impression these maybe inner canal type headphones, but they aren't. They're the old-fashioned huge bud that pains small ear holes. Had to return these, because neither my wife or I can tolerate those.Since we didn't use them, we have no idea how they sound."
1867,"Not that they are any different than other slimline cases, but these cases are cheaply made and fragile.  They are effective in protecting disks against scratching and short-term transportation needs."
1868,"i was looking for a way to hook-up an old ps/2 kjeyboard to my new laptop. i only needed it because i had previously, by hand, put shortcut stickers on them for my djing app. the keyboard works fine when connected to any one of the tower pcs in this home."
1869,Strange sounds come from this thing... no idea why that is. The cables seem to have no interference protection inside
1870,"Uncomfortable, low quality.  I bought them for the gym but they are so uncomfortable, I just tossed them.  Didn't last one workout."
1871,"I bought these headphones to replace my Sony MDR-V300 headphones, which are the cheapest pieces of plastic garbage I've ever seen.  The V6's produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music I never knew existed.  I've got a Denon-Bose audio setup worth about $2000 and these headphones sound better.These headphones are ridiculous.  They're worth about $300 by my standards.  It also appears they are built to last, as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead Sony's normal cheap sh**.Update: the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat.  I strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous pets."
1872,"After using the Sangean DT400 for a couple years while working (it finally gave up after I dropped it into a mud puddle), I purchased this radio as it is small enough to fit into a jeans back pocket, has a digital tuner, has a button lock switch, and I didn't need the weather band function of the DT400.In general I like the radio, but I was disappointed that it doesn't have a clock display when it is turned off (the DT400 has this feature).  In addition, setting the station memory is a little cumbersome and the button lock switch is in an unusual place on the radio.Overall, decent sound from the speaker (I mostly tune to AM talk/sports radio stations) and I like the size.  A decent radio for how I'm using it, but I may go back to the DT400."
1873,"just received these-i ordered directly from amazon after receiving a fake pair of the red ones on ebay.  **i suggest buying these through amazon, not other sellers***  do not try to save a few bucks and get ripped off.  i would not even purchase them from amazon sellers-again, buy the ones through amazon directly.  please do some online research to see how to spot a fake.  if you have any inklings that you may have gotten a fake, contact KOSS.  they will not refund your money, but will try to find the seller and deal with it.  these are really good headphones for the price.  i also have a pair of sennheiser 202s that were a tick cheaper, but they are not as clear as these.  not sure how they will hold up, but KOSS' lifetime guarantee is really great thing i've read.  again, be sure you're getting the real thing-there are fakes out there (biggest issue is bad spelling on packages-KOSS would not do that).  glad i did online reasearch as this pair i received from amazon sounds way better than the fakes did.  do not make that mistake.  buy from a reputable seller. hope this helps you-great headphones-LOOK OUT FOR FAKES!!!!!!"
1874,"Nice size portable radio. Reception poor with a lot of FM band overlapping. Tune for one station get 2-3 overlaping. Battery door broke within 2 weeks of use. Biggest complaint is the ear bud jack that within 1-2 months of use I get either right or left side of stereo sound and not both at once. And I have to keep moving the jack to get one side. I tried 2-4 different ear buds & head sets to no avail. You can't get to the plug in socket to fix without damaging the radio. This is the same problem I have had with other portable Sony radio products. Needest to say, I am not buying another Sony portable radio. Oh, at least the belt clip hasn't broken yet, even though it keeps slipping off my belt."
1875,"Pros: CHEAP... f/1.8 is great for bokeh/depth of field effects.Cons: Don't expect to shoot anything quietly, or quickly with this lens.  The autofocus is nearly useless.  It is so slow, noisy, and at times inaccurate that you're better off keeping it on manual.  Also, 50mm on a cropped sensor is really an 85mm lens, putting you uncomfortably close to friends and other subjects.Personally, I think this is a waste of money.  I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras for $450 or so and it has been worth every penny.  It provides a wide enough angle, with a super-wide aperture, and a fast focusing motor."
1876,It was exactly what I needed and very sturdy. Great for what I need and the best part is it worked!
1877,"latest firmware 1.3.2 doesn't reliably pass dhcp to the wired network.  linux won't work at all, windows barely works.  the unit i bought has very weak reception compared to a friend's, so it is going back.  appears to be same hardware internally as similar device from d-link."
1878,"Yes, they are lightweight and I like the way they fit and work without being a plug in your ear like regular buds.The only downside is the sound.  They deliver virtually no bass at all but are loaded to mid-range and treble.  Unless you are half deaf, you may find the upper end on the painful side since it delivers really high frequencies to the detriment of the rest of the sound spectrum. Sony should not have put their name on these."
1879,"Product arrived early and packaging was simple/efficent and not excessive. The products work as described and are the perfect length if printer is on a shelf etc. These are a tremendous value but were an ""add-on"" purchase (which means you have to buy more than 25.00 in Amazon sold products to get the incredible price)."
1880,"I love these things. Incredibly flat response, great for mixing live or in the studio. Great for listening to music on my mp3 player. Excellent build quality."
1881,"Didn't notice any change in the signals I was trying to receive. My radios, eton 5, st909, and super radio, continued to operate the same on distant stations."
1882,but not a superb filter - however you will know that by the price. I bought it for an inexpensive lens so only wanted a sufficient product
1883,"I bought this cartridge to replace the batteries in my Tripp-Lite OMNIVS1000.  I'm not exactly sure how old the UPS is, but I'd estimate buying it 5 to 7 years ago.  Maybe the UPS design has changed in that time, but this cartridge was not a simple replacement for the original batteries.  My unit came with a pair of 6V batteries connected in series to the UPS.  This cartridge is a single unit with a 12V output, so one of these replaces the two old batteries.  My OMNIVS1000 battery compartment has some plastic dividers that separate the two original batteries.  This replacement is a little wider than one of the old batteries so it did not fit into either side of the battery compartment.  I did a little trimming of the inside with a Dremel and then the new cartridge fit just fine.  The battery can slide around in the UPS but it just sits quietly on the floor so I don't see a problem.  This replacement is smaller than the total of the two old batteries so I'm guessing it has less storage capacity.  However, it has been working fine so I don't regret the purchase.  On the other hand, I have three more OMNIVS1000 units all about the same age so I needed more replacements.  For those I purchased pairs of batteries that are exactly like the originals from [...].One thing I found confusing when searching for replacement batteries was that some sites showed this single cartridge without spelling out that ONE of these replaces TWO old batteries.  I realized only one of these is needed when I saw in the specifications that it's a 12V unit instead of the original 6V batteries.  If your UPS is the same design as mine you will not be able to simply slide out the old batteries and slide in this one.  Open the UPS and check what's in it now before you order any replacements so you understand what you need.  Maybe the newer Tripp-Lite units are made to use a single battery like this one, but the older units definitely are not.January 2012: Well, after 6 months of use we had a brief (few seconds) power outage and the UPS with this single battery in it failed.  Three other identical Tripp units with paired 6V replacement batteries kept working.  I swapped this single battery for a pair from another UPS and then the one that failed was working properly.  Based on this experience I don't think this battery is adequate my Tripps and I'll be replacing this replacement with a pair of 6V's like I have in the others."
1884,"Netgear is supposed to have a 5 year warranty (2 on the power supply).  I had one of these for about 18 months.  Over the last months it's been increasingly flaky, every week or two it just hangs and needs to be unplugged and started again.  It doesn't matter how much it's in use (it's done it when we've been on vacation with minimal network traffic).I called Netgear to get it replaced, but they told me that it's not meant to be plugged in all day, so they won't fix it.  Unless you actually unplug all your network equipement when you are not actively using it (I didn't think so), then I highly recommend avoiding Netgear products.*Update* I called later again and got to someone from a different call center and they actually sent me a replacement.  I actually forgot if I stopped using it because I just didn't trust the thing or if it broke again.  Hopefully/maybe several years later (the original review was written in January 2007) the product is better, but from the reviews it's not clear that they are.It's hard to get low-port-number and no-fan switches of good quality, but I have had much better luck with theHP Procurve 1810G-8 switchesI have.  HP also makes 16-port versions that I believe don't have fans that are more comparable to this Netgear (no management features, vlans, etc) -- for exampleHP Procurve 1410-16G. I've used those in the data center a few times when needing a cheap unmanaged reliable switch and it's what I'd get at home if I needed a 16-port switch again."
1885,"I was very disappointed by this product. First off, the photo shows ""Nikon"" in yellow stitching. The product I received had ""Nikon"" in white in what looked like a fuzzy sticker. The strap is too short to be usable. I do not know why it is listed as a ""wide strap"" because it is no wider than the strap that comes with most Nikon DSLR's. In fact the default strap that comes with Nikon Cameras, is much better quality than this one. SAD. I bought this to be an upgrade, not a downgrade. Being so cheap I'm not too upset, but it is still a waste. Don't buy this."
1886,"This is a good wireless card, with a couple of plusses and minuses:Minuses:A) It's 802.11b w/ a proprietary 22mbps mode, not 802.11g -- don't be fooled by the higher speed.B) It uses a proprietary Texas Instruments chipset that is incompatible with LinuxC) To get the 22mbps, you have to use all D-Link Airplus equipment (or equipment by the very small number of other manufacturers who use the same TI chipset)Pluses:A) At least when I got it, it was quite inexpensive.B) The drivers are stable and the management applet was easy to useC) If you do get all TI-based equipment, you get noticeably better performance than a standard 11mbps 802.11b systemFinal verdict: If you can, buy 802.11g equipment, not 802.11b."
1887,"The APC P74 has impressive specs for such a low cost multi-outlet strip.The joules rating of a surge suppressor is over-hyped. More is fine but several hundred is usually enough, and thousands is overkill.What is far more important is the key rating is the UL 1449 TVSS (""Transient Voltage Spike Suppression"" aka: clamping voltage) Rating, and the specs on APC's website (at [...] ) state that the P74 has a maximum TVSS of 330 volts.The only problem is, the actual unit I got is far worse than that: 400 volts line-to-neutral, 400 volts neutral-to-ground and 500 volts line-to-ground. In fact, if you look closely at the second picture (of the back side) that has already been posted above, you can see those exact ratings. A good suppressor will have at most 400 volts on all three, and a better quality suppressor (like the P74 is supposed to be) will be 330v on all three.____________UPDATE: I have now been in contact with APC technical support. Here is the answer that I got from ""Murli"" at APC:""Thank you for contacting Schneider Electric. You have reached APC's customer care center email support on 05/17/2012 10:21 PM. I would be happy to assist you.Please be advised that P74 has a UL 1449 TVSS Rating of 330V.If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me by responding to this incident. It would be my pleasure to ensure that your issue is quickly resolved!""__________Here's my response to APC tech support:Thanks for the reply. I appreciate your advisement that the P74 has a UL 1449 TVSS Rating of 330V.However, the P74 I just bought has a tag on the back that clearly states the UL 1449 rating is 400volts ( L-N & N-G) and 500v ( L-G).I have taken photos of the back of the P74, clearly showing that the UL 1449 rating on that tag is NOT 330v [photos were attached in the email, and also now posted on Amazon]. As the above photos clearly show, the P74 I received from does not have a a UL 1449 rating of 330v as the specs state. The ratings tag shown in the second photo is unambiguous.Please advise how I can purchase a P74 that DOES have the advertised UL 1449 rating of 330volts."
1888,"Com'on folks...let's be real here.  The Coby CV-H42 headphones may have decent sound for a pair of cheap headphones, but com'on...they're only $5 or less.  I've tried them on a non-amplified computer monitior at work, and they sound decent.  The bass is average at best.  If these have a 40mm driver, then I'd hate to hear what a smaller one in a Coby set would sound like.I've also tried them on my at-home 5.1 amplified PC set-up and they distort way too easily.  The bass distorts at almost the slightest bit of bass.And I concur with those who say that it's a roll of the dice to get a good working pair, as the left-speaker in my set is a bit weak.I mean let's face it...these are some pretty cheap headphones...if you want a cheap, but great sounding pair of headphones, you better look to a set in the $15+ range.  Take for instance the KOSS KTX-PRO 1 Titaniums for $18 here on Amazon.  They're sold for upwards of $45 at retailers like Radio Shack.  And from all the glowing reviews, they're a hellava set of headphones.I gave this set 2-stars only because they're decent for a cheap pair, but for audiophiles, stear clear."
1889,You will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones.  Good cord length to.  Priced right.
1890,They really don't help that much unless you have a pretty heavy telescope. Most of the giggling I had was where my OTA attached to the mount (I didn't know this until I purchased these) because they did nothing for the problem. I reinforced the inside of the OTA and no more giggles with or without the suppression pads...before you buy take a good hard look elsewhere and save the money.
1891,"I've been using and have been frustrated with this product since early February.  SanDisk's Tech Support has been of no help; they just blame the drivers, etc.  When they are backed against the wall they just want me to send it back to them for replacement, which can cost me almost again what I paid for it.Anyway, I can get it to work if I restart my PC.  If I eject the memory card as they instruct I get an error dialog: &quot;Cannot Unmount Volume&quot;(red circle with an &quot;X&quot; in it and an &quot;OK&quot; button).  When I insert the next media into it I get another error: &quot;'disk' refers to a location that is unavailable&quot;.  I then have to restart the PC to use that memory card.When I get the thing working there is very little speed improvement over my older ImageMate CompactFlash Reader SDDR-31 that uses the USB 1.1 standard.  Transfering a 141MB file using the 6-in-1 device took 1 minute and 31 seconds.  The same file took 2 minutes and 45 seconds on the USB 1.1 device.  That's not even twice as fast.  This test was conducted unscientifically using a SimpleTech STI-CF/256 256MB CompactFlash card.  The timing was done with a stop watch timing the period of time that the file trasfer dialog was being displayed.  My PC is a Dell Dimension 4550 running Windows XP Professional SP1.  This PC uses the Intel 845P chipset that supports both USB 2.0 and USB 1.1.  The USB ports were not being used for anything else during the test.From my searches on the Web, I have found that I'm not alone when it comes to problems with this device.  SanDisk promises much and does not deliver and is quick to pass the blame to others.  They make a good product with their Ultra CompactFlash line of memory cards.  They need to pass along this type of engineering and quality to their other devices."
1892,"I have had my Acoustimass system since around 2002, and it's been a long road over the years, acquiring better sound through pseudo-upgrades and home entertainment advancements.The initial setup is terrible.  The center speaker is way too small to provide adequate voice ambiance, and I recommend from the get-go just buying a better center speaker.  I got a Polk Audio about 7 years ago, and it was TOTALLY worth it.Moreover, I switched out the front right/left with Bose V-301s to try and be consistent with company name and retain a more balanced audio without fiddling too much with the receiver audio EQ.  It certainly widened the front speaker environment and was worth upgrading based on the desire to keep my Acoustimass as the main home theater system.I move a LOT... Over ten years I've had to set up and break down these speakers at least 15 times.  I used the four original small speakers for rear surround and made a 7.1 setup.  It sounded good, and always has.  I threw away the center speaker a long time ago, and just last month one of the four original speakers blew.  Now it's a 5.1 system, and I'm saving up to get a more ""proper"" home theater that will make me never ever choose Bose ever again.I don't play at extremely high volumes; I have apartment neighbors I don't wish to disturb.  Regardless, audio levels for this system isn't meant to blow you out of the water.  That's a sacrifice of small speaker home theaters.  At the same time, I've been using these for TEN YEARS... to have a speaker finally go kaput doesn't warrant too much sadness from me.  One of the other speakers had a faulty wire input; the button to depress the clamps was stuck in the ""open"" position and I couldn't get the wire to connect with the speakers.  I hate this design, it's terrible.These are PERFECT if you want to keep a smaller footprint when moving, and is fine if you like ""good"" sound and have a small place.They certainly sound good and present better fidelity when using lossless audio on blurays.  The switch to DVD audio is noticeable.However, if you want true quality audio these Bose speakers are going to be lacking.Pros:Small, space-saving speakersLasted for 10 years so farDecent soundCons:Should at LEAST get a new center speakerSmall size and hype doesn't compare to better speakers, even in similar price range (but a little larger)The speakers have a badly designed button to open the wire clampsIn the end, if you want to have a much-improved performance from the Bose Acoustimass, expect to invest at least $200 more dollars for a center speaker; up to $600 more for center speaker, stands and/or new front L/Rs.So instead of $400, you'd expend $600-$900 for your home theater.  Is it worth it then?  Kinda/sorta.  If you're a smart shopper, you can find large front speakers, rear bookshelf speakers and a decent 10"" sub for the same price or even a couple hundred more, and you'll be 100x more satisfied with the audio than dishing out ""decent"" sound from the Bose.I say, save your pennies a couple/few months longer and just get the better system right away... unless you're ADAMANT about going Bose or saving space.I have decided that 11 years will be the expiration date for these, and even though I move and have to pay for extra weight and use up more space, I want a massive upgrade from these average performers."
1893,"I purchased this camera wishing to move with digital age. I am a film camera user for the last 5 years and this one is my first digital camera in last two years.As usual Amazon did a great job in shipping my order in a timely manner, before the expeted delivery date. Thanks amazon.The camera itself was the surprise. I bought it after spending hours reading and searching for the best value/performance data in several forums and decided to go for it. So I am going to tell you what I liked most,Pros:- Good construction, made of alluminium. Picture quality is quite good (not that great as lot of reviewers mentioned here). My old Olympus C-211 2.1mpx took much better photos at ISO 100 than this one.4x zoom with 4 megapixel sensor, video recording with sound, manual focussing and lots of controls (most of them are useless at the end, I will talk about them later) and use of cheap CF card makes it a very attractive camera for film converts. Additionally I purchased a nice leather (fake) case for the camera as a lot users reported that the camera gets ""Turned On"" by itself while seating inside a pocket. The camera is relatively big, so I feel much easier to handhold it, always good for film converts. I never expected some of the surprising features like spot metering, live histogram and tiff file shooting in such an inexpensive camera.CONS:- Everything aside what I mentioned above. Picture quality, I don't know how good it is compared to others, but to me simply acceptable when comapre photos from my 3 year old C-211. Noise is much better controlled than my old camera though, but ISO 400 is equally unusable. I took most of my test shots at ISO 64 and 100.the real drawback of this camera is focussing. Even in normal daylight it miss autofocus like a moron. You will have no clue as you shoot. It will beep indicating autotofocus, looking at the LCD is a pure pain...all blurred image. Remember I am not a newbie and I know how to handhold a camera and mionimize shaking.Low light autofocus is even more pathetic....it's more like tossing a coin in the air.there is an option of manual focussing, but hey..I better use a 10 year old film camera if I have to use manual focussing for 50% of my shots.LCD screen is although quite big fo rthe price, is again not useful as it does not have any antiglare coating, so in outdoors you are pretty much stuck upon your luck.Video quality is nothing great..choppy at the best. Sound quality is also at best choppy.Another starange problem is heat build up. After 15 minutes of continuous use it becomes quite hot (not wram) around the battery compartment area. Should be good in midwest cold, huh!S414 is quite slow when it comes to write tiff files to the CF card and a better (I used a 80X lexar pro card) wont improve this fact. So DO NOT waste money on a faster card if you ever buy this camera (hope you will not do that). At the end I must mention the poor quality of power consumption. My 1800MAh batteries last for two card ( 128x2MB) loads of photos and I believe this is not at par with most of the recent cameras in the market.Supplied software is also just avarage..dont expect a lot out of it.So my conclusion:- Stay away if you can. Buy it if you have to go digital and you absolutely need a 4 MPX camera with 4x optical zoom."
1894,"The sound is pretty good for small in-ear headphones as these, certainly better than other brands I've tried, and the price is good too. The only slight irritation is that the foams fall off quite easily."
1895,This is the most expensive of this type of antenna by $1 to $6.  Yet the manufacturer does not see fit to provide a cord that has the mini-phone plug on BOTH ends of the cheap little cord that is provided to attach the antenna to the radio.  I would guess that at least half of the radios this antenna would be used with have a mini-phone plug as the antenna input.  And Terk or whoever makes this thing cannot spend another 25 cents to provide a plug or 50 cents to provide another cord.
1896,"These are excellent and HUGE step up from the SONY MDR-V600! The sound isolation is good and the headphones bring new life into your existing music collection. You'll hear sounds you've never heard before.I also have the Grado SR60, and those are very good open-ear phones. These are just as good in terms of sound quality. They are also a significant step up from my previous SONY MDR-V600 (which I didn't like and the foam deteriorated quickly).I highly recommend it. As usual, Amazon delivery was quick and arrived before my trip."
1897,"I liked the quality this mic recorded at, but the volume was so low even right against the edge of the desk that I had to replace this with a clip-on. Later replaced that with the stationary mic on the Lifecam Studio for convenience, but did not enjoy this mic. Heard something about a defective batch but did not try soldering this mic."
1898,"I've had my pair of V600's for at least 7 years and they still sound great.  There is a bit of wear and tear and I take good care of my things.  They were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up.  the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit, but it does not affect sound quality or comfort.so lets see, 7 years at $70.  At $10 a year, I am very happy with this purchase.EDIT (6/14/11):I still have these though I don't use them very often. Too bulky and the cord is very long. They still sound great though after all these, wow 13+ years! These things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes. In other words, they have held up better than a slightly neglected pet."
1899,"My EX71SL failed after about 8 hours of use.  The right channel audio level decreased significantly below that of the left channel.  I had to return it Sony in Laredo TX at a USP cost of almost $10.  What kind of warrenty is that?  Sony should be more like Koss.I gave it that extra star for its bass quality, which is deep bass, smooth & mellow.  Really good, true bass can be very exciting because it is heard so infrequently.  Bass depends on the speaker, the enclosure and the room accoustics for regular speakers; including where you are in the room.  Headphones overcome most of these variables.  When comparing headphones, I use Telarc 80235 'Fiesta'.  It is a great Latin music CD.  It was given a 10/10 for both recording quality and for the music quality by 'CD Mag' (now defunct) several years ago.  Anyhow, this Sony has good bass vs boom, boom but unfortunately it is not of much use if it doesn't work properly."
1900,"I record interview audio for video/DSLR shoots professionally. My go-to system begins with a Sennheiser MKH416-T short shotgun mic into a Sound Devices 302 mixer (which can power the T-power mic), the line-in into a JuicedLink RM222 then into a Nikon D800, then recording to the HDMI output to an Atomos Ninja.To monitor, I plug my trusty MDRV6's into the monitor out of the 302 mixer, which is listening via its return to the headphone output of the Nikon. With a knob turn, I can then listen to any of the mixer's three inputs directly or to the camera's return confidence feed.If it sounds good in the Sony MDRV6's, it'll sound good in the edit.Yes, there are way more expensive headphones, but I know how the MDRV6's sound, I trust them, and they never break.The biggest problem is coworkers &#34;borrowing&#34; them and not returning them. Write your name on them in large letters."
1901,"For a stereo pair of computer speakers, these aren't too bad (Which is rarely the case with Bose, but we won't let my opinion of the company get in the way with my opinion of the product).  They do indeed sound quite decent for a fairly small set of computer speakers.  Bass is present, unlike most small speakers, and they have a reasonably full sound.They also have a nifty feature that some people might put to great use - they have 2 audio inputs, and can actually mix them together (And you can control the volume levels of both of them), which is as far as I know, a unique feature to computer speakers.  This is nifty because you could do something like run your TV's audio output into them while having the computer plugged into them too, so you get somewhat better sound than cheap TV speakers and can still hear the sound from the computer.The problem is for the price, you can get significantly better sound with some Monsoons or other similar computer speakers, which not only sound a bit better in the mids and treble, they also include small subwoofers that handle bass better than the MediaMates.Overall, these aren't a great deal for most people, but if you are looking for a powered stereo pair of speakers and plan on using the mixer feature, they are your only choice.  If you don't plan on using the mixer feature, I reccomend you compare them to other speakers in the price range, especially if you have the room for a small subwoofer."
1902,"I need a big, but not too big bag so that I can have most of my things (camera, lenses, flash etc.) there and are still able to carry it around on my shoulder. I got the 5613 Ultra Pro first. That' s a good, bigger bag. I can have almost all my things in there, but it is too big for me to carry it around as a shoulder bag. Then, I got 5608. That's way too small and the description isn't accurate for its size. This one, 5612, is a good balance for me. It is not as big as some claim. Smaller than this one would be difficult to have a full-frame DSLR and a few lenses there. Even at the 5612 size, I cannot have all my lenses there. With two cameras, it is inadequate. But, this is a compromise shoulder bag. I'll keep it. The downside for improvement is organization of the compartments. With long or wide lenses, one has to reorganize the spaces because most are too small for lenses with hood on. If you switch lenses often and don't want to take the hood on/off often, there is  a good chance you won't like the way the compartments are divided. The two layers room arrangement is inconvenient but I'm not certain there is a better alternative for a  shoulder bag. Well, I may have to keep the 5613 as well because that one gives you much easier access of things quickly. But, it is just too big as a shoulder bag to carry around for long. Overall, 5612 is a good balance for a serious photographer, amateur or professional."
1903,"Let's start with the obvious from all the reviews. The bokeh is fine. The lens is pretty fast. f2.8 to f22 is useful as a creative range. The optics are sharp and the all-time focusing is a boon. So what's not to like?Well, here's the thing. The Canod EOS40D, which I use, has the ability to use the viewfinder in ""live preview"" mode, and when doing so, will allow you to zoom in on your focus point (or anywhere else, but that's irrelevant to my point here) such that you can see extremely fine detail. At which point you can manually focus the lens so that it is exactly right. Marvelous, right?It would be. But the lens has some mechanical backlash problems. Let me explain backlash; if you're not familiar with it, it takes a bit of describing.Backlash is a problem that occurs in gear trains or arrangements that causes the finest adjustments to repeatedly over or under adjust, depending on which way you are going, because the gears don't (can't, really) fit perfectly together.In a standard gear train, the gear teeth have a little bit of freedom to move before they make contact with the teeth of the next gear in the gear train, and this causes movement of the gear to be without resistance.The gear turns relatively easily, because it isn't actually engaged, and then when the teeth actually make contact a fraction of a turn later, they ""slam"" together and more of an adjustment is made than one would expect.Which in turn requires adjusting the other way, but now the gear has to move back across the non-engaged space and slams into the tooth behind in just the same manner. This can result in a VERY frustrating experience.So now we get to the issue with the lens. The focus adjustment has a noticeable backlash problem which becomes evident at the very highest magnification of the EOS 40D's live preview.I recently took a picture of a small creature (about 50 thousandths of an inch across) on the wall of my salt water aquarium. I used live preview, max magnification, and manual focus.Let me tell you, this was an experience of great disagreement between the lens and me. I spent literally ten minutes trying to get the lens to the best possible focus.I would touch the lens ring, and the focus would get sharper, and then frustratingly, slide right past that setting to slightly blurry again. I'd then adjust the other way, and the same thing would happen again the other way.The camera was on a tripod, it was orthogonal to the plane the object I was trying to focus on was attached to, the object was agreeably motionless - all the recipe ingredients for an easy to focus situation. Except we are talking about a VERY small object, and so very fine focus control is required.Is this going to bother you in your application? Probably not, unless you shoot very tiny things, as I do from time to time. Even then, we're talking about trying to squeeze the very last wisps of focus accuracy the lens is capable of out of it.But after spending almost $500 on a lens, would you not want to get all you can out of the optics? I know I do. If what you're shooting is moving, you could easily lose the best possible shot because the focus is just about uncontrollable in that last percentile or so.It is possible that I got a bad lens; perhaps others would be so good to check this out before they post their reviews. But I have to review the lens I have, because that's the experience I've had."
1904,"If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series.However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens.A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well.Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom!"
1905,"This is the worst product!!! It cuts out every other second. I can't believe I wasted my money on this, although it was cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
1906,"The item is not for a 14.1 widescreen, I have a Dell 6420 and it has a 14.1W screen but the item didnt fit.on the plus side.. the point was to stop people next to me looking at my screen, which is does well..well... for parts of the screen is covers."
1907,Awesome results...
1908,"I've had my headphones for 3 years.  I'm an amature DJ and could only recommend these for DJ use.1st of all, the major complaint about these headphones are the cracks that appear on the swiveling brace.  Face it, it's plastic and it can break.  And it's not the best design for durability.  But it's not gonna happen to everybody.  As a matter of fact, a lot of record stores with turntable sampling stations will have these headphones out for use.  A local record shop in HB had about a dozen of these headphones out for years of careless use.  I think, most people end up sitting on or packing them in heavy luggage.  I can't see how you can just put these on top of your head and break them.2nd, they're not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes.  They're designed to monitor the next song while listening to blaring 15"" club speakers.  A device with mediocre output voltage will not move these 50mm drivers well enough to get good sound quality.  So stay away from iPods.  They're just not gonna drive these headphones really well.  Imagine hooking up two 12"" subwoofers to your car and trying to power them with your headunit.  It's not gonna happen.  Like I said, these are specifically designed for DJ's.  I use a Vestax PMC-05Pro2 mixer and I get crisp, studio monitor quality sound.  Very transparent and smooth lows.3rd, as for the 50mm drivers.. these headphones are designed for accurate and distortion free playback at loud volumes assuming you have a clear and strong output.  There are other headphones out there that have 50mm drivers that are designed for moderate volume levels.  A lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers.  Usually, lower sensitivity will handle louder volume levels better but a higher sensitivity unit will sound more accurate at lower levels.  So if you're not using headphones to monitor songs at a concert or at a club, go and spend your money on something else."
1909,"This product works as advertized, but the plug won't fit into my iPhone with the case on. I had to trip some of the rubber around the plug so it would fit into my iphone and ipad with the cases on. Also keep in mind that the iphone and ipad have 4 conductor jacks so they can use headphones wih the volume controls. This adapter works, but you have to pull it out slightly to hear audio in both L&R sides. I don't recommend this for apple products."
1910,"Product was absolutely horrible, broke right out of the plastic and I never even got the chance to use it."
1911,This is probably the best one available and the only one I've seen that looks like it could be reversed if needed but it is a lot of money if you need many. If you only need one and want it be be the best possible forever connection than this is the one I would buy. If you are connecting many cables than the cheap ones work just as well.
1912,"quality...feel...sound..etc...all great...you'll pay a little more...but well worth it.....i hope they last!!  the sound quality, as well as the durability make this product a hit!!!"
1913,"All PowerShot A70 owners who've seen problems with the camera sensor (CCD) failing to function or exhibiting excess noise or other image distortion should take advantage of a recall. Canon will repair this widely seen CCD defect for free even if your camera is out of warranty.See the A70 support page on Canon's website or search for ""PowerShot A70 CCD failure"".[...]Unfortunately, Canon isn't making this offer conspicuous on its website and is not contacting customers proactively. I only learned of it on an independent camera review website.I had contacted Canon Support about terrible noise problems in photos I'd taken (often discovered only later, when reviewing photos on the computer), and at first they failed to reply, let alone inform me of the free repair program. After discovering the recall notice, I contacted them again to request free repair, and they've agreed to repair my camera.In other respects, I've been very happy with the PowerShot A70's features and performance, but not very impressed with some design defects and this CCD problem. The only mitigating factor with the CCD defect is that several other manufacturers' cameras have been affected by the same problem, though they've dealt with their customers better in addressing it. Olympus offers to repair cameras with CCDs that may be defective, regardless of whether the camera is currently exhibiting problems.This issue, combined with a Canon camcorder that is now unreliable due to a widely-seen recorder section problem, severely undermines Canon's reputation for quality. This is especially disappointing for me because I believe Canon's products are often functionally superior, and I previously had Canon film cameras that were bulletproof."
1914,The Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band is a great bang for your buck grounding strap. I've used it while assembling new computers or working on problem ones with no issues. A low cost necessity when working with electronics. The wrist strap adjusts nicely to different sizes and the clamp secures itself with no issues or slipping.
1915,"Probably my fault, but I was searching for 'retractable' earbuds and I found these - but they are not retractable.  Yes, you can hand wind them into the case, but that's no great trick.  Idea was to avoid clutter but when it is as much work to wind them up as it is to untangle ones without a case, why bother?"
1916,"This is a universal control by Sony. Theoretically, once programmed, you can put away the sea of remotes you have and do it all with this one.The Good:Has learning remote function when the preset numbers don't work for your component.Has physical buttons for channel up/down, volume up/down, and menu navigation - and they can be reprogrammed.Looks professional.Used ones are cheap and Sony has a downloadable manual online.The Bad:The manual is poorly written and badly organized - It is a bad learning curve to set the remote functions.The learning function can be idiosyncratic requiring you to dim the room lights and try many times for some functions.The default LCD contrast comes barely readable and even when optimized is unreadable without the backlight.The characters are pretty small on the LCD ""button areas""Neither my Sony BluRay DVD nor my fairly old Sony A/V unit worked with any of the factory codes.The really bad - If you wait too long to change the batteries you may lose all the programming!One more recommendation - If your significant other is as non-technical as mine, buy a very simple, big buttom, TV remote control for them to use. It will save both of you a lot of frustration."
1917,"These ear buds aren't the loudest, but they also are far from expensive.  Their wind up case is nice, and they carry the famous sennheiser build quality.  I highly recomend these to whoever doesn't want to get robbed on the street for wearing white ear buds."
1918,"While it's not a very fast lens, one will be hard-pressed at finding one with as wide of a focal range and as quiet of a motor as this one at this price. I've shot with this lens in a church and I couldn't hear it focus even then. Images could be a little sharper, but I'm not complaining. I highly recommend it!"
1919,"The cables them selves feel nice. The 1/8&#34; jack is good, but the 1/4&#34; side is kinda of funky. I need to twist them around in the jack to get a good signal. Not sure if theres some weird coating on them or what. But once they are going they work good."
1920,"I've had the same pair for 5 years. Here is all you need to know...1. They are durable.-I put them in my backpack with huge math books every day for school.-I have spilled coffee on them.-I have kicked them, and pulled on the cord with my feet by accident.-My fat friend stepped on them.-They have dealt with volume spikes and loud sounds.After all of this they look and work perfect.2. They sound great!-I own a pair of 8"" studio monitors, professional stuff. These don't sound quite as accurate, but I still choose UR20's over my monitors a lot of the time, and enjoy the UR20's immensely.They are durable and sound great, what more could you want? :DPlease rate this review as helpful, otherwise, leave a comment letting me know how my review could have been more helpful. Thank you!"
1921,"I gave these headphones a five star rating because the sound is very clear.  You get good separation and a feeling of spatial separation and distance.  They work great. They are comfortable.  It's just too bad I can't use them.I bought these because other reviewers extolled the virtues of these headphones for sealing out the noise of their busy offices.  Any headphone can drown out surrounding noise.  Be warned.  These are not well sealed. The Sony product manual packed with the MDR-V600 headphones cautions customers not to disturb those close by.If you also got the impression that these ""closed"" headphones would allow you to listen privately you will be disappointed.  I work in an office doing data entry.  I like to listen to wild profane and controversial stuff and I don't want people listening in. These headphones would disturb my colleagues if I used them at work.  You can hear them clear and loud even when pressed firmly together.Nobody I work with wants to hear The Sex Pistols sing The Good Ship Venus.  So as good as the MDR-V600's are the little headphones that came with my player are better because I can crank them up and only I can hear them.  Too bad because these are so much more comfortable.Also I should mention I got ""refurbished"" MDR-V600 headphones.  The screws that hold them together do not all match some are silver and some are black.  Then it probably goes without saying that they are made in China not Japan."
1922,"Pro'sIt's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15"" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.Con'sNo compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry.I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon.The zipper ""teeths"" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop."
1923,"I bought these after a lot of research and I am glad that I did, one of my co-workers actually got the more expensive MDR 7506 and we ended up doing a side by side sound test.  We played some FLAC files through VLC using the Focusrite USB 2i2 DAC and though they both sound good on their own, you can clearly tell that the 7506 is coloring the sound significantly.  Also, the bass response on these seems to be better as well.Some people have complained about the comfort of these and I have worn them for hours on end while working and have found them to be incredibly comfortable.  I might enjoy the new ear pads because they supposedly help improve the sound quality, if/when I do I will update this to see if the combination is worth the hassle/money.All in all amazing headphones especially considering the price, you cannot go wrong with these."
1924,"This is a nicely packaged unit which is relatively easy to program.  Unlike some remotes, it is shaped so that you can rest it on your leg while sitting, and it will stay, due to the shape of the bottom of the device.  It also can be placed on a flat surface and has just enough 'tilt' so it can be read easily.  The only issue is that I found the display a little dificult to read due to the limited contrast.  I found I had to use the backlight even in the daytime, but it still wasn't that legible."
1925,Bought this one to fit my larger lens.  It's amazing how many people don't understand that the polarization is only effective when shooting with the sun to either side.
1926,"One year ago, 03/2010, I was happy and was able to get wireless internet service but was unsure of which router to purchase, this product was recommended to me.  WHAT A MISTAKE! I did nothing but complain on how my ""dial-up"" was faster and thought it was my computer. This March 2011 had a FOURTH (4) computer technician check it out and surmised the router was defective! Problems were solved after I had purchased another router, now I can see how nice an experience fast internet is. Hope no one else has to go through the headaches and expense I encountered."
1927,"I got the harness, and found the little plastic bag. Instead of metal rings it had four sort of T-shaped tabs. I couldn't figure it out, so used short strips of nylon cord to make the connection. Absolutely no help from Amazon or Nikon, and I checked the Nikon site. Other than that, the harness looks fine and should work like the ones we got from Mass Audobon some years back."
1928,"While it's true that someone sitting next to you on a plane would have difficulty seeing your screen, it's not hidden from people sitting behind you or people walking down the aisle, etc. It simply obscures the vision for someone sitting alongside of you. If that person's seat is back and you are forward, they will see a bit more than if they were directly parallel to you so that if they lean their seat back, they will have line of sight from behind you. So, for privacy, I give it a 3.The other issue is the ability to remove it once you place it on. There are two systems for attaching the screen to the laptop, one is permanent, with double sided tape, and the other should allow you to attach and remove it via creating channels with plastic stick on tabs. The problem is that it's really difficult to slide the screen in and out of the tabs without doing some damage to the screen or tabs. On my laptop the side tabs stay in place but the bottom tabs fall off, so that the screen is usually on an angle.I don't know that there are any filters out there that work better to protect your privacy; this is a nice, thick, well made and durable screen. However, there must be filters that attach with a better method."
1929,"These rca cables are well made and don't seem cheap to me.  However I do feel like they are very stiff and personally I like cables to have a more supple feel to them.Perform as advertised, nothing more to say really.  Weird color, the grey and orange but I like it."
1930,Unfortunately I could not use it. The hard drive went wrong. So I can not say much about. I did not had the opportunity to fully tested but good to have in a door in case the opportunity presents itself again.
1931,"I am using the iTrip made for the old model of iPod.  I have found it very difficult to get good sounding music on this thing.  I am used to using the iRock (a battery version with only 4 stations) for long drives.  It works much more reliably and the sound quality has been excellent.  Even when the iTrip works the sound is often distorted at normal volume-- noises from base and unclear sounding.  When I drive really far from even a small metropolitan area the sound clears up, but I have much better reception with the iRock."
1932,"I have a laptop without PS/2 ports so I needed a USB hub to connect an external keyboard (MS Natural Elite) and mouse (MS Optical Wheel Mouse).  Unfortunately, the mouse freezes for a complete second during high CPU times (about every ~1-10 minutes).  I bought a much smaller SIIG USB 2.0 mobile/notebook hub (not the &quot;mini hub&quot; one which is bigger), and it doesn't have these problems.  With the SIIG, you don't have to use the AC adapter, unlike the D-Link."
1933,"...occasionally bits of memory mysteriously disappears.  For example, of my daily mileage tabs for the past six months, November's mileage records have inexplicably vanished, though this month's (December 02) mileage records are intact.  This happened to me a while back with September's mileage records, but they inexplicably reappeared a few weeks later!  I'm hoping the same will happen to the missing November records...This is my first PDA, so have no idea if this is just a fact of life with all PDAs or what.Other than that this PDA is more than enough for my needs, no need to blow $300-500 for some fancy schmancy full-color 400 MHz (same as an old Pentium II desktop!) HP or Sony running Pocket Windows, which is actually not as easy to use as Palm OS."
1934,The Labtec verse 524 desktop mic actually work for a cheap product it is made of all cheap light and very breakable plastic if you handle this item without care it will fall apart and it does produce sound but it is very tiny you wil have to scream into it for it to record loud sound but when you do that all you hear is this static and loud hissing noise this mic in my opinion is not worth the money even though it is already cheap as dirt.
1935,I bought these headphones to use at home and at church.  I am involved in the multimedia ministry at my church and these really do a great job.  You won't be disappointed if you get them.
1936,"It's a buy for the money. But does not connect to my Mac steadily, which needs frequent restarting of  my Mac. Finally, I had to buy a USB keyboard. So am not happy with its reliability."
1937,"I've been buying these cables in various lengths from Amazon for the past several years and have NOT had any issues with any of them, and the fact they're cheaper PLUS free shipping (Prime Member) makes this an even better deal.  Thanks Amazon!!"
1938,"The headphone connection is of limited value. My first use of it was a bummer. The headphones had a pronounced whine when I plugged them into the headphone jack on the unit. I could 'drown the noise out' by turning up the volume, but obviously the unit needs a redesign to add some damping or filters to kill interference from the alternator and spark plugs...With the above issue, I'd rate this as an expensive auto charger with an almost worthless feature. (Are there simple car chargers for the iPod without the 'features' of this one?)With electronic filters it would get at least 4 stars, without gets it 2... (You can use the jack on the iPod for headphones and volume control)It does feel a little cheesey. Probably 'cause it's made in China... The bulbous end of the lighter adapter part glows and shows the 'Belkin' name... Self promotion is not needed or appreciated... Also the cable comes out of the side of the DC adapter plug. An interesting choice. At least that part is well thought out except for the running of 2 cables from the unit. One from the iPod to the adapter and one from the adapter to your headphones...Actually the more I think about it, the amplifier really becomes a fairly worthless addition, in spite of the noise... Just an ordinary car adapter would work because you could charge your iPod while listening to it through the iPod's headphone jack. The only thing that is easier with this adapter is that the volume control is on the DC plug and is a 'normal' rotating wheel... The cables kept getting caught on the seatbelt and my coat... Annoying while driving...Not a 'stellar' product, but maybe the only game in town..."
1939,"500 feet of speaker wire is a really, really large amount of speaker wire. It seemed like a good idea when I ordered it. Less so when I lugged the nearly demolished box off my front porch, where some poor UPS driver had to drag it from his truck. I've wired up my living room and barely made a dent in this beast. Do the math before you decide that you need 500 feet of speaker wire. I wish I had."
1940,"These headphones fit well and are much better than the ear bud styles.  Those never stay in place.  I also like how they collapse, and are therefore much more portable to take the gym.The downside I have experienced is these phones have lasted me about 90 days and then stop working.I use them almost daily on the treadmill and can feel the sweat building up.  It appears that the sweat eventually shorts out the earphones.I do like these headphones for overall performance and cost.  I keep several on hand, knowing they won't last very long.  My issue is they unexpectedly stop working, usually in the middle of my workout, and must finish my workout on the treadmill in silence.I will try the behind the head version as well."
1941,"They were great.  However, the wire near where they plug in is poorly made because when I touch it, bump it, or it gets pulled or twisted every so slightly, the audio cuts out.  I got these at the end of July and now it is the end of August and I've only used them about 1-2 times a week (so a total of 8 times tops) and they are already not working."
1942,"I am %100 satisfied with this purchase.  If these disappeared, I would buy a replacement set immediately.The build quality is top notch, much better than you'd expect from the photo.  Other headphones have chinsy hinges, or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well, but when you feel these in your hands, you will know that they will last.  The cord and plug are both pro grade also.The audio quality is great.  Are there better sounding phones?  maybe.  I've had some very expensive Sennheisers, Sonys, a few random off brands and a pair of Grados, all which sounded great.  These Sony's hang with them.  If you can find a pair that sounds better, that pair will be $500, and it won't blow these Sony's out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details.Comfort is good.  The foam goes fully around your ear(circumaural) and they are a closed can design so they &#34;block out&#34; outside sounds.  They aren't &#34;noise isolating&#34; or &#34;noise reducing&#34;, but they block enough to put you in your own audio space.  If you listen with these, you won't hear the phone ringing in the other room.  If you have sweaty ear syndrome or don't like headphones that are closed, these might not be up your alley.  That is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones.  I personally really like the closed, circumaural design.  The band and the ear pressure are exactly right.  In ten years, after you've worn through the ear pads, replacements will still be readily available online.Overall, these are the industry standard for a reason.  Time tested, excellent quality, unbeatable value.  Buy these headphones, you will be satisfied with them for sure."
1943,"I use the mouse alot, and have been having increasing pain in my right hand, so I purchased this mouse hoping it would ease all the pain.  I used this about 30 minutes, and it hasn't helped the pain at all, in fact, my hand usually doesn't get this fatigued until 3-4 hours, but with this one, just using it 30 minutes has put me in great pain and hand fatigue.  The issue is in the grip I believe.  Also, you have to move your whole hand, not your wrist, which means that even if your hand didn't hurt, your shoulder and upper arm will get sore from using it alot. One good thing though is that you will probably build muscles and you will burn more calories just sitting at your desk.  :-)"
1944,"I bought this to communicate with my Garmin Rhinos (models 120 and 130).  Despite the fact that no modern computer comes with a serial DB9 connector anymore, Garmin is still shipping Rhinos that come only with a DB9 connector.  (Shame on Garmin!)Anyway, I have both a Macbook laptop OS X 10.5 and also an HP running Windows Vista 32 bit Ultimate.  I loaded and installed the drivers correctly.  (For Mac you have to download them from the TRENDnet web site as the drivers are not included on the CD according to their manual - what's up with that?)Vista at least could see the USB to serial device plugged in, but the Garmin Webupdater software could not see the Rhino devices on the other end of the cables - on either Mac OS or Vista.  I called TRENDnet technical support and spoke to them for about 20 minutes.  They were very helpful, but alas were unable to get it working and agreed my best course was to return the USB to serial converter to Amazon.Other reviewers are quite fond of this converter, so it obviously works for other devices.  My comments and negative review, clearly, should therefore be restricted specifically to the Garmin Rhino GPS radios.  But for them, with this converter, you're out of luck."
1945,"I might of gotten a bad battery. This thing would not hold a charge at all. Showed it took 100%, then when used the next morning it was empty.  Again it might have just been the batch but this one is no good."
1946,"works well with keyboards but not very well with cell phones very difficult to link up.Device has not been updated for windows Vista. Worst purchase I have made so far, have set aside not using anymore, customer support from manufacturer, not good at all."
1947,It was cheap and it worked and that is all I could ask.  A little long for my use but that's OK.
1948,"I bought this for my office because my old cord kept tangling up on me.  I also wanted a longer one.  The length on this one is great, but it tangles up just the same as the old one did.  I wish I could find one that does not tangle.  It is a pain."
1949,"I have had this camera for about 4 yrs now - I take it on all my business travels.Whenever I get a chance to go out on on the weekends, I take this camera and my Sony camcorder in my backpack, roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures.  The pictures that I shoot from this camera are just awesome - no matter whatever experiment I do with it.Most useful features:1. Aperture control with Depth of field preview- Lets to focus the foreground and blur the background2. Shutter speed control upto infinity- Lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open3. It is pretty rugged, dont try dropping it :) I have used it to shoot pics from 'Maid of the mist' in Niagara falls and I almost thought that I was going to lose it.  But it worked liked a charmNegatives- Bulky, but you will get used to it, it always gets attention- Cost of developing film - What I do these days is to just get the photos on a CD, then develop only those photographs that are good.Why is this camera better than a Digital Camera ?- If you are spending $200 on a Digital Camera, I feel that the SLR is way far too ahead of any Digital camera in that price range- If you are spending $1000 on a Digital Camera, a Digital SLRs are very mature today - worth buying.Ideally, I would buy this SLR, take this whenever I really want to take good photographs, then I would also want to have a $100 Kodak Digital Camera for casual shots.  This would mean an ideal combination.If you are buying this SLR, you can also consider buying a Film/Photo scanners (available for less than $150 now) - which lets you scan the negatives/positives without even going for a cheap CD print.  From the reviews what I read on amazon, these scanners must be amazing."
1950,"I cannot even begin to express my frustration with this product. My iBook received fairly ""light duty"" tasks, and most of the time I used it at a desk, not moving it, and it has only been on two trips with me. The other day I heard a POP sound, and noticed that the adapter's light was not on. It blew out, or something...who knows. The exact same thing had happened to someone else I know who has an iBook. Also, everything I see online seems to complain about how the cord rips/tears, and how the thing is just flimsy.In the end, if you need a replacement, and you want it to be the apple brand...I at least recommend buying it on amazon, because the price here was a little bit lower than a few other places I checked.No sense paying even more for a useless piece of junk."
1951,"I bought a privacy screen for my new work laptop a few months back. This is the second 3M filter that I have purchased (the first didn't fit my new laptop). The screen works fairly well. Depending on the angle someone is sitting and the amount of light in the room, your screen may be visible to others. Obviously, if someone is sitting behind you or over your shoulder, they can see your screen.I know that there are other products out there that probably do a better job, but my own personal experience is that the 3M product works well enough for my needs. It is rather expensive though. If this weren't reimbursable, I would likely not purchase one."
1952,"My rating is in strict relation to the retail price.For $120 it's zero stars, for $100 it's one star, and so on. For $20 it would be five star rating. The $120 tag price is unjustified.THE GOOD:The radio is relatively small and good-looking; it has its own elegantly simple style. It is offered in a variety of well-matched colors. The heavy wooden box (4 sides only) does have its appeal and helps it sound more like an ""adult"" radio. The tuning dial mimics precision instruments and has a nice feel to it. Jacks for auxiliary audio, external power supply and antenna come handy. The sound is pleasantly deep, and if one finds it too much, it can be dampened with a ball of tissue squeezed into the bass port (in the bottom) or with a piece of duct tape plastered over the hole.THE BAD:Price is outrageously high; at $120 retail you don't get even a half of what you pay for. It is made in a large Asian country famous not so much for quality as for super cheap labor; and at this price it could be happily made in USA. The FM reception is very average and AM is outright bad. The analog tuner tends to drift over time. The tuning dial is off a few degrees. The switch is hard to turn. It's not stereo - at this level of fancy at least the phone jack could be stereo. The speaker outputs a continuous low-level hissing noise even when the volume is turned all the way down. I tried connecting external DC, but it doesn't eliminate or lower the hiss.THE UGLY:I bought the Model One radio for a friend in Europe and intended to replace transformer in the power supply to make it compatible with 240 VAC. When I opened the radio I found a lot of rust on the few metal parts inside. It was ugly and cheap. In fact, I haven't seen anything that ugly in any other new radio. With so much rust it would probably fail in a short time. I sent for a replacement and the second one had the same hissing problem but was OK rust-wise.Recommended? For $20-30 with no rust inside - yes!"
1953,GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.
1954,"I have had this lens and have used it maybe 2x, the lens will not focus, makes clicking noises... I absolutely hate it!"
1955,"ASIN B00008VF5W - The space in the store that used to hold portable cassette players has been given over to portable CD and MP3 players, so shopping online made great sense. Until I got the player, anyway. Then it started to look like a very stupid idea.There's no rewind button on this player. (I wasn't expecting it, but in case you are, it also has no recording capability.) You can fast forward, play and stop. If you want to rewind, you have to stop the tape, flip it over, fast forward, stop, flip it over and play. If you've not gone far enough, repeat. This is tedious and annoying and, worse, not mentioned in the product description.This is a cheaply made player, which is a negative; it weighs next to nothing, which is something of a positive! Another plus is that it comes with both earbuds and headphones - which I promptly threw away because earbuds hurt my ears and headphones and baseball hats just don't work together. I usePhilips HS430 Lightweight Clip-On Headphones. But it was still nice that the player came with both and you'll probably appreciate them more than I did. The radio function works fine for me, but only because I only use it for baseball games that are all on AM. I flipped through the FM stations and got more static than music.If you're looking for a cheap player that doesn't need to last long, this one is fine, really. The greatest negative in my mind is that there are going to be piles of these things in landfills - recycle yours when it dies! On the other hand, if you're thinking of keeping it around for a while, take a look atSony TCM-150 Cassette Recorder with Automatic Recording Level Control. It's bulkier and heavier but it's also sturdier, lasts longer and takes the same headphones - it even rewinds! (and records)- AnnaLovesBooks"
1956,"I bought a few of these Belkin Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable (10 Feet) for our office use. I bought them because they had a terrific price point. They were all shipped on time, they all came individually packaged, they all work great and as described."
1957,I've only tried it once on my 70-210mm telephoto and it definitely moved you closer to your subject. I took my pics on an overcast day and the focus ( which did work on auto) searched alot and sometimes never did achieve sharp focus. Picture quality is definitely degraded using the teleconverter with some fuzziness. I plan to try it again on a brighter day. It's a nice addition to my photo tools but not sure how much I'll use it. I like crisp clear photos.
1958,"Good, as maxell usually is. Handy to have 3.5mm adapters for modern equipment andn1/&#34; for intage stereo. Useul for even longer cord headphone"
1959,"When I plugged this puppy in, I immediately heard noise in the line. It leads me to believe that the quality of the connectors used is sub par."
1960,Bought a 50 pack and the first three wouldn't work in 2 different macs so I just plan on returning the lot and getting some Imations instead
1961,The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the connection clips seem a little odd or fat. It is now stuck in my cable modem and I can't get it out. Otherwise the cable is stiff and beefy so I assume it is providing me with a good signal.
1962,"This card is great when it works (once you get the drivers and firmware up to date, anyway), but seems to be prone to problems. I bought two of these cards originally, for two different laptops (one a Gateway, the other an IBM, both running Windows XP). All of a sudden, one laptop started rebooting spontaneously sometimes, then sometimes locking as Windows XP restarted, and sometimes it wouldn't turn back on at all. I was baffled by it until in desperation I tried popping the card out, and all of a sudden no more problems. I swapped the card with the other one and the exact same problems migrated to the other laptop. I called D-Link and they cross-shipped a replacement card (though it took most of a month to get it), which worked fine for a month and now seems to be causing the same problems again. I won't be buying another one of these."
1963,"changing the compartments inside is more difficult than indicated, and space is at a premium..."
1964,"and comparable wire at brick and mortar store was twice the price, plus a knowledgeable sales person could not be found, outstanding  performance, low cost equals the very best deal."
1965,More than 60% of these discs fail when attempting to write them. I'll never buy Sony CD rom discs again. This is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading.
1966,"For this price they are very good. They are boomier than the Koss porta pro but they completely cover the ear.really well for watching movies or TV. Musically, they are fine just not as clean as the Porta-Pros."
1967,"We use several of the bluish ones since years, as the current image is.These felt stable and durable. Zero problems, great quality.The new one arrived this week, it is black and the enclosure feels kind of cheap. My initial thought was I send it back, not fully decided yet.So far we have nothing than good results with the old version.I wish that Amazon would update the images.Edit: I kept the new version and it is working just fine, I have four disks on it, and two card readers. I work with it 7 days 12 hours with it. No problem."
1968,"I picked this up when i ordered a NAD integrated amp with only one set of speaker outputs.  I currently have 2 pairs running but plan on another pair for the master bath and I'll be set since this Monster set can run 4 pairs.The unit came pretty fast, and upon inspection I could see that it was built to a lower price point than what is typical for Monster, but that's not a bad thing as much of their gear can be quite pricey.  The speaker inputs on back are not designed for anything bigger than 14 gauge, and the manual suggests using gold pin connectors on wire larger than that.  Currently you can get a set of 4 pairs of Monster Gold Angled Pin connectors for 7 bucks on Amazon, but don't get banana plugs, they don't fit.  I started by making sure my amp was indeed off. Never make ANY connections with your gear on, it can damage sensitive circuits.  Upon inserting my 14 gauge wire, I found it a tight fit, but by twisting or rotating the wire as I pushed it in, it was fine with no loose strands.  Loose strands can cause a short if long enough, clip any you see, and take your time on this, you are not in a race, and doing it carefully will give you years of service.Monster could have used bigger or better speaker connectors here, small spring clips are not exactly the best.  But it's a small unit and to accommodate big 5 way binding posts would have required a much bigger back plate which would mean a much bigger case all around.  More expensive to build, so I'm fine with the size and the price, some may not be.So after making all the connections, I tested it out and have been very happy with the sound.  It has circuitry that a) connects multiple pairs of speakers to your amp in parallel and b) adds some form of resistance to each channel to maintain 8 ohms for your amp as 2 ohms would be dangerous for most amps or receivers.  I wondered if this Monster model would change or color the sound when it added load but the sound remained untouched, albeit with slightly less volume easily compensated for.  For running a single pair, you disengage the circuitry by pushing a button, and 2 or more pairs requires you to depress said button to engage this circuitry.  Pretty easy way to protect your gear, I've been just leaving the protection circuitry on as there are no issues this way.For the money, this model is an excellent option to run speakers in different rooms or zones."
1969,"I bought a C-740 3 weeks ago. Very nice camera, got the controls figured out, took about 100 photos. Really like the long optical zoom. At some magnification, the 740 has the impaoct of a >6Mpixel CCD because of the excellent lens.One HUGE problem just discovered though. The Camedia Master (and Pro option) software stinks! It looks like poorly done software from an asian source. Worst of all, the Olypus softrware cannot print to any networked printer. Every one of my other Windows applciations work just fine over the net. Olympus says, ""Gee, were sorry"" and that they have no plans to fix this major error.If you need to use this camera at the office or home with a printer that is not directly connected to your PC, pass on Olympus and look for another manufacturer! The problem is endemic to all Olympus cameras!"
1970,"When I first put them on I loved the fit, they were light weight.... then when I plugged them into my Ipod, the right speaker was much louder than the left, So I turned the cable back and forth at the bottom of the Ipod and the speakers snapped, popped and went out completely, then came back on. So you have to get the cord just right to have both speakers working. Don't bother with them, I cant believe ""Sony"" would make such a cheap pair of headphones. I'm going to have to get another pair."
1971,"Sony MDR series headphones been always one of the best, no wonder many professional studios are using it! I use mine to play guitar at late and don't bother the neighbors. Once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced [B001DFX2OC"
1972,"Needed this for older Raymarine electronics in order to perform software upgrade. Worked like a charm, typical excellent quality from SanDisk. Make sure this is what you need before ordering."
1973,"FYI...  I have hacked my nomad with a 20GB harddrive.Things I Love:Every CD I own is on the nomadYou can copy data files to itYou can do live recordings with itThings I Wish Were Better:I wish I could just use this as a USB harddriveI wish the batteries didn't run out so quicklyI wish it was smallerI have had nothing but a good time with my nomad.  Creative had some issues with the operating system on this thing when it first came out, but not too many big issues left to deal with.  There were some people who had trouble with the hardware and batteries, but I wasn't one of them.  I bought this...so even if I hated it I would like it, just because it cost so damn much."
1974,"I bought these after reading the Amazon reviews. The sound through the headphones is good. However, the fit with any of the three different size rubber earbud covers is awkward and the earbuds fall out of my ears when running or biking or weightlifting. Of course, all ear shapes and sizes are different, but I would strongly recommend you attempt to try these for size elsewhere before ordering online."
1975,"I'm an International DJ doing Trance, Rave, D&B, Ambient, and Dubstep. I've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me. No matter how hard the bass drop, No matter how long a Trance chorus, They've never popped a speaker and never quit. If you're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these. Armin Van Buuren doesn't use them for no reason, and other Professional DJ's know where its at; Sony MDR-V700's."
1976,"I wanted to refute what I've read on here about these being for DJ use. I couldn't disagree more. I hate dance, rap and anyting to do with a club or DJ. These phones are excellent for rock or anything i've tested them on. Tried out Hendrix, Floyd, Zeppelin, Metallica, Megadeth, Marley, Janes Addiction, Maiden and more and I have absolutely no complaints. I can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin' good it blows me away. I cannot compare the 7506's but may have purchased those if I had done more research first. You really can't go wrong with these. I can't speak for the durability but after reading the reviews I will not fold them up and plan on using them at home 95% of the time. The sound quality of these is astounding. Don't believe the negative rants...."
1977,For accurate sound reproductions these BIC DV62si speakers are the bottom of the pit.They are not accurate at reproducing the voice and midrange tones and are very loud on the tweeter end of the sound spectrum.I returned these to Amazon.com the next day after trying them when delivered.
1978,"The type of audio and songs that I listen to don't testify to the sound quality very much. But so far it's been a good facilitating tool. I recommend the audio accessories Belkins produces. I've had Belkins audio spliter, ipod rubber grip, and this and they all perform well."
1979,"What is with the crazy price on these things?  I have bought a bunch of them, my last order for seven pairs a little over two hears ago.  The current price is ***six times*** what I paid on my last order.  And it wasn't the first time that I had bought them; in fact, I think I had previously bought them even cheaper from (or through) Amazon.  It may sound like they are not very durable but that is not the case; they are fine in durability and excellent in sound.  I just have an unusual requirement and go through a lot of them.  Plus, they were so cheap, I felt I could keep a drawer-full around like flashlight batteries.And now this crazy price?  I reflexively give them a single star.  Actually, that may not be quite fair.  Their performance may be competitive with buds in this definitely-not-disposable price range.  But I'd need a very good explanation before I bought them at this price.  I think I will scout around a little and see how many stray pairs I have lying around."
1980,"I should know better . . .But in this case, I didn't . . .One look at this piece of Sheeeet in the trash it wentDO NOT BUY . . ."
1981,"I read one review that said ""Koss Warranty a Joke""I am not sure how the warranty is these days, but it used to be great.I bought a pair of ""Sear's branded"" Koss headphones so many years ago I can't even remember what decade it was. When I bought mine, there was a one year warranty.After several years of hard use, the cord messed up, one of the ear pieces had broken loose, and a couple of wires had broken from the ear pieces. All of this was my fault. I couldn't bring myself to throw them away, so I stuck them in the closet.Several years later (probably 15 or more years), when Koss announced the change in their warranty, I sent these things in (at my cost - didn't cost but a couple of bucks) hoping they could be fixed.Within a few weeks, I got my headphones back in like new condition. Koss paid for the return shipping. My headphones have to be at least 30 years old now, and still going stong. :)"
1982,"I bought these to listen to my new Sansa Clip and, yes, they sounded pretty decent, quite bassy and laid back but after listening to them for only a few minutes, I noticed my ears started ringing. These things are too tight and press the music into your ear canals and may be some of the worst headphones you can use when it comes to your precious hearing. I'm taking mine back tomorrow."
1983,"These were bought for my dad's computer.  He has an intergrated sound card, but the speakers sound great.The only thing i did not like is that the subwoofer is very over powering, and would sound awful from the other room.  And the subwoofer does not have a way of adjusting the bass, so it was stuck like that.The only way i could componsate for this is using a program with ajustable base.After that though they sound great."
1984,"I've already replaced this item once.  I love the headset but the lifter is weird.  My second unit failed today ... just like the first one did:  it just quit working.  So I started to do research on Google related to problems with it.  I also remembered seeing reviews on Amazon prior to our original purchase so I came back and read the three that were already attached to this procuct.  I was amazed at the July 2007 review that said GN Netcom tech support said to tap the unit on the side.  I did and it worked!  Needless to say, I laughed right out loud!  Evidently a sensor inside the unit is poorly engineered so that every once in awhile it hits a dead spot.  A little ""bang"" on the unit either wakes up the unit or gets the sensor off its dead spot.  Go figure.  This item has been around for awhile too, so I'm surprised it hasn't been reengineered.  Sounds like an insert should be put with the operating instructions saying, ""If unit stops working, bang it on its side.""Update (June 24, 2013).  I chuckle out loud every time I see another post related to this review.  Also want to say that I have ""fixed"" my replacement lifter multiple times since purchasing it."
1985,"I've owned two Escort Solo 2 radar detectors. I use them because they work well as radar detectors, are cordless, and have an earphone jack. I use the detector on a motorcycle, so must have an earphone jack. HOWEVER, the earphone jack is VERY delicate, and once it's damaged the unit emits no sound at all, with or without the jack plugged in. The first one I owned (and still own) has twice been returned to Escort for repair as the earphone jack has twice now come off the circuit board, rendering it soundless with or without the earphone jack. I imagine this will happen again in a few months with continued ear phone use. I bought a new Solo last week from Amazon, and within one day of use with the earphone jack, the jack and all external sound stopped. Amazon replaced it, and AGAIN within one day of earphone jack use there is no earphone or external sound. Back to Amazon (bless 'em) it goes, and I've ordered a Bel instead (also made, I might add, by Escort). We'll see. I like the  Escort, but once my old one comes back from repair it will get used only in my car and without use of the earphone. What's the point of an earphone jack, if the equipment is too delicate to handle it?"
1986,"I purchased this switch in November 2005 and seemed to significantly improve my network throughput. I've been purchasing Linksys products for years and have never had any problems from any of them.Like many I quickly found that the switches fan was quite loud. Since it was in a room with 5 or so computers, the noise didn't really bother me that much. The switch did its job and that's all I needed it to do.Over the past few months, the fan has gotten progressively louder with a pleasing rattling noise as well. Obviously, the fan was approaching the end of it's sad little life. Then last week, the loud fan noise ceased. The sad little fan had breathed its last. When I touched the case, I was astonished how hot the switch was running. Obviously, something needed to happen. There was a very real chance of fire.Now the real fun began.Yesterday, I placed a call to Linksys' tech support. After waiting on hold for 45 minutes, I spoke with a tech support person (Let's call him 29845). I was given a case number that was supposed to allow me to return the unit. Sadly, the number was rejected as invalid by the RMA ""support"" web site.Next, I tried their ""live chat"" ""support"" tool online. This time the wait was only 40 minutes and I spoke (typed?) with a very nice, but ineffective person (25174)who promised that I would be sent an email with a case number once I disconnected from the chat session. Of course, that number never came. Lovely. Another hour of my life gone.The next morning, I called the Tech support line. Joy! They picked up right away. I spoke with a gentleman named 43406 who was very nice, but was obviously not a deep thinker. He thought that it was very important that I needed to tell him who my ISP was and what my OS was before he could consider the issue with my bad fan. After a while it became apparent that he was in over his head, he placed me on hold so he could consult with his manager. After about 20 minutes, he picked up again, made some noises that sounded like he was scratching himself with the receiver then hung up on me.At this point, I was feeling very ""special""...I've never really ever had to deal with Linksys before for support issues. I'm not sure I have the constitution to ever try again.Their products are generally pretty good. Since I usually never need tech support, I'm usually pretty happy with their products. This type of ""support"" is appallingly bad though. They've wasted a couple hours of my life and left me rather disgusted.If you're willing to purchase any of their products, you should probably consider them throwaway items, because you're not likely to get ANY competent support from them."
1987,"It helps, but not nearly as much as I'd hoped.  The wire just gets inserted into the back of my receiver and I'm not convinced the ""connection"" is good enough to get the reception I want.  My car gets a bunch more stations than I can receive on my stereo in the house so this is a bit of a disappointment."
1988,"Because of the reviews I had to try these.  I am so NOT HAPPY with these and will send back.  The sound is NOT GOOD, and volume is low.  If you jack them up it can't handle it.  I honestly cannot believe you like the sound on these.  I love Koss but not these.  If you want a portable GREAT sounding set for about the same price, try Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones.  I have had 2 pairs for about 5 years or more.  One pair bit the dust but that is because I used them mowing and kept getting caught in my cord and pulled it one to many times lol.The sound on these are deep rich and super.  I dearly love them.  The only downside to them is they do not fit close enough to the ear but work great under a bogen hat lol.  They do not hurt your ears at all with only tiny sound leakage.If you want to get a higher end FULL SIZE over the head pair get the SONY MDR-V6 for about $62.00. They are AWESOME!  Only bad thing to them is the heavy cord but your sitting anyway for those they are not portable.  I wrap them around my speaker, but I would use on a plane etc. also.If you guys think the sound is good on these your going to LOVE the above recommended!!!!"
1989,"For a $18 surge protector, I would expect this unit to have quality construction.  As soon as I opened the package, my whole house reeked of a terrible cheap plastic smell.  I have to believe this is bad for your health.  The smell is akin to the cheap Spectre TVs Costco used to sell.  Functionally it seems to be ok, but if you are sensitive to smells I would not recommend this product."
1990,"For the price, these headphones are very hard to beat in terms of sound and comfort. I highly recommend them."
1991,I don't have a radio in my truck so I bought this to have something to listen to while driving but it seems to have alot of static noise on every channel.
1992,"They been making these the same way since before I was born and they haven't changed a thing.  After years of loyal service I finally abused my pair to death and I wouldn't order any other headphones to replace them.  They're lightweight and I often forget I'm wearing them. They do great bass simulation and I can hear instruments I can't detect on other headphones.  There are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers.  It has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated 80's design is kinda ugly.  They have no noise cancellation, so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume, and for something called the Porta Pro, they aren't particularly portable.  They fold up, but they don't fit in your pocket.  Still,  you can't find a better lightweight pair of  headphones in this price range. They work great and except for the occasional hair snag,  they're comfy,  but best of all they won't break the bank to deliver a quality sound.  Take the Pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets.  You'll see there's a reason they've earned a cult following."
1993,"Even though I saw more than a few negatives in reviews, I thought I would buy the Kensington Expert Trackball for my wife. She has some tendonitis problems and I thought this might be just the ticket. When she decided she didn't like it, I tried it on my computer. Here are our observations:Her pros: NoneHer Cons: The ball itself was too big for her comfort and the scrolling ring was terrible. Just did not like it in general.My pros: I like the large ball, but I have much larger hands and I found the whole ergonomic set-up very comfortableMy cons: For a mouse in this price range, I thought the whole thing seemed pretty cheap in feel. Everytime I downloaded the Trackball works onto my Windows 7 64 bit computer, it would lock up when I tried to open the program. Kensington Support was very helpfull though, they gave me a website with a different version and that worked fine. The scroll wheel is an abomination. As other reviewers have noted, it feels like it is moving on gravel and it does not operate smoothly.Returned it to Amazon this morning.My wife went back to her Logitech Trackman thumb wheel and I went back to my Logitech Trackball. They feel better and work better."
1994,"Not much to say as a hub - does exactly what it says on the tin.  Got it running on a Macbook laptop without AC power without any problems.Only think to watch is those 'fast charge' ports - they only work when the hub is disconnected from the laptop or the laptop is off, which seems pretty pointless to me."
1995,"Hard to tell if this is truly needed, but it's a cheap insurance policy.  Used for video card installation and will use for new memory upgrade on my desktop system."
1996,"The reason I got these was to listen to some music on while using my riding mower. I guess the original main purpose for these headphones was to be able to communicate in loud environments. The mids and highs are pretty good...the lows seem to drop off around 200 cycles. I've compensated somewhat with the equalizer on my ipod touch, but, I can never get a truly deep bass.The bottom line...for my needs (bouncing around on a riding mower) they work good enough. The cord is too long and bulky (I'm considering shortening it). The fit is fine...especially if you want to wear a hat. The volume control is a major plus. With decent bass they would have been great."
1997,"Okay, I realize I didn't pay a mint for these things, but they're Koss, so I thought they would be ""better"". The sound is pretty decent if your willing to hold them against your ears. The clips seem to hold the speakers too far from your ears, so it ends up sounding ""tinny"". The clips tend squeeze your ears after a period of time, and it begins to hurt. Short periods tend to be okay, but after a time, it's painful. Overall, I'm not impressed and wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
1998,"I made the following mistake:  I read reviews and compared good and bad ones (number-wise and specifically).  When I got the USB to PS/2 converter I tried it in several configurations (different machines and keyboards).  Worked intermittently, maybe 10% of time.  Thought maybe I got a bum device.  When I re-read the reviews I realized the high rating reviews were almost all for a different device, mainly the USB TO RS232 converter.  Amazon just jumbles them all together since they are selectable on the same page.  Mostly bad reviews for USB-PS2 version.  Bummer!  The short part is, this fails to respond almost all the time.  Computer sees the converter in ""Hardware Devices"", but does not respond.  I advise you not to buy this in the USB-PS2 version.  Not worth even paying to send it back."
1999,"I'm not all that experienced with polarizers, but this one works well and is easy to handle (it turns easily and smoothly and stays in place). The only downside is that it is prone to lens flare (which isn't much a problem because for the polarizer to be useful you kinda need to be shooting at roughly 90deg to the sun). I do get the sense that a better polarizer would have a stronger effect, but I'm actually VERY happy with the pictures I get with this, so I'm not complaining.Overall great for the price. I'm sure there are better filters, but I'm happy with this one."
2000,"Paying only $6.99 for a 512mb stick of ram would be too good of deal; well it was, tried everything reseating, running on it's own and so on with the same results PC would not boot because of hardware failure - ram.Avoid cheap deals unless you can find someone out there that has high marks; which usually results in high standards."
2001,"I bought these and have used them mainly on flights.  They hardly work.  If you turn them off, you can hardly tell the difference from when they are on.  In fact, if the battery dies, you'll never notice.You do get a little less  noise from the seal of the earbuds.The wires are a complete mess."
2002,"I originally bought these headphones because I thought they might sound and feel better than my Sennheiser HDR-120s.  The Sennheisers are more expensive but they are wireless so I thought I might get an advantage out of wired.  I am no audophile, but I was hoping for an improvement.To my taste these are too tight, and the sound is not particularly good.  Maybe I just prefer Sennheisers but of my headphones I rate them as follows:1.  HD201 -- much better Sound **** Comfort **** Portability **2.  HDR120  Sound ***  Comfort ***  Portability N/A  Range ****2.  PX100  Sound ***  Comfort **** Portability ****3.  MDR-V150  Sound **  Comfort **  Portability **My 12 year old thinks the Sony's are fine and they may be a good cheap headphone for kids.The HDR201's were recommended on many sites, and I thank those reviewers for their advice they are my favorite headphones so far."
2003,"This is the 4th pair of these headphones. THE CONNECTOR PROBLEM has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat. The 6nit curls up into easily transported ball. I can, t imagine flying withojt them."
2004,"These are fine, but they're a bit thin for my tastes, and the female end has a habit of unscrewing. Still, the connection is usually very good with the ones that I've purchased. If you're going to use this (like we do) for in-ear monitoring when playing in bars, etc., I would opt to go with a thicker cable if I were doing it again."
2005,"It works on all of my machines except for the one running Vista. I could not find any compatible drivers. Other than that, it works great on my XP machine. Maybe I should stop using devices that require a COM port?"
2006,I've only used this a few times since I bought it so my review will be limited.  I'm still finding it difficult to get consistent results with this filter but from what I've read it's not unusual. With continued use I expect that at some point it will be 2nd nature.
2007,"It's no big deal to keep resetting the password in order to get wifi working, but it's a nuisance. More problematical: Having to put in my own password manually means I have to use a less randomized, easily remembered password instead of using the highly randomized passwords provided by the internal firmware.I haven't looked very deeply into the problem - there may be a simple fix I'd find if I RTFM - but it's not that great a hassle. It doesn't drop connections or slow down available bandwidth, so I'll give it 3 stars."
2008,"I bought these to use when playing electric guitar, so I don't disturb  my wife and neighbors with my bad playing..  I wanted something comfortable, durable, with a long cord.  These fit the bill perfectly.  They are well built, fold easily, and fit in a durable bag easily.  The sound quality is excellent.  I've heard static a couple of times when shifting the guitar, but that's not the fault of the headphones.  I have a medium sized head, and they fit me snugly but comfortably.  I can get a bit of nausea when using them, but not nearly as bad as some other headphones I've tried.I'm very satisfied with these headphones, they are well worth the price."
2009,"It's a good cable, nothing really all that special about it. My brother uses it when he practices bass, so it gets the job done."
2010,"The remote has a lot of built in codes, and worked well, but I stopped using it when I got Harmony 659.Unfortunately, this remote is very bulky and has little memory, which limits the learning function severely.  It can be programmed over the phone, but I have not tried that option.  I think, more memory for learning IR codes would make it a better product, but after trying Harmony, I am not going back to this remote."
2011,"CC Radio needs to get their S**t together and produce a radio that isworthy of the cost.  Sticky buttons, bad LCD readout, and poor customerservice.  Buy something else. Anything else. BL"
2012,"That is the question. One of the major reasons is to regain desktop space: this one does it. Another one, to save electricity, hopefully: can be argued in its favor too. Even the price plays in favor of the Cornea MP704B 17"" LCD Monitor, the best deal in flatscreens at the time we were shopping for one a few weeks ago. Now, one thing that this beauty doesn't do: display with cripsness. Unfortunately, in spite of following the guidelines provide to auto-tune it, etc. bold fonts in particular are very fuzzy, which is a one-way ticket to headache land. So, save yourself and do some more shopping. This sure is a bargain, but not a good LCD, unfortunately. In fact, we're returning it and settling for the loss of desktop space for now."
2013,I was seeing double looking through these binos.  That gave me a headache.  I had to close one eye in order to see anything clearly.  They are not what I expected.  I returned them as a damaged item.
2014,"After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase 2 of these.  When they arrived, 1 was defective - the ground light did not work and I had to return it. Generally I do not think they are as well made as some other reviews state. A couple of the 'inputs' feel like there is not a good contact when the plug is inserted. However, I am replacing the defective one and keeping the other because I like the protection warranties and I hope once in place in my home, they will do the job."
2015,"It works, it gets the job done. Well-made, but a little pricey for what you get. The strap could be 1"" - 2"" longer; it barely fit around my wrist."
2016,"Was a bit hard to get threaded when I first got it, but stays in place nicely and accomplishes what I bought it for"
2017,"Yes, it works for Xbox Live (the primary reason I purchased it).  However, as my friends and I found out this weekend, system link does not work through the WET11 (or at least not the games we tried - Ghost Recon and Halo).  This has been verified by several websites around the internet.I'm disappointed.  It works great for Live, so I'll keep it if I can't convince Linksys to give me a refund, but not being able to play system link when my buddy comes over is a bummer."
2018,"Product works. I still don't understand why escort does not offer a 90 degree adapter or plug for the connector that plugs into the detector itself. Generally this is right where the cords fail over time, due to the stress of the the hard bend in the cable.  My detector like most people's is above the power connector on the dash, and so there is a sharp bend in the wiring of this cord where it connects to the detector and then runs back down to the dash power connector plug. I will buy again as there are not other real options I know of, other than the hard wire kit I may entertain installing."
2019,"This is a review of the seller only, not the product. That is some good stuff.Amazon's quality has always been good and trusted. 3rd party sellers are a mix and most can't be trusted to get quality brand products. This time Amazon let my down, 2 of my cables were correctly branded. The third was not. It looks the same but is made from a cheaper manufacturer. All 3 were placed in the same order. The 3rd cable even has a different SKU sticker."
2020,"So many good reviews so I will keep it shortI have 2 models of Koss,Koss Porta-Pro (semi-open design, bass is plenty, light and easy on you ears) these are very comfortable and I am wearing them now :) Koss ProDJ100 (Closed design, a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy) I find I use these for gaming allot as well as Music and find them Very Clear :)"
2021,Fit well but did not sound great.  Cheap/generic headphones sound better but if your looking for fit vs. sound quality - they were okay.Would not recommend these.
2022,I use headphones for TV viewing so as to not bother my wife.  These over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear.  No pressure on my head.  Block out other sound excellent.
2023,... since they effect of a polarizer is difficult to duplicate in Photoshop. This one performs well at a good price so picked up a cooupleof different sizes for my lens collection in my new micro four thirds mirrorless system.
2024,"This device is actually manufactured by a company called Aten:...The initial drivers did have many problems, however; I was finally able to get the product to work on Windows XP.  I down loaded the ""make floppy"" driver for XP from the manufactures website.  Next, download the most recent windows 2000 driver and try and install it (yes, you have to download two separate drivers).  The Windows 2000 driver will prompt you for a file it can not locate, point to your floppy drive (location of XP driver) and it will install the XP driver.  If you check ""Device Manager"" you will first see a question mark prior to the install, after the install windows recognizes the device without a problem.  You can even go into advaced properties and then change the Com Port number to a lower number then 5 (the default).  It does seem strange that they don't have a simple fix for this, but at least I found a work around.Iogear has always filled a market nitch of specialized computing products, so I've come to not expect a lot of support, but all the products generally work and are of good bulid quality (they don't fall apart)."
2025,"I picked up an open-box of this system at Best Buy one evening and thought I'd made a steal.  Normally $500 I got it for $300 with some scuffs and damage, no big deal.  I brought it home and immediately plugged it in to test it out.  The sound was great on the radio but the DVD player failed to function!  After much fighting and hassle I googled the error I was getting, DVD H02.  I'm not suppoesd to post URLs in the review, so I'll just say to google ""panasonic H02"" (without quotes) for yourself and see what you find.  It's not pretty.  Panasonic DVD players consistently fail after 1 year of use and the repair bill is more than a new DVD player.  The problem is, this unit is linked together and can't be separated for components.  So if one thing goes, the entire system goes and you're out of luck.  Oh, and you'll also find that the fan in the subwoofer (where the amp is) goes very quickly and will ruin the amp if you don't repair it in time.The only really nice thing about this system are the speaker stands.  They are stylish and very convenient.In the end I returned the item the next day, got my money back, and bought a Yahama YHT-150 600 Watt 5.1 channel system without a DVD player.  My current DVD player already had a coax out for surround sound, so I ditched the ""complete system"" idea and went for a component system instead.  The Yamaha system is amazing, has _incredible_ sound, and if I want I can replace its speakers with nicer ones because the amp is not directly reliant on them.And no matter what you decide to do, always upgrade the speaker wire.  It will prevent amp over-heating and give your speakers a much better sound.  I needed about 75 feet to wire all the speakers in my medium size setup.  I chose to use 14 gauge wire."
2026,"Celestron's 40mm Omni is not a bad eyepiece but its field of view is almost 10 degrees less than Celestron's Omni 32mm eyepiece, so they both give approximately the same view except for an increase in magnification with the 32mm.  I purchased both of these and I never have any need to use the 40mm.  The 32mm is also cheaper."
2027,"Ok, I'll be honest. This is a decent set of 2.0 speakers (no subwoofer), and would be a good buy if they sold for $29.95 (or even $49.95). But they don't. And that's the problem.For $100 there are MUCH better products on the market. (I've done A/B comparisons with most of them, so I'm not just blowing smoke). Yes, most of them are 2.1 systems and come with a subwoofer. But a decent 2.1 system is no harder to set up than these speakers, and the sub - which just sits on the floor under the computer desk - is a non-issue.There are plenty of people who are happy to pay what Bose is asking for these speakers, and will never realize they're paying $50 just for the Bose brand. (Which is pretty funny because when you talk to REAL audiophiles, the Bose brand stands for overpriced products, lots of hype, tons of marketing money, and mediocre audio quality - across the board)."
2028,I bought this for a digital frame to download images...  then realized it's the exact same cord my PS3 uses to recharge controllers...  oh well.
2029,"I liked the charger, the plastic and metal and how they sit.  But they produced loud hissing noise even when not connected to a source.  Maybe I just got defected item ... I had to return them."
2030,"this multi zone switch is a solid, easy to set up, easy to use switch. they may be a little pricey, but you pay for quality."
2031,"At first appearance, the Hosa Right Angle adapter looks nice and sturdy. When in use though there appears to either be a design flaw or poor quality control - all the headphones I tried (around 6) all had connection problems - static, sound only on one side of the headphone, volume problems. If I fiddled with the headphone jack, twisting it in the adapter, the problems would go away, though if I jostled the adapter the problems popped up again, setting off another round of fiddling.I've seen the same problem in very inexpensive straight 1/4&#34; to 3.5mm adapters but at nearly $9 I was definitely not expecting it of the Hosa.Bottomline - there aren't many alternatives out there (if you want and angled 3.5mm adapter) and what there is costs much much more. Shop around and you can get this for @$4-$5 so buy two and hope one works."
2032,"Shipped promptly, as ordered and a good price. What more could you ask?Perhaps, you could ask for a vendor who cares enough about their reputation to nicely solicit an earned recommendation.Well, Action Packaged, Inc. you got it."
2033,"I find these headsets perfect for use on my home telephone.  It allows me to make phone calls while I'm doing other things, whether it's doing dishes, or typing on the computer.  The party on the other side never knows I'm using a headset, as the voice quality is perfect."
2034,"First up, let me say that the Netgear products I own (including these new switches) have been flawless so far and that I am an Amazon Prime customer and am normally very happy w/ Amazon but the situation with these rebates has me upset. NetGear has rebates on all kinds of gear right now (switches, routers, access points, etc.) and Amazon happily reports the ""price after rebate"" on their product sales page. What they don't tell you is that Netgear will only let you redeem two rebates, regardless of how much of their gear you bought or what kind. I'm not trying to scam anyone, I just want to get my items at the price that was advertised. $10 off an item that's only $40 to start with is a significant discount and was the deciding factor on purchasing this particular brand of equipment. Seems like a strange way to build brand loyalty... The price goes up as you purchase a third or fourth unit. Never again Netgear and Amazon, you could be a little more upfront too, maybe say (limit two) next to the rebate price."
2035,Nice arrangment of tools. Didnt give it 5 Stars because the screw driver handle is little bulky. But that's not a big problem really.
2036,Bought the wrong size and had to return the product. Other then that I'm sure it would have worked fine. I only gave it one star because it didn't fit my product.
2037,"Dry tip, ineffective.  I figured it would have had to have some kind of wet solution inside it to wash smudges.  All this thing does is smear the dry black gunk that comprises the polishing tip.  I got no benefit out of this item whatsoever."
2038,This signal booster worked well when I first got it and my cable company had both analog and digital signals. When the cable company changed the signal to digital it no longer worked as well and I had to replace it.
2039,The gauge of this cable was not specified and it turned out to be much more than my system could use.
2040,"I have an old Microsoft Natural Multimedia keyboard I'm very attached to. Sadly, my new computer does not have a PS2 port, so I bought this so I could still connect it.Big problem: It's slow. I set my keyboard delay to the smallest value possible, but it still doesn't work with this adapter. Press if you press and hold a key, it pauses, stutters, the goes. I'm going to have to replace this item as it does not let me scroll or navigate smoothly and quickly with my keyboard."
2041,Nice price for these. When I opened the box up I found that one of the cases was broken:-(
2042,"Great buy!! I read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones.  They are as described. Sounds crispy and I think it gets better as you use them.  Very good isolation, despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing.  Frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too. Excelent ratio quality-price."
2043,"Okay, this is an edited review.  I thought the volume on these was atrocious, but actually I didn't see the volume switch on the chord (which I must say doesn't exactly stand out) and it was set to ""Min"".  So my real rating would be 4 or a 5.  In terms of value, definately a 5.The sound range is great, the comfort is quite good, the earbuds might be slightly too big in terms of comfort, but I guess that makes them not fall out as easily.  I like that the lengths of the two wires to the ears are actually equal (I don't know what idiotic product designer thought it would be a good idea to start that trend of having one be short and constantly tugging at my ear).  The windup function, though nothing new to the market, is also a convenient function for me since my old ones would always get tangled up in the front pocket of my backpack.edit 2: Not the most durable earphones, I seem to replace them every couple of years, but they're cheap so why not?"
2044,"I have tried this antenna with my FM radio.After moving it to different locations in the room, turning,etc. I gave up and got a simple dipole antenna, which works much better than this one.KISS method worked better for me..."
2045,This kit comes with everything you need to start repairing computers. The only down side is the kit comes with a cheap flashlight and soldering iron (with no led).
2046,"This router is fine for simple network Peer to peer, hooking up multiple computers to the internet for web browsing. However, the routers software has serious flaws on it's port forwarding/virtual server configuration. Basically, it won't allow you to enter in your settings. This means you can't run a web server, ftp server, etc with through this. Tech support is non-existant. I've tried the lastest and older firmware, they all have the same problem."
2047,"First, let me add my voice to those who received broken speakers.  Not only did one speaker have the (now famous) broken tweeter which was rattling around in the box, but the other speaker had a blown tweeter!This is unacceptable.  It's called a manufacturer defect and they really need to address the problem by pulling all of the inventory and inspecting it.I had hoped to get a speaker with great sound but in the end, it was just a waste of my time."
2048,"It gave me the extra length I needed and it has several sizes of adapters which, while I haven't used them, will probably come in handy in the future."
2049,"Iomega is a name I trust. I've had Zip drives since before there was dirt and have never had a minute's grief with any of them. Nevertheless I did debate about buying this item because I wasn't sure I needed it. Still, I'm a gadget geek, so I went ahead and ordered it. And what I found was that I probably didn't really need it, but I do kind of like it.I love the idea of swappable media. Unfortunately, the disks only hold about 40 minutes worth of music, which is okay, they're tiny. I can carry several days' worth of tunes in my pockets. I really wanted it for Audible content (audio books for those of you who aren't familiar with audible.com) and herein lies the biggest drawback of all: HipZip firmware only supports Audible formats 2 and 3. These are less compressed than format 1 and thus bigger. This is a problem for me for two reasons. First, if I want to buy anything that weighs in at over 40 megs (slightly less; each disk has some operating fribble on it) I can't write it to a disk. This would be any unabridged novel, and quite a few abridged ones.Second, and perhaps more annoying, Audible doesn't make all its content available in all formats. The bulk of what I've already downloaded is only available as format 1 files, which means I only listen to the content on my computer. I don't want to turn this into a rant against Audible or Iomega, but it seems to me that neither position is easily defensible, and the loser is anyone who thinks that the HipZip is going to allow them to go portable with the greater part of Audible's content.That said, I have to say that this is one of the best audio players I've ever used. The swapable media puts it way out ahead to begin with, but it's also easier to use than either my Rave or my Rio. It comes with a rechargeable battery (the conservationist in me loves this, the audio fanatic is annoyed at having to stop and recharge for 2 hours when it runs out) and light, secure headphones. The screen could be easier to read - it's a bit dark - but it's not bad. The package comes with two rewriteable disks, which gives you 80 megs of storage, and additional disks aren't horribly expensive. And the sound? Very good.All things considered, I'd say that if you like the idea of small, lightweight swappable media over expensive RAM upgrades, this is a great unit."
2050,"The sound from these headphones is top of the line, its a pleasure to listen to my music with these phones. They are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time.  Dislikes;  I don't like having to adjust them each time I put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts. The cable is a little short for me but works. I would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connector."
2051,"This antenna didn't work well for me, but that doesn't mean it won't work well for you. My advice is to try out several antennas and see which one works the best for your situation. Don't even bother reading reviews because what works for one person might not work well for another."
2052,"i got this to replace ad-link gigabit switchswitch. it worked for a few months, then the other day, something went wrong & it stopped transferring packets & just flashed its link lights. resetting it didn't help. i pulled it from the network & replaced it with an older linksys switch i've kept around. discovered both myimac& mylacie 2big network raidwere still unable to connect. resetting their respective ethernet settings finally restored my network but gave me quite a fright. thelacie 2big network raidis still not right - see my review of that gadget.i'd previously had a higher opinion of netgear. now i think i'll stick to linksys ..."
2053,This printer worked great for 6 months ink was fine nice photo quality on prints.Now everytime I try to print the paper jams.  I made sure the rollers are fine and unplugged/reset printer.  Even tried different paper.  Nothing works this printer is not worth purchasing for 6 months of use.
2054,"For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones."
2055,"I bought my first pair of MDR-V6 headphones back in 1990.  The V6s were awesome then, and are still awesome today.  Sony came out with the MDR-V600 'phones later, and when I wore out my original MDR-V6 'phones, I tried those out.  What a waste of money.  The MDR-V6 units are much clearer, have lots punchier bass, and just sound ""in your face"".  The V-600s sound muffled and weak in comparison.  I'm glad Sony listened to their customers and re-issued the V6s after they were discontinued.  They also sell the identical headphones under a ""professional"" model number MDR-7506.  You'll pay about $30 more for the 7506s, and they do have a longer warranty (3 years as opposed to 1) and fancy gold-colored jacks, but my original V6s lasted about 10 years before needing to be replaced, and who cares what color the jacks are?  I highly recommend these 'phones to anyone who needs accurate, tight, clear sounding 'phones.  If you want the longer warranty and silly gold colored jacks, buy the costlier MDR-7506 ""professional"" ones.  Either way, you'll enjoy awesome sound.Pros:Clear highs, punchy bassHigh sensitivity - 106 dB at 1mWComes with a soft drawstring carrying caseComes with a 1/8"" to 1/4"" screw-on TRS plug adapterCons:Can be a little uncomfortable over extended periods of use (over an hour for me), but you can find replacement pads for the earpads that afford a little more comfort. Search Amazon for ""sony 211566803"".  Should be around $12 or so."
2056,"After using these, they are fine but I ordered the Memorex Jewel Cases as pictured and that is not what I received.  I received 50 cases in a brown box with no manufacturer.  Be wary of FantasyBuy."
2057,This filter fit easily on my camera and adjusts very easily also.  I like its small size and the compactness of its storage case.
2058,Well I pretty much bought this mic because it is cheap.. and i wanted to video chat.  Well I can understand why it is cheap cause it barely works.  The only way to let the other person hear me is to hold it up to my mouth at least an inch away even then I have to speak louder than usual.  But if you are looking for a cheap mic and u dont mind doing that then be my guest.
2059,"This anti-static wrist band makes a nice constant ground contact between my skin and my computer frame. There is also plenty of stretch out of the spiral chord. Finally, the aligator clip is plenty strong to hold on tight to the laptop board frame."
2060,I bought this cable to tranfer video files from my JVC camcorder to my laptop through 1349 link. It works nice but I think if it had noise filters the quality may be better. Anyway I'm quite satisfied with this cable in quality and value.
2061,No complaints. Does what I need it for. For the price you can't beat it.
2062,"I have used Memorex in the past with no problems.  I bought a couple 50 packs spindles and burned abour 20 of them with no problem.  Then the next one failed at he beginning of recording, and the next and the next and the next.  In all, I have had about 15 failures in a row on both my laptop and desktop computers.  At first, I thought my burner went bad, but I tried some Fuji disks that I had (recording the same thing) and they worked every time.  I can not record any music or data files on these Memorex disks.  Even if Memorex would replace them, I want something I can trust."
2063,"This unit is difficult to program, and the buttons are hard to press. What may be the worst though is that battery life is very poor in the ""alert"" mode. The Midland units that run on AC power (with battery backup) are somewhat better, but still difficult to use."
2064,"This cable is worthless. When I first got it, I put it in my laptop's combined 3.5mm analog/optical output jack, and it seemed to work great. Unfortunately, however, when I removed the cable, the plastic sheathing broke and remained inside of the jack. The product is covered by a lifetime warranty, however, considering that this failed less than an hour after recieving it, I will simply buy a better quality cable. Buyer beware."
2065,"Porta Pros can be broken easily but mostly is snapped back ,Audio Technica Under $ 1oo great too for under $"
2066,"This is a very low quality cable. When used with a set top box, the picture often stutters.When I used it with a cable modem, my signal to noise ratio was awful on somee channels and my modem rebooted.Swapped cables to rg6 and all my signals went perfect, and the tv stopped stuttering.I mean, this cable only says for use with lcd, so I am sure it's fine for low bandwidth like sdtv, but it's a very thin cable.Avoid this"
2067,"Hello folks,I guess most of the good reviews  are written with in a month of purchase.This battery was okay (Not good) for few initial charges . Now when I put it for charging, the charge complte light will come on in 5 minutes. Then i could take few pics. My original canon battery (5 yrs)hold more charge than this one. I could not locate the warranty form in the original packagng. Tried their website and the only thing I found was a pdf to send the produt back to them (No RMA etc).I do not under stand how they rate the battery to 1500mah(may be just sticker).Bottom line : IMO do not BUY this product."
2068,"This is poorly crafted. Too bad Bushnell puts their GOOD name on junk like this. Also, it would seem to me that if a bino were tripod adaptable you would not need an adapter if the screw hole is positioned properly you would simply screw the bino straight to the tripod. Also Amazon should make their description match the manufacturer so both Amazon and the customers would see that  this adapter is not compatible with the Legacy 12-22 X 50 mm bino."
2069,"I find that this little player has great sound quality and is fairly simple to use.  However, as soon as I installed the software, I had to update it.  I also had to update the firmware.  I bought this to send to my boyfriend in Iraq with the intention of continuing to send him new music during the time he is on active duty.  The MP3 player had to have no moving parts because of the sand storms. However, when I received the player, installed everything, and copied music to the Smart Card using a Smart Card Reader/Writer, the player would not recognize the songs, even though they would play on the computer.  It turns out that the software puts a hidden file on the Smart Card so that the player knows that the card was copied to when in the player.  This means that the music MUST be copied directly to the player itself, which would not be in the country. This is a severe issue for those who will not have direct access to the player when copying songs.  I highly recommend a different brand for those people."
2070,The PSC 100 case looks great plus it is very soft too. The pocket provides enough room for an extra memory card and battery. My only complaint is it adds a little too much bulk for your pocket. The case adds around 1/2 inch of thickness to the camera which is a lot considering the small footprint of the Elph. I can put up with the bulk for the added protection the case provides.
2071,"One end appeared to be functional, but the other was so askew that it was impossible to insert a miniplug.  Closer inspection reveals that the inside plastic is split and forcing the inner contacts astray.This coupler also arrived with the two ends mismatched.  Neither were gold-colored as the illustration indicates.  Some poor chump in a third-world sweatshop is probably just grabbing random parts out of a bin and soldering them together.They also claim to be ""ROHS (sic) Compliant"" and have a ""lifetime warranty"".  Since it literally arrived in a plastic bag, it's not clear how warranty claims can be made, so it's just another misleading lie to land the sale.  As for RoHS compliance, it will be pretty easy to disprove that claim with a lead test swab.All-in-all, a pathetic product from a dishonest company which I can only assume is actually named ""Cables To Go"".  It's pretty hard to screw up such a simple item, and yet they managed to do so."
2072,"I bought these cans after reading loads of review. I am not disappointed--these are the best headphones I've ever owned. They are great for everything from opera to electronic music. You'll hear every detail in the recording, including the noise that maybe there. The sound is present, flat (as in honest) and lively."
2073,"this thing eventually fell apart and after pretty minimal use...filters should simply not fall apart or should have a lifetime warranty, will never buy from this company again.UPDATE: Called customer support and they are either going to fix or send me a new one at no additional charge.  Spoke directly to a customer service rep, he took the initiative for this course of action...great customer service, back on the Tiffen train."
2074,"I bought one of these hubs in Dec 2006, and it has worked flawlessly since then. Recently I bought a 2nd hub for another location. It looks and performs identically to the older hub. I use it with a USB-powered external hard drive, an iPhone 4, digital camera, keyboard, and mouse. The older hub is connected to a PC, the newer one to a Mac Mini. Both the iPhone and external hard drive draw significant amounts of power, but the external transformer supplies plenty of juice.The product description says the hub will work when self-powered, but I always use it with the external transformer.My only complaint is that the external transformer is kind of large, so it may cover adjacent plugs when plugged into a power strip.Update May 31 2011: I just upgraded my Mac Mini to an iMac, and the hub has problems with it. After the iMac comes out of standby, devices connected to the hub are disconnected or hung. You can see in Apple's discussion forums that this is a common problem with the D-Link hub on iMac and Macbook. So if you are looking for a USB hub for a Mac, stick to the brands sold in Apple's store."
2075,"I spend at least 10 hours a week in these mixing music professionally.  I've owned mine since the late 80s and have two pair: one for home and one for work.  I've replaced the earpads about every 8 years.These are quite simply one of the best ten products I've ever owned.  The sound quality is unparalleled.  They are efficient enough to be driven loud from a computer or an ipod.  I have a super large head and these are very comfortable.  Those of you complaining they are too tight don't understand how to adjust them - pull the earpieces down if they are too tight.I've never found a better pair at any price.  The fact that these are under $100, last essentially forever, and sound superb, is a modern miracle.Flat frequency response as high as any human ear can hear and lower than most any equipment can produce, and yet the sound is pleasing from just about any source.Buy a pair of them without hesitation.  You'll never regret it."
2076,"I was looking for an adapter that split the stereo signal into two separate monaural signals. I've since learned that the description for what I want usually refers to ""tip and ring"" outputs"" - those types of splitters are hard to find.The description led me to believe it was what I wanted, but I should have read it more carefully. As a stereo splitter for attaching two headphones I suppose it would be fine."
2077,"Unfortunately, I had to return the DP-300U product since I couldn't interface to my primary printer. I didn't know all printers wouldn't work. After talking with D-Link support, D-Link has a webpage indicating which printers are compatible with this print server, so I recommend you visit their website before buying this product for compatibility reasons.I needed a print server for my multiple computers and printers, but the compatibility issue nixed this one. My HP color printer using the USB port worked great, but my Canon laser printer using the parallel port didn't work. Some Canon printers work, but not mine. I'll keep searching for another print server.It has some nice features, but Amazon took it back and that's what's nice about dealing with Amazon."
2078,"This mouse is good, not nearly perfect though. If you are on a budget, grab this mouse, you won't be sorry. If you have the money though, go get the IntelliMouse Explorer Wireless, it is much more comfortable than this mouse, it also has the extra buttons on the side. Overall a good mouse. Much better than anything Logitech can throw at it."
2079,"I ordered two an one was bad. However at this price, I guess that's to be expected. It's still better than paying 5x as much at a brick and mortar."
2080,"And as an audiophile and audio enthusiast, i've owned MANY over the years, both cheap and expensive.  In short, these headphones have a very 'veiled' and subdued sound, which noticeably holds back much of the music.  Even for the low money, you can find much better sounding 'cans' in the ten dollar range.  I have a cheap set of Sony's that cost me around ten bucks that 'blow away' these Maxell's in every respect... better and tighter bass, and more airy and detailed mids and highs.  This probably why I found these on sale for four bucks at 'Big Lots'!"
2081,I plugged it in and the Ethernet signal passed through it.  I don't know what else you could ask from a cable.
2082,"Bought for my Nephew as I have a pair that was purchased in 1989 and after replacing the pads are still wonderful.He really likes them and I rarely see him without them now! (He's 15)He's using them with his iPhone, iPad, and notebook.Hopefully he'll get 35+ years out of them."
2083,"After reading so many positive reviews for the Expert Mouse before I bought it, it I'm a bit hesitant to write my own because it's the total opposite from most of the praise you'll read here.I really tried to like this thing. But I can't - here's why:As a professional video and photo editor I've known about these types of devices for a long time and it always sounded a good idea to use one in principle. Sadly, I'm one of those who just cannot work properly with it.First off, if you do anything that requires very small and precise movements, forget about it. I don't know how so many folks can work with the Expert Mouse. I have large hands but even for me the trackball is simply way too large. No matter how subtly I move my fingers, the trackball jerks the pointer all over my 24 inch screens.Now - and think about it - when you have your hand over the trackball, and you try to move your fingers to touch one of the buttons, you're bound to move the cursor again without wanting to.Trying to make precise cuts on a video timeline has so far been incredibly frustrating. You can adjust the sensitivity but even that didn't solve this problem for me.If you click a lot and do it fast, forget about it too. You'll have to have your fingers in such an awkward position over that gigantic trackball that clicking a button requires even weirder movements with your fingers. Again, in principle you'd think the layout and size would be awesome but it's just not.Finally - that clicking noise. OMG! Are you kidding me? This is by far the loudest, most annoying clicking noise of any input device I have ever had - and I've had 30 or more over the years. I'm used to a quiet work environment and the noise coming from the buttons is absolutely not acceptable.Yes, the build quality and all that stuff is fine. It does work on Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. But considering how terrible it is to use I'm really quite baffled of why this thing is so popular; maybe I'm a uncoordinated clutz. Whatever the case - after about an hour of trying to fight through a simple edit I disconnected it and went back to my trusty old two-button mouse. Ahhhh yes, much MUCH faster again.Hope this helps."
2084,"I bought the Envision because of the price and what you get as far as specs.The first one I brought home would not power on.  So I took it back and got a different one.The quality of the product is not that great.  The plastic casing of the flat panel is just cheap.  The cover on the back where you tuck in the cables has really small tabs that break off very easily, so be careful.I wish I would have spent a little extra and bought a Sony or Viewsonic"
2085,"One thing I've learned from the reviews here is that it would be easier to weight comments if you knew more about the reviewer.  I am still a relative newbie, and have progressed from an old Pentax film SLR, through the basic point and shoot digitals, to a more advanced point and shoot, and about 18 months ago I bought a used Rebel XT from a friend.  I thought the kit lens was a huge step up from the p-s cameras, and was amazed by the image quality of this lens.  Most of my comparisons are to the Canon 28-135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM lens, which was the other lens I was considering when I made this purchase.  I have had the chance to use both, and am still happy with the choice I made.The lens makes beautiful photos throughout its zoom range, although it likes natural light better than artificial.  It is the best first upgrade I can imagine for anyone who isn't a professional, but then... you aren't really considering this lens if you are.  If you do more of your shooting indoors, consider spending the extra $$ for the 28-135 IS USM, which handles low light better.  Outdoors I find that this lens works better than the 28-135, producing sharper images especially when you are able to shoot at f7.1 or higher.  Images are sharp, colors are true and beautiful, and this lens is capable of some stunning bokeh effects if you take the time to experiment with it.  I am able to get sharp images all the way to f4.5 at 105mm, unlike some of the other reviewers here... maybe differences in copies of the lens?  I'm not sure why, it just works.Having said all that, lately I have had the opportunity to spend time shooting with different lenses, borrowing from a friend who is something of a semi-pro, and I am starting to see the weaknesses of this lens.  As I mentioned before, it tends to focus slowly in low light situations, and images tend to be underexposed in tungsten light.  It can be compensated for once you know about it, but the 28-135 IS is easier to use indoors.  If you don't mind using flash it's no big deal, but it's worth mentioning.  It's also a little short for my liking lately. I'm finding I prefer to sit outside the action where my presence won't influence the shot, and 105mm is sometimes a little short for that.  That's more an issue of suitability rather than a weakness in this lens though.In summary, this is the lens to get for the first upgrade from the kit lens.  It works great as an every day lens, giving up only a little at the wide end compared to the kit lens, but capable of far sharper, brighter images everywhere.  For the money you can't beat it.  Would I replace it if lost or broken?  You bet."
2086,"My first review was not accepted, not sure why...?These connectors/adapters work fine but they only sent ONE in my package, when it lists two.This was fixed fast thanks to the service dept. and all is well now.HOSA makes terrific stuff and they work fine, this is more geared toward the 'service' of getting them."
2087,When I bought the camera I found the screen to be too small and it was really grainy at even it's lowest iso.
2088,"This converter does not work to connect a Logitech USB wireless mouse on a PS/2 KVM switch.  Someone said it did work, but it doesn't. I wish I wouldn't have wasted money on this."
2089,I'm thinking this was purchased somewhere else. It was Amazon's reviews that helped make a decision to buy. Reading through these reviews it looked like heat and/or a poor power supply would result in switch failure. Placing 1 fan below and 1 fan beside kept things cool. A similar but .5 Amp higher power supply was found. My switch failed last night. All 14 computers lost net. Looking it up would tell me exactly when but it has been about 6 months. Yes turning it off and back on will persuade it to function again. Most people would agree that jumping up from what your using internet for to reboot a switch is not acceptable. Netgear's ProSafe gigabit switches with 5 or 8 ports have worked wonderfully. This one has a problem.
2090,"This product from Amazon itself is NOT the Cobra HA-TA antenna, but rather an unlabeled counterfeit of the stock Cobra handheld non-telescopic rubber duck antenna.  Upon establishing this, I did not remove it from the package as it will be returned.  Build quality appears to be adequate given that&#8212;possibly even made by Cobra's supplier.  I cannot be certain that the product is tuned for 27 MHz and will not be testing it.  It could be absolutely any antenna in there.  Use it at your own risk.  Handheld radios out of necessity have to tolerate a bit more SWR variance than the average CB, but if the antenna is completely out of resonance it could cook your CB.Regardless, the primary reason to buy the Cobra HT-TA is to obtain an antenna that exchanges the convenience, size, and relative strength of a rubber duck for the signal strength of a longer antenna.  What Amazon is presently selling isn't what you're getting.  Perhaps one of the alternative sellers has the real thing, but as of the end of November 2013, Amazon.com itself does not."
2091,"Fits snugly into receptacle.  However, when plugging my cable into the right angle adapter itself, there was no positive action  - seems like friction alone keeps the cable plugged in and it wouldn't take much for accidental disconnect.  Might tape up the connection for security."
2092,"Functional, but not my favorite snagless design.  The rubber half-boots over the cable ends interfeer with the removel of this cable.  This is not a problem if you're not taking the cable in and out like I do, or if you never have the cable in a tight connection like I do.  There are better designs, like the ones with an additional piece of plastic covering the connection from the opposite direction."
2093,"Think twice before you buy these non-slip headphones. I was very disappointed with the fit of these headphones.  They are design for specific type of ears and if you don't have those ears, forget it!  How do you know if you have the right size ears?  You just don't know until you try them on and realize they don't fit.  They are truly uncomfortable and not very flexible.  Save your money and find something else.  Don't buy them because of the low price.  There is a reason for the low price. Who wants them!"
2094,"After 48hrs no charging, cells all cold. Printed out return and receivedrefund in about 10 days. Since then, I've learned that you want a LOWdischarge rate for digital cameras. Get a 2100 mAh or thereabouts."
2095,"Just hear buzzing through this thing.  Can hear sounds too, but a constant buzzing makes it almost impossible to use."
2096,"These Memorex CD\DVD Sleeves work as expected to hold CD\DVD media but as others have noted, the rubber band used to package the sleeves significantly wrinkled the clear plastic window that shows the image printed on the disc. Ordinarily this would not be a problem for most uses, but we professionally produce instructional and promotional videos that we bulk distribute in similar sleeves. Unfortunately we ran out at the end of a production run so needed a few extra to finish the job so I ended up buying two packs of these locally and went through them to find fifty that were not too badly distorted to use for our customer, the rest we will use for our own discs in our shop.Otherwise these are decent enough quality for daily use.CFH"
2097,"As instructions stated, I installed the latest firmware for the router (which obviously is on their site) and followed instructions.  NO BIG DEAL. IT WORKS!But if you are the type who think they know everything and don't take time to read instructions OR if you are not comfortable with computers, go with another brand because updating the latest firmware may not be for you.Signal strength fluctuates around 65% to 50% at 50 feet (my bedroom to the living room).  Can't really notice a drop off in performance but maybe if I had a larger apartment :pIts an all around good cable router which allows me to check my email and surf the web without having to buy 100ft of Cat 5 cable."
2098,"I travel extensively internationally (around 30 weeks a year) so I was looking for a universal adapter that I could stick in my bag instead of having to remember to bring the right adapter for each business trip.I tried this adapter out and found it was lacking.Pros:1. It does work in most outlets worldwide. The one exception is some UK safety sockets...more later2. It is not too terribly large3. The trendy white color :-)Cons:1. It will stop working frequently when using the europlug. In order to make electrical contact the europlug must be flipped all the way up. Unfortunately it is on a hinge with very little resistance so any weight on it (like a cable plugged into it) causes the plug adapter itself to rotate on this hinge causing the plug to lose contact. You only have to wake up to a dead cell phone once before figuring this out.2. It does not work in UK safety sockets. Some of the safety sockets in the UK require the grounding pin to hit a switch that allows the rest of the plug to go in. For some reason this plug does not always work in those.3. It is bigger than it looks in the picture.In summary, buy the Kensington model instead. I have 2 and they work great.Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter"
2099,"On a whim, I bought aEasycat 2BUTTON PS/2 Touchpad Blk Cirque Glidepoint Technology, albeit a used model. My laptop is pretty new, so there are no PS/2 ports. I bought this adapter (by the same company that makes the touch pad) to plug into my USB port. The touch pad worked in some basic functions (although the vertical and horizontal scrolling never worked). I downloaded and installed Adesso's GlidePoint drivers so that I could perform the fancy gesture motions.That was a bust.A message appeared saying that a valid device could not be detected. I contacted Adesso customer service (very fast response to their credit) and the rep told me that GlidePoint would not work if ANY type of adapter was used (in other words - this one). To confirm this, I fired up my decade-old computer with a PS/2 port. Low and behold, GlidePoint installed and worked fine (except the gestures because this was a used model I purchased from another site.So in short, this may work for you in other capacities, but if you are in the small minority of people that use one of their touch pads and wish to 'enhance' it with GlidePoint, make sure you get either the USB or PS/2 type that connect the touch pad directly to your computer so as to bypass this adapter altogether.I can't be too mad because it was an impulse buy done without prior research on my part, but in my mind if a company makes both the device and the adapter, it should know about and correct usage errors between the two. But that's just my opinion.Take care!"
2100,Sound was good but too hot on the ears for exercising in the gym.  I switched to the in ear headphones.
2101,Amazing sound at an amazing price.  They are more bass heavy than the KSC75. Together they compliment each other very well!
2102,"PROS: Love the folding ability, good enough sound, sweat does not seem affect it. Cheap.CONS: Short lifetime after heavy abuse, even though they are advertised as exercise headphones.FINAL VERDICT: Worth it if you don't mind buying new ones every once in a while.SUMMARY: I have bought these and worked out to them for years. The folding mechanism makes them be able to take more punishment while they are in my gym bag. But the amount of abuse from running on the treadmill will eventually wear out the connections to the speakers, as invariably one of the speakers will start to cut out after heavy use. But they are so cheap I just keep buying new ones, maybe 4 pairs over as many years. I have yet to find a really good pair that can take a beating sound good, AND STAY ON MY HEAD WHILE RUNNING as well as these can. If you find one let me know."
2103,"At least to my ears.  The fit is horrible, and since the fit is horrible, they sound horrible, with absolutely no bass at all.  The pain is insane.  I can't wear these for more than half an hour.  These are as horrible as what comes bundled with most players.  Don't waste your 10 bucks.  Replaced them withSony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones."
2104,"Customer service is rather bad.  First of all, to get a pretty standard item for all wireless/portable product, a car adapter, you're going to have to shell out an extra $40 and this is for any of Creative's Nomads since they purposely made the input voltage a non-standard one of 5V.  Secondly if you ask questions to tech support, they pretty much just answer questions you didn't even ask and ignore the one you really want answered.  I had this issue both through e-mail and on the phone.  Finally, during a phone call, I said, &quot;So am I never going to know the answer to this question?&quot;  The tech guy ACTUALLY said something in regard to it making his call time average high, if he looks for the answer.  To get a replacement battery, expect to pay around $120.  $20 for diagnosis, $15 to ship it there and $85 for the battery itself.  All of this just a couple months after it's 90 day warranty."
2105,I used to connect my hard drive and camera and computer with this cable. It did it's job well and we eventually replaced HD with one of the new usb. I still owe it but rarely used in past 1 year
2106,"Trust the user reviews on here - the cords for these great earphones really do wear out after 2-3 months.  They literally disintegrate.  It's not worth buying these 4 times a year when you can get a better pair (Shure e3c?) for a little more.It's a real shame because the sound and comfort of these earphones (for the good price) can't be beaten.  I used them on airplanes, I used them at the gym, at work - most noise gets blocked out brilliantly.  The bass levels are strong, since the earbud goes into your air - if this is a problem, adjust the equalizer on your audio device.I was over the moon for the first 2 months with these.  I will NOT buy again though - I've been through 2 pairs and until Sony fix the flimsy wiring, you should avoid this set of earphones."
2107,"I did not get the headphones that are pictured with white, black and blue on sides. What I got is some ugly looking gray/black headphones but the problem was not that only. They sound ok for $5 but the design is very bad. The plastic going around your head is very hard plastic and way too big around the back of the head there is a big gap. The part sitting on top of your ear hurts a lot. You cannot wear them without feeling something pushing into your head. Not even $5 is worth this pain. I returned them."
2108,"I had been using a brand x power cord for the last two years and false laser alerts were becoming more and more common - to the point that I nearly couldn't use it. Read on line that it could be a poor connection with power source. Decided to try it. Shamalama ding dong, it solved the problem!"
2109,Setup was easy. Works without problems with my Powerbook and desktop PC with 64 bit WEP encryption enabled. However the router sometimes freezes and keeps rebooting itself. I loose connection and have to power down the router and then power it up to make it stable.Also performance is not good. If I connect my 3Mbps Comcast Motorola SurfBoard cable modem directly to my PC I get about 2.2-2.8 Mbps from Speakeasy test. Once I connect it thru the router (wired 100Mbps LAN connection ) I get down to mostly 1.8-2.2 Mbps and sometimes upto 2.5Mbps max. The wireless conection with my Powerbooks 802.11b is worse as i can get about 1.5-1.9 mbps !Significant drop in bandwidth I will think.Avoid this cheap router and go with Linksys instead.
2110,"The SanDisk card reader is a good product for any Mac user with a USB connection.  At first, I had experience some problems with the reader (I had deleted images from the card, but it was not freeing up memory), but after I downloaded and installed the latest drivers from SanDisk, all my problems went away.  The ease of use of this product was quite simply astounding.  When you place a card in the reader, it will appear on your desktop (assuming you use a Mac) as any floppy disc or CD would.  From there, you can copy the files to your hard drive by just dragging and dropping them into any folder on your computer.  When you've done that, just drag the files from the card to the trash and empty it. Voila!  You have just cleared the space off the card!  It really is simplicity in motion.  I highly recommend this easy to use product."
2111,"The Koss SportaPro Headphones are terrific.  They are Lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described.  These phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes.  The cord is 4 feet long. Sound quality is fabulous.  When you consider the low price, these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin.  You cannot go wrong with this one.  Highly recommended."
2112,I have other high tend phones but I like Koss so I thought the price was right and bought them. I have to say these are way better than one would think. They live up to the Koss name all I can say. Oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong. The bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum. The only thing I don't like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my taste.
2113,perhaps it is my mistake but this item is labeled as a Minijack cable and says 2.5mm on the description...it just arrived and its just like any other 3.5mm cable... the quality if good but it is not the right cable i desired.cable is wide and has good terminals but again not what i wanted
2114,"In consumer audio, almost everything has standardized on the 3.5mm plug (headphones, inputs and outputs).  So when it needed at 2.5mm cable, I made the mistake of assuming Mini-Jack mean the smaller of the two. (The size of the connector was deep in the description and I missed it.)  It's still a good cable, which I will use in future projects.  It just wished they would make the actual size clearer in the description."
2115,"I was looking forward to a great pair of earphones that I could take to the gym...and while they're great on the subway, these STINK on the treadmill.  A little bit of sweat is all you need for them to pop out of your ears, and once that happens, you're out of luck."
2116,The RCA adaptor is OK but a little complicated to put together to use.  I had expected to just plug the adaptor into the device and then into the outlet and it does not work that way!
2117,"Folks, these are great sounding speakers. They truly are. But these speakers are ALL digital and play TRUE digital sound. Even though they may sound great, these speakers only play 2.1 sound unless you have a DIRECT digital connection. Not even your Audigy 2 can play with all five channels going on here. Even if they are plugged into the D-IN on your Audigy 2, they will only play 2.1 sound, and no more. If you have an nForce motherboard such as the ASUS deluxe edition, then these speakers are great because on that specific motherboard you can play true-to-life digital sound, including direct Dolby Digital. The decoding on the Audigy 2 soundcard is way different. These speakers are meant generally for consoles and can only be used to the fullest on computers containing an ASUS Deluxe nForce2 motherboard. To those users out there: You are VERY lucky people. For the rest of us with KT400s or etc., you should go and buy an all-analog system or a digital speaker system made specifically for the Audigy 2 if you want digital. These are not the option."
2118,"Fairly easy to hook up to speaker wires.  Allows one amp to drive up to 4 sets of stereo speakers without blowing the amp.  Provides very good sound quality to all speakers. However from the ""can't get something for nothing"" department, there is a marked volume drop across all speakers as each pair is brought on-line.  Further it would be nice if there were separate volume controls for each pair.  My set up includes two sets of outdoor hidden ""rock"" speakers around our pool, a set of outdoor speakers near our BBQ and a set inside our living room.  All are driven adequately with my Yamaha 35watt amp cranked up to max.  It would be nice to be able to turn down the living room whilst keeping the BBQ cranked!  Anyway, fine quality product, good price, just may not do everything."
2119,Good product for the money.  The only complaint i have is that it would be nice to have an elastic arm band.
2120,"Dont buy it if you dont need to...Use a HDMI cable instead.Its up to you, but I made a mistake buying it, I have no use for it."
2121,"When I purchased my digital camera (Kodak DC280) I included one of these for extra space.  The card works properly and was at a good price.  What else can you ask for?Not much, unless you find that you sometimes take lots of photos.  I guess that includes me.  In which case you'll wish that you purchased a larger card.  I bought the Viking 128mb card, and now feel completely prepared with the combined cards providing enourmous storage.  Unless you are going to be away for an extended period, I can't imagine needing more space.The bottom line is that this card works, but you need to really consider what your storage requirements will be so you can select the right size."
2122,"had three, all broke. not good quality, sound okay but not the quality of the product. I do like the adapter that comes with it, that is good."
2123,"All of the tools except the IC-chip grabber is very useful for building a computer or maintaining/ repairing them.The nut drivers did not fit my case nuts, so it didn't do me any good.If Belkin has an anti-static wrist band with this kit, I would put a five-star on this product."
2124,"This is a great inexpensive usb cable.  I got it for my printer which is up on a shelf about 10' away from my desk.I ordered the 16' so i would have some more length to play with to travel around the floor and not have the cable be tight across the wall.  The downside to this length is well it is long, and so when i pulled it out i did not believe it was that long with how tight they had rolled it up,  I hooked it up and it was like a phone cord all coiled up, so i took it to my deck and hung it in the sun for the afternoon and it relaxed quickly and seemed like a million feet long.The cable is nice and flexible now, i was hoping from belkin it would have a little more heft and thickness to the cable it self.  It is not ultra thin but i would not pull on it to hard for fear of kinking it and damaging the copper leads.  The ends are firmly attached and molded in to the  cable as you would expect, and the plugs are within perimeters and fit well in all usb ports.Overall i would suggest this to anyone who needed a long cable, but if i cold find for a simular price one of those nice clear ones with the heavy braided jackets i would jump on that one instead."
2125,"They (had two replacements) all got fried in thunderstorms. I haven't had any problem with cheaper poe devices, so I will claim this isn't very robust."
2126,"At the time of writing this, I can only seem to find this coiled 3.5mm extension cord...and that's not a bad thing. This comes with 4 adapters, and they all work well. I've been testing this cable with Sennheiser HD515s and I don't have any issues. The only complaint, or minor annoyance, I have is that although it is 20 feet long, the majority of it coiled tightly. So, while you may not reasonably be able to stretch it the entire 20 feet, it is certainly manageable. I use this in conjunction withCables To Go - 03182 - 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cableconnected to my TV, and it's great not wake others up when I play Gears of War."
2127,"I bought these so I could listen to my TV at night without waking my roommate. I found that they were functional, in that I could hear what was playing, however there was a constant noise of static with everything I watched. If I wanted more volume, the volume of the static would also increase.Don't buy this if you're looking for audio quality. Buy them if you want cheap, functional wireless headphones with a bit of static.Pros: Price, ...They're Wireless, decent charge from the battery.Cons: Awful static"
2128,"I have been a long standing customer of 3M, especially for adhesive products, but let me tell you the mounting adhesives are worthless.  I have a glossy smooth finish I mounted the privacy filter to, and when closing the laptop the adhesive mounts would come unglued.  Granted I use the product on a laptop, which may get a little warm, and closing the lid probably loosened them (but regular tape adhesive mentioned below works excellent?)I got fed up with having to restick the mounts everytime and then try to slide the privacy screen under the mount's edges on both sides  simultaneously to secure it.  This is when my BIG disappointment came.  The privacy filter is apparently a stiff plastic with a second plastic coating (makes sense), except the seam split on the corner edge and peeled apart and now you can not legibly use the product (one corner is cloudy now).I finally got angry and used regular clear tape to adhere the filter to the screen!  It works a lot better.  Just wish I would have been smart about it, before the engineering mistake cost me $45."
2129,It's a cable & it works. Nicely molded connector and secure latch clip. Well made and a good value. What else to say?
2130,"The intended reason for the purchase did not work out however,  was cheap enough that I didn't have to return and found uses for it."
2131,"There's a lot to like about this device, but it falls way short on one of its most advertised features, WiFi, and PalmOne is pretty poor on tech and warranty support.  In short:Pros-- Nice design & features (when they work!)-- Fast processor/fast performance-- Integrated keyboard has great tactile feel and response-- Well built, sturdy feelCons--  WiFi is very unreliable (I'm only infrequently successful in getting it to connect to my home wireless network, and I've tried every fix in the book)--  Screen is unevenly backlit, so it appears blotchy, especially at the bottom (my T2 had a much better screen)--  PalmOne product support is all but non-existent.--  If you have a problem with a Palm, even within days of purchasing it, expect Palm to handle the problem by sending you a ""refurb"", in other words a used machine that may cosmetically fall anywhere between new and beat-up."
2132,"The CLA-4 Lens Adapter Tube seems very difficult to position so it will thread straight into the lens barrel. I lose a lot of time getting it positioned just exactly right. Other than that, it is fine - it fits the camera and the telephoto lens and seems to hold the rather heavy lens quite securely once it is properly positioned."
2133,This display isn't compatible with current Powerbooks.  An expensive adapter is required.Same adapter is required for any industry standard DVI port.
2134,"Added 9/28/07: I later found that the cigarette lighter socket on my car could not supply much power, so it was not the fault of the Linksys inverter that it did not perform well in my car.Original review: This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that.Corrected conclusion, 10/6/2011: The fact that this inverter couldn't power my laptop was probably due to a fault in my car's wiring to the lighter plug, and not the fault of the inverter.  I amended the review in 2007, and with this further amendment I have changed the star rating to 4 out of 5.  Maybe I should have given it 5 stars, because I didn't really give it a fair test before returning it for a refund. The useful conclusion in this review is that if an inverter doesn't seem to carry the load it is rated for, maybe you should check to see if you are getting a full 12V in to the inverter when under load."
2135,"Why buy more expensive headphones unless you're into some kind of job that requires better.  This head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many, many years of musical pleasure.  Some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new, what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problem."
2136,"These cameras start out life ok- good, actually- But then the dark side comes out, and that is the horrible lens drive system. The gears go bad, and repair is only temporary, even by Kodak. I repair these products for a major service company, and the design is just plain bad. Don't think you can get a cheap one on ebay, either, to fix yours- They all have the same problems. Toss it and buy something else."
2137,"Worked great for about one year. Then the flashing green lights of death that others have documented started. Just thought I'd add my vote to avoid this product. UPDATE TO REVIEW: I originally bought these in March of 2007, the first one died in September 08, the second one died December of 2008. The second failure wasn't as obvious and sat off in an office. The failure mode brought our entire network to a crawl until we found the culprit and unplugged it. I noticed on Netgear's web site that Prosafe products purchased after MAY of 2007, have  a lifetime warranty. Leads me to believe they must know they built and sold most of the JUNK prior to May and don't want to correct their problem for those of us who bought back then. That tells me all I need to know about Netgear. It's on to DLink."
2138,"I had a Fellowees privacy filter on my old laptop but had to change to 3M when i bought the new 15.6 Inch laptop, The problem with the product is the way it is attached to the screen, ,my laptop has a flat screen and this attaching the holding parts of the product to the screen proved to be a real mess. Once i was able to hold it together on the screen, the privacy filter works excellently.Update:After using this product for a week or two, the plastic parts attached to the screen starting falling off and it is causing me a nightmare to keep using this product. If you have a flat LCD like those on the new HPs then this product is going to be problematic for you, other than if your screen has a frame then by all means go ahead and buy the product."
2139,I purchased this to replace the much too short cord on the new telephone.  It is purported to be 12 ft long; only if two able bodied people can apply enough tension to stretch it to its full length.  All other aspects are satisfactory.  The price was low and shipping relatively fast for US snail mail.
2140,"I use this lens all the time, and never get bored of finding things to photograph with it. It is really a good lens and you will often see people comment on the fact that it may be one of those special lens' that could be L glass but gets away with being reasonably priced.Build: This is a solid well built lens. Its mostly metal construction ensures that it will last a long time. The focus ring is of course rubber and is easy to use. However this lens is heavy, so much so that if you are handholding it and using manual focus your camera holding hand will get tired. I have attempted to do this with a 430EX flash mounted on top and it is literally hand cramping after a while. You will most likely want to purchase a tripod collar with this lens, as a lot of focus will be lost due to camera shake.AF: This lens isn't the fastest lens on earth, and in conjunction with an XTi I find that it is sometimes annoyingly slow. It also tends to hunt a little in all but the best light conditions. Another reason to get a lens collar and use a tripod. However I rarely use autofocus with macro work, and prefer the control of manual. Given the shallow depths of field, manual is much more useful. Also the only time you really need a fast AF with macro is outside shooting bugs and such, and you will probably have the light of the sun which would of course be plenty to ensure the AF functions as you want it to. I wouldnt pass this lens up on account of the slightly slow AF.Picture Quality: I find that this lens produces incredibly sharp pictures (again, do not expect really sharp pictures hand held, I feel like a lot of people complain about this, but dont realize its their fault, not the lens'). The saturation and general color is amazing, and I rarely find that I have to up the saturation or vibrance. Personally I have found this lens to be tack sharp at f/4, and it stays there most of the time, as f/2.8 is a very very shallow depth of field.In Comparison: Although I do not own the 60mm macro, I have had a chance to use one, and although the 60mm is more versatile (i.e portraits), I would not give up the reach. Even at 100mm I find myself wishing I had the 180mm L lens. But 100mm is certainly better than 60mm. This is definitely a macro lens, if you also want to do portraits get the 100mm and the 50 1.8. Personally this is a better choice than loosing the 40mm.Overall: amazing lens, you will be satisfied if you are looking to do macro and some portraits if you have enough room (outside). The only reason I give it four and not five stars is the slow AF in darker lighting situations. But you can work around this. Great lens from a great company!"
2141,"These phones are absolutely amazing.  I no longer own a pair of these (I have a smaller pair of Koss headphones), but had them from 1979 and finally updated them about 10 years later.  Now, the plus is that they block out sounds very effectively.  Cueing up a record was easy in a noisy environment (yes, I used records mostly at that time LOL).  The problem with me was that I have a large head and they tend to squeeze a bit.  But they didn't move.  Also, if you're in a warm (or hot) area and perspiring, your ears can get pretty wet in you can't take them off...no breathing under these things.One warning: the bass can be so strong (you don't HAVE to have your audio adjusted like that), it can actually make your ears hurt and you don't even realize how loud it is since the sound is so clean.  Please be careful.The reason I finally got rid of them (gave them away) is that the ear cushions had hardened due to age.  I think at that time, the cushions were hard to come by, and rather expensive.  Decided to just stop using them instead.Buy these...if you find them comfortable, you'll like 'em."
2142,"Terrific headphones with great balance top-to-bottom.  Nice bass, lots of detail, maybe slightly (very slightly) rolled off in the treble.  This is the Shure vMR-TypeV of headphones.  A big plus:  Very efficient so can be used with lower output devices (think iPods and CD players with built-in headphone jacks).  I've compared the Sony's to the Grado-SR80i and I think it's close but they don't sound alike...but then there's the comfort issue:  You wear the Sony's long enough and your ears are going to get sweaty; otherwise I find the Sony's very comfortable.  If you don't like the ear pads, B&H apparently offers velour ear pad replacements (from Pearlstone) that might help.  BTW, I own two of these headphones:  One from ~15+ years ago and a recent pair.  They sound identical."
2143,"I've owned this radio since May and feel I've used it sufficiently long enough to merit a valid opinion. My first radio was a transistor unit back in the early 1960s and I've owned or used countless portable units since. My first reaction upon using this radio was to send it back. Then, after reflecting on the abundance of stellar ratings, I thought maybe I was missing something and needed to give it a fair shake. So, I didn't seek an RMA, but I also didn't feel like the hassle. That said, now having exercised a sufficient amount of cognitive dissonance, I also don't feel bad about having kept it. But one thing drives me crazy, reception while walking. I live in a major population area adjacent to countless powerful radio stations. So signal is not an issue. When trying to walk, one must constantly adjust the ear bud wire which doubles as the antenna. Even presumably stronger stations seem to require antenna adjustment. If you're stationary, you can adjust the antenna and listen without any problems via the unit's speaker or ear buds. I also don't see it's ability to pull in distant signals particularly impressive. Otherwise, sound quality is excellent and the radio is solidly built. It uses two AAA batteries and is easy on power consumption. I see it as a perfect radio for use while working in a shop or to use in the event of power outage. For walking, I now use my MP3 player. Otherwise, I still think it's ok, nothing more, nothing less."
2144,"To start off, these do sound pretty good. They are not very comfortable, just like every on the ear design. One of the earcups on mine fell off at the hinge, snd I cant get it to stay on anymore, so they are unusable now. I dissected and was a little disappointed to find out that they had the exact same speakers as the set of the cheap sets of headphones that came with walkmans way back in the 90's. The speaker is even set in the oblong shaped plastic piece that is used in the walkman headphones. They basically just put bigger earcups over the walkman headphones, making them more uncomfortable and raising the price.Instead, I would get a set that is big enough to go around the ears for comfort reasons. Something like the Sennheiser HD-202's"
2145,I connected this cable between a mini hi fi  and a TV. I got some sound alright but there was a considerable  amount of humming which again is  ok at  lower volumes but  the humming gets amplified greatly when the volume gets  turned up to loud levels.  This might  probably due to the cable not being shielded properly which in turn would  definetly result in a deterioration of the sound quality and furthermore  would  never reproduce sound accurately  if either end of the cable is connected to a device with amplification.
2146,Love these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brands
2147,"Bought these for my wife to use with her Kindle Fire. Good volume and tone, extremely comfortable ear cups and head band, blocks out background noise very well. You'd have to spend double or triple the cost to get a better sounding pair.The only change I'd make is a better adjustment mechanism. The present design &#34;locks&#34; into position when the cups are spreadapart, as soon as you take them off they're free to slide out of adjustment. My solution was to twist tie the top of the plastic yolks tothe two wire bars so there is always tension on the locking mechanism. A spring loaded &#34;T&#34; shaped bar could do the same and be adjustable for a small cost increase."
2148,"My drive has to have power to all pins. This one, as you can see in the picture does not cover all the pins. It may work with an additional lead for the power input (If you can find one that will fit in there. I did not try.).Plus side, I called the seller and told them this, I was told no problem, they credited me for it. Did not even have to return.I would recommend this company, hard to find one that backs up the order!!!"
2149,"Poor quality control.  I've had multiple sets of these over the years and actually prefer them to some of the more expensive ratcheting type crimpers.  This last set, however, had a poorly installed die, so the teeth didn't line up when crimping on a connector.  I just pulled the dies off and stuck them on my old handles.  Works great that way."
2150,"Ditto on the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) reviews that I've seen for this product.  I had read the warnings before buying, but I have a relatively new, mainstream PC that I have never had a single problem with, and figured I would be ok.  The price was right.I installed the software (which checks online for newer versions than what is on the CD...there was none), plugged in the device when asked to by the on-screen prompt, and the machine immediately gave me a BSOD.  When I restarted, the machine would not boot due to a missing DLL file...I went through the recovery process with the Windows XP installation CD (took 30 minutes but seemed to repair the system perfectly), and when I restarted the machine after the recovery I left the webcam plugged in.  I assumed that the recovery would have refreshed any conflicted files and/or drivers, but soon after boot (I later realized that this was when the install program tried to resume) I got another BSOD.Finally I wised up, unplugged the hardware, and restarted the machine (no corrupted OS this time, thankfully).  The installation software again tried to continue and asked me to plug in the device...I chuckled and politely refused, and it crashed soon after.  Windows XP crash reporting informed me that Logitech had informed Microsoft of a solution to this problem...I needed to install the software from their website.  I downloaded it, tried to install it, and got a message that my currently installed version was newer than the one I was trying to install.  It was the last straw...I had given this webcam the benefit of every doubt...so I sent it back.As mentioned in several other reviews...install at your own peril."
2151,"This is a great kit for the hobbyist. I think professionals would prefer a kit that is a little more robust (better insulation, metal) however, this would still get the job done. The only thing that would be nice to add is a desoldering pump.The soldering iron works for simple jobs but I wouldn't say its high quality the tip is wearing out after its first use and you cant hold the iron where you're supposed to during use because it get a bit hot.The flashlight is pretty poor quality I scrapped mine and replaced it with a better one. The solder wick is a nice bonus and works just fine. All the other tools are good and the nut driver is selectable ratcheting and fits well in the hand.I have been using this kit for over six months now and its been a nice and convenient kit"
2152,"Easy to install in a dual G5 Power Mac, no drivers required. The card works fine with OS 10.4.8, but the computer will not go into Sleep Mode if a disk drive is connected to this card (including iPods). The drives will sleep, but not the Mac. The computer will sleep fine if my scanner, card reader (without card) and IR remote are plugged into this card. Also, if you plug your keyboard into the card, you can't wake the computer because the card is ""sleeping"". I checked the ADS website and there are no fixes for the sleep issues. If you can work around the quirks, the card does work."
2153,"I'm an electronics guy with years of radio reception experience and was not impressed with this chunk.Now, I am aware that FM is finicky and you really can't expect any antenna to pull in a station from New York when you live in Chicago, or bring in a weaker station when you live next to a power distribution field. Got that--but Terk sells this thing for $40.00 USD and for that I expect it to do better than fail to pull in ANY station when I plug it in and set my Tivoli Audio Model One to ""External FM Antennna"".With the thing disconnected, I got a couple local stations fine. With it attached and unpowered, one of the two actually sounded a little better! When I powered on, I lost them both and had to bottom out the gain to get them back, though they sounded sucky thereupon. No amount of fiddling ever brought in the local but less powerful station I wanted and for which I bought this in the first place.It's not the end of the world, but I'm returning this one. Moved the radio four feet and problem solved. This antenna should have done better IMHO."
2154,"I used a pair of Sony V300 studio monitor headphones for about 2 years until they became unrepairable.  I didn't realize that this was a blessing in disguise.  I purchased the V600 headphones as a replacement since they addressed my greatest complaint with the V300s: ear compression.  I use my headphones daily to listen to music while working in my cubicle.  This amounts to at least 3 hours of use, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year.  That's at least 780 hours of use per year.  I don't need my ears pressed up against my head by ill-fitting headphones.  The V600s have a circum-aural design that encloses all but the largest of ears.  They're comfy and sound super-fantastic.  I love these headphones!"
2155,The plug works fine. I use it all the time on my stereo and ipod to interchange tham as needed.
2156,of the 10 jewel cases in the package 1 was crackbut still useable. but I'm sure that it will brakeafter a couple of times of open & closing of the case.I just did not want to take the time to return thepackage so I just through it away.
2157,"Over the years I've purchased many Netgear, but in the last three it seems I have port failures on new equipment frequently.  My 9 month old GS108 died a horrid death one day, I kept it on a mondo surge suppressor and have pretty high quality power anyways.  At any rate, I've had other netgear failures, originally consumer quality so I started purchasing the Pro line thinking it would be better.  Not so much.My advice, avoid the brand - they have quality issues.By the way, talked to tech support and the person told me that the problem was using a surge suppressor.  He wanted me to plug it directly into the wall.Honestly, I think they would have replaced the device free of charge, my problem is that their products keep dying.  Better to pay for a product that will last 5-10 years then get another defective product albeit free.  I've switched to d-link, I've had good longevity at a work site with their products."
2158,"What I did not realize before picking this up is that unlike most ergonomic keyboards, this keyboard is completely flat, in fact it almost feels like it is bent in a tiny bit, and doesn't sit comfortably in my hands. And the keys seem strangely sized, especially the space bar and bottom row of keys.Honestly I wish I hadn't gotten rid of the packingm because I went and picked up a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 and am much happier with it."
2159,"When I am playing non-film content, i.e. TV Shows or hybrid content (interlaced + film), the video on the screen will flicker between most quick scene changes. I noticed it alot on ""The Shield - Seasons 1 and 2"" and on DVDs burned from Tivo content.I know its not a bad player because I have 2 of these each bought at different times and they both have this exact same problem.  I have a feeling that it has a hard time with interlaced content, since all hollywood movies (film, 24fps) plays just perfect.I could not find any settings on the player to help alleviate the problem.  I am using the S-Video output.  I have since switched to the new Philips 642 and this DVD player plays everything great, even divx discs.NOTE: The flicker I mentioned was caused by an incorrect setting. If you set the film mode correctly then it plays fine.  So in retroscpect I would give this player a 4 star rating."
2160,"I needed a replacement for broken KSC75 and decided to try these. I didn't find PortPro very comfortable, they press against ears a bit too hard for my taste, so I couldn't wear them for too long. But! The drivers can be easily detached and attached to KSC75's clips! This combination turned out to be very comfortable. Why not just buy cheaper KSC75 then? Well, the sound of PortaPro drivers is a step up. Unlike some other reviewers state, as far as I can tell, the PortaPro drivers are the same as KSC35 and NOT KSC75. They do sound different (to my ear), with PortaPro/KSC35 being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich, warm, bassy (is there such a word?) sound I like so much about KSC75. You may also consider KSC35 which is basically PortaPro drivers with clip-on instead of headband (as far as I can tell Koss only sells them directly from their website)."
2161,"The resistance on these are not compatible with thins like mp3 players or Iphones. Obviously you need a converter to put these in the external output for small devices. The output will not be enough to work these wonderful headphones. These units are made to plug into a receiver with the same size female plug. THEN you listen to one of the best set of headphones ever. Put on these with an extension cord, turn off the lights and listen to music like you have never heard like this before. Yes they are that good."
2162,"Read other reviews for an idea of how the product works as intended when new. My problem is that this product just doesn't last. I've had problems with two of these.The first one failed at the audio output port after a few weeks, where it no longer sent both channels of stereo. And on the other end, exposed cable started to come out of the dock end. So I got another one, and I initially thought I was a happy camper, because the new one's audio out was solid, and the cord never started coming apart at the dock end. However, after a few months, the plastic on the connector recently came apart.Honestly, I don't know if the competing Monster product (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00015GYTU/qid=1126648589/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_unbuck_4/103-9507362-2109467?v=glance&s;=electronics&n;=541966)will be better for me, but it looks like it may be a bit sturdier, and I'd be a fool to try a third one of these Belkin ones. If it was just one bad adapter, I'd be reluctant to say anything negative here, but both of the ones I bought turned out to have issues. Perhaps these things all have a working life of a few months, but I doubt it."
2163,I changed it out and got faster speeds on my network but it's OK and I will keep it as a backup.
2164,"Strengths: Lightweight, easy to use from full automatic to full manual. Depth of field preview (excellent feature!), AE lock, quick auto focus for price range, seven focusing points. Countless lenses and accessories available both from Canon and third party mfgrs. If you have large hands, I recommend the optional battery pack ... which also doubles as a vertical grip with duplicated shutter control and port for remote switch. I simply can't imagine these features on any other camera at a comptetitive price. Thinking about a &quot;point and shoot&quot;? Save your money and get this camera instead.Weaknesses: Included manual not very comprehensive, but spend a few hours with this camera and you can figure most features out yourself. If you need written instructions, I'd recommend the excellent Magic Lantern guide....Also, try another lens, like a 28-200mm aspherical lens, if you want just one lens to carry around."
2165,"Lasted me 3 weeks. Used at the gym 3-4 times a week. The sound's great, super light weight, and easy to carry in a pocket when folded.  However, the wires to each ear are very very thin and fragile.  To be called sports headphones, one would think they were more durable.  Left earphone lost sound and I threw them out."
2166,"Have had this machine for light printing and convenience of fax and scan. Was very happy with it, no big issues.  Then an error code appears that there is a printhead carriage jam (3527).  There was nothing jamming.  Called Kodak got a polite person who was going through the motions. After a  few trials, she says that she needs to check further.  Comes back and says that the unit needs to be replaced but it's out of warranty.  I fully understand the warranty issue. My rating is based on a machine reaching a point where the manufacturer says it needs to be replaced after very light usage.  Even though I've had the machine for about 18 months, I've only gone through 3 sets of cartridges.  Guess I should have printed more so it would have broken down sooner.  The conspiracy side of me wants to say that these machines are ""programed"" for failure.  A very similar issue happened with the HP I replaced with this Kodak."
2167,"I was due for a new set of headphones, and as I despise earbuds, I searched carefully, and found these superb phones from Koss. They are not expensive, yet if you are particular about your music, your  ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce.  I can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the 70's.  They fold closed and come with a leather-like bag.  The bass is clear and not muddy, the highs are clean and not painful to the ear.This model has been in production continiously since 1984 without change!  Koss hit it right with these!"
2168,"I purchased these for my father several years ago as a christmas gift for use in his home studio.  He plays steel guitar, telecaster and records through professional equipment + pro tools.  These deliver an exceptional, above average sound quality that is markedly different than the lower model V150's (which we also have several of).  Over the years, my Dad wore these to bits.  The foam on the earpads was coming off completely and it was time for a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement model that is now available in the stores doesn't compare at all to these.  Thank goodness I was able to get them from Amazon marketplace.  I will probably buy yet another pair and put them away.  A great quality product at a great price!"
2169,Plantronics is always a dependable brand and the quality of sound both incoming and outgoing is just as I expected.
2170,"I purchased these speakers for $99.99 back in 1999 and they are still going strong. I have not have any problems with them except for the fact that that the knobs for the bass and treble controls have fallen off. The controls still work however, but they are a bit harder to turn because the controls are harder to grip.When I got these speakers they were one of the best for that price range. Of course this is no longer the case, but for me I find these speakers more than adequate. The clarity in these speakers is very good, however you will hear some distortion if you have them on full blast with the bass turned all the way up. Keep the speakers at a sensible level and you will soon discover that they are loud and powerful and clear at the same time. Even without the subwoofer, the sattelite speakers can also be viewed as very good speakers despite their small size.For the $100 I spent for these speakers new, I am sure I can get a much better speaker set these days, however I really do not have the need to. The last speaker set I bought was from Wal-Mart, those things did not last over 6 months, it has been 6 years since I bought these and they still work like new. As long as they hold up, I will hold off in upgrading them. Eventhough I am pretty sure you can find these speakers even cheaper, the $60 Amazon has these listed at is still well worth the price."
2171,"These are selling REAL cheaply on Amazon. For under five bucks, you can't even get a meal, but you can get these headphones. So ends the positive things I can say about these headphones.Now for the negatives: Harsh treble, muddy bass, overemphasized midrange, not very comfortable if worn over long periods, kind of ugly and clunky. I can't think of a pair of headphones for less money that's better, if you consider that a recommendation, but for about twice the price (still pocket change) you can get a decent cheap set of Koss KCS75 earphones which are better in every conceivable way to these. I mean, even the junk earbuds that came in the box with your mp3 player are likely better than these.Uh, well, every way unless you WANT ugly and clunky over the ear phones. If you want good over the ear phones, Koss offers those, too, at reasonable prices.If you think ""they can't be THAT bad, and at the price I'll try them"" then I'll remind you that a fool and his money are soon parted, and leave it at that..."
2172,"I knew it worked or not, lol. So far it has kept all my computer parts working, evening while my dumb*** self was working on carpet."
2173,"Considering that you're getting 100 plastic cases for about $20, this purchase is a real bargain! As far as I was able to tell, none of the cases were cracked when they arrived, due to ample air bubble cushioning in the outer shipping container. As an avid photographer who puts all his travelogues and other photos on DVD's and CD's, I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on protecting my entire collection, present and future, so these cases are just fine. They're nothing fancy but quite adequate for their intended purpose."
2174,I never even got to testing the audio quality because the ear piece was so uncomfortable. My ears are on the large side - but not huge - and this didn't fit well at all. I haven't had problems with other around-the-ear headsets but this one is rigid with a tight fit. Putting it on is a two handed operation requiring folding and tucking of ear parts. If I try to take it off with one hand it pinches my ear painfully. I'll be returning it.
2175,"As far as cleaning, I wasn't impressed and that's what I really bought this item for.  The portion dedicated to proper set up of your sound system is pretty good.  If you have a CD/ DVD player that doesn't get much use and you just want something to run through every now and then, this may work fine, for my truck's CD player, it's not cutting it."
2176,The lenses needed adjustment and there were ghosts/double images. My 8x walmart binoculors were better than this expensive piece of equipment
2177,"We returned them.  They are very heavy, you can't hold them still for any length of time.  The word Tripod Adapter is the clue word."
2178,"Mine didn't work, simple as that, not worth the time or hassle to send it back, just went to radioshack and bought one for 10x the price, but at least it worked."
2179,"My biggest complaint is that the local AM stations are not tuning in at the proper number on the dial. Of four regular stations in the area, this radio only picks up two.  The two stations I do get, can be tuned in at the lower numbers on the dial and then again at the higher numbers but not at the number it should be. I have had better luck with five dollar transitor radios."
2180,Do not buy this item if your signal is not all ways excelent.I have prevously owned the two older versions of the netgear 802.11b pci cards and both were much better than this one.Only buy this item if you want a small compact card and you have an excelent signal quality.
2181,"I got these earphones primarily for the in-line volume control and the wind up case.  When I fly, I like to listen to music on my PDA and on those very long flights, I like to watch the occassional DVD.  Before the MX-500, I simply had a cheap pair of philips earbuds that worked okay.  I didn't realize how poor the quality was until I got my MX-500.  Much fuller bass and still very comfortable (I chose not to use the pads that came with it).  My only criticism is that the wire is sometimes too short at 3 ft.  Of course, if they were much longer, I'd be complaining about how long it was..."
2182,These ear phones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good too.
2183,"I've always preferred behind the neck headphones and have been willing to sacrifice a little sound quality for smaller headphones. With these, there is no trade off. They sound great with excellent response and rich bass that isn't overbearing. They weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized head.As for looks and styling.. they sound great!  Then again, if your headphone purchase is based on &#34;fashion&#34;, the help you desperately need won't be found in product reviews."
2184,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).  That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.  Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.  That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex."
2185,"Wow. Just wow. I've owned these for a year now and I must say I'm so glad I bought them. When I bought these I was on a budget of under $100 and now that I have more funds I've been shopping around for something better, but everything I've listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another. Either they're uncomfortable or don't sound as well, but either way I gave up and I have gladly decided to stick with my MDR-V6s. The attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible, especially in a car/plane. You can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat. Only pitfall is my head gets a little warm and my hair gets tussled but I'm ok with it."
2186,"I bought this to connect an iMac to a G4 Mac.  I now know that this cable is restricted to pc computers and does not fit Mac 400.  Also, the packaging is so difficult to open that I had to cut the plastic.  Therefore, I have a cable that is of no use to me which I cannot return.  This information should have been included in the description."
2187,was charged way too much for the item I love hosa cable but these companies jack up the price sell the items for 4 times what the price should be
2188,"Love these, Light weight, excellant high, mid and low ouput. good frequency response. No fatigue. Never realized quality of the Sony MDR-V6 until you buy them. Oh! these are refurbished a steal!! Look new, sound super!! Happy, Happy customer"
2189,"I second what ""An electronics fan"" said.  I went through 3 headsets before finally giving up.  I too was disappointed with the comfort of the earpiece.  They kept coming out when I tried to run.  The first two headsets I had to replace because the rubber ear pad kept falling off.  They stay on for about 2 - 4 weeks but once the thing falls off (and if your lucky enough to not lose it completely) the thing never stays on.  The third head set I added a little super glue two the rubber pieces before using, and that seemed to do the trick, until a couple month later when the left ear piece began cutting in and out.  Don't waist the money; it's not worth the hassle."
2190,"My Kensington Expert Mouse (of the previous generation) finally bit the dust and Kensington was nice enough to give me a replacement - only since they didn't make the Expert Mouse Pro (64213) anymore, they sent this one, which replaced it. I hate it. It KILLS my hand, which suffers from RSI. I had no problem with the previous version. I blame it on being optical. Sure, less moving parts, but they move so weirdly. No matter what setting I used (you can change speed, etc. with Kensington's Mouse Works software), it still was like pushing that trackball through molasses. Didn't feel responsive. Plus, they got rid of the extra 6 macro keys that were handy for launching my favorite apps. Still searching for a good trackball that won't kill my hands. Now I'm wary of all ""optical"" ones."
2191,"Well, you may not necessarily believe that, with all the hype that surrounds Bose, these headphones would be anything other than stellar. They are, unfortunately, very subpar. In truth, these are rather cheap headphones, utilizing very light construction with a predominance of plastics, and very cheap diaphragm materials. The ""Tri-Port"" technology is nothing more than a plastic shield over the diaphragm with three asymmetrical cutouts that capture the sound at different parts along the diaphragm. I suppose that this does help in making a very cheap diaphragm sound better, but it is not a substitute for better materials and higher-quality construction. I expect the Triports cost no more than $20 to make.Many consumers walk into the local Best Buy, try these headphones out, say ""hey, they're great!"" and walk home with a brand new pair. Why is that? Because most people haven't heard higher-quality systems, and compared to what is commonly available at Best Buy, yes, these are a notch above. However, there are several things you should know:1) There are much better sounding headphones that are much cheaper.2) The Triports are defective. The headband design is very flimsy, and is almost guaranteed to break after several months of use. I several friends who own these, and their headbands ALL broke after a few weeks.3) Most of the phones to which these are compared are really terrible. The Sony MDR-V700, against which the Triports are often compared, is a very poor quality phone that isn't designed for home use - it's designed to offer DJ's lots of bass without any regard for detail and clarity. Saying that the Triports are better than the V700's isn't saying much at all.I don't want to tell you that you're all wrong and that I'm all right. I want to say this: use your own ears. Audition real, high-end headphones before you spend $130 or whatever on these, and then decide for yourself what you want to buy. You owe it to yourself to get the best when spending this much money.Here are a few models that I urge you to look at instead of these:1) Sennheiser HD555, 590, 595, and 280 Pro. The HD580, 600, and 650 receive a lot of well-deserved praise, but they need expensive amplification in order to shine, and are in a different league that the Triports, hence, comparing them directly is unfair.2) Sony MDR-V6. Not the MDR-V600! These are very different phones. The MDR-V6 is an older, discontinued model with different drivers that sounds fantastic, unlike the V600, which is very subpar.3) Grado SR-60, SR-80, SR-225. All Grado headphones sound exceptional. The SR-60, at $69, will blow the Triports out of the water.4) Audio-Technica ATH-A500, A700, and A900. These are exceptional Japanese headphones. They're hard to find in the US, but online you can definitely buy them. They compete directly against the Triports, and offer stunning sound quality for the money. They're also very well built and reliable, if slightly bulky.5) If you can, listen to a Stax system. Granted, these systems cost as much as $3,000 for the headphones alone, but this will tell you what a hi-fi pair of headphones SHOULD sound like. Stax headphones are some of the best.For portable headphones that will be used with mp3 players, I suggest that you look at:Etymotic Research ER-4P, ER-6i; Shure e2c, e3c, e4c, and e5c; Westone UM2; Sharp MD-33; Sony MDR-EX51 and EX71; Audio-Technica ATH-CM7 and CM7ti; Koss KSC-35, KSC-75, and PortaPro; Sennheiser HD-25, PX-100 and PX-200; and last of all, Stax SR-001 Mk II, which while hard to find and expensive ($239 Japanese street price), is the best sounding portable available, period (and is the only portable electrostatic headphone in the world). Keep in mind that it needs a mini-to-mini interconnect, since it requires the use of an amplifier (which is included).Use your own ears! I've told you where to start research. Please take the time and finish it. You will be rewarded with a quality product, and you will be grateful for the time that you spent researching the information.For questions, please look at [...] It is an excellent source of information on anything and everything headphone-related.I sincerely hope this helps."
2192,"I was deployed to Kuwait/Iraq earlier this year and decided to pick one of these up in the states at my mobe station before flying out here (I'm still here). I have a lot of mixed feelings with this product. I have also put this product through endless abuse and have a good idea of its downfalls.The two places I use this player is indoors, in barracks but usually in a living tent. The other place is on missions, I bring this in the hummer or whatever vehicle I'm in to listen to music on long drives (since we don't normally get radios in the vehicles). On these trips, the system has to put up with hot weather ranging from dry to very humid, a lot of dust and sand (sometimes in sandstorms), exposure to sun, and long operation (sometimes over 8 hours in a day).The system has mostly held up. Indoors, the sound is pretty decent and has some good bass. My biggest complaint with the sound is lack of eq control. On trips, with all the background noise and movement, the ESP holds up really well (hardly ever skips), turning off the bass-boost clears up the sound at loud volumes, and the jog stick works well. One problem that I have had in the past few months though, is that it starts acting up sometimes and will skip on any CD. It doesn't always do this, but there have been a few days where it just couldn't play a CD without severe skipping throughout each track. It seems to get worst on the final tracks. Indoors, it rarely does this. The headphone amp works great, I can crank up the volume pretty high on some high power consumption headphones with no problem. The jog stick comes in handy at night or when I'm not looking.By far the biggest problem is reading mp3 files and CDRs. My unit has read certain mp3 discs ok, but it has problems reading a lot of my mp3 discs. It also has problems with the slightest spec of dust. Even with some brand new burnt CDs it has problems. I have a Philips exp431 mini cd mp3 player, and it can read the same CDs much better. If there are any scratches, it can skip over them and will never skip since it reads the whole file at once rather than continuously spinning and reading like the Sony does. If the Sony gets caught on an mp3 file, it emits a horrible hissing and scratching sound and often locks up or freezes on the file. It gets annoying. If this system could read files like my other mp3 player and hold up on other CDRs without skipping, it would get 5 stars. I almost wish I bought the Philips mp3 boombox instead. It doesn't look like it can handle as much abuse, but I feel that their method of reading mp3s is far superior.The units took a lot of beatings, dirt, water, moisture, and heat, and it still works. If you are looking for a really tough CD boombox and don't care for mp3s so much, then buy it. Out here, we have seen a lot of other boomboxes and mp3 boomboxes from companies like RCA and cheap brands sold in the PX that couldn't hold up in the conditions out here and quickly broke."
2193,"I installed this switch in a home network with four PCs and a network-based printer. All in-wall wiring and patch cables had been upgraded to Cat6 wiring. I am an expert user with over 15 years experience setting up networks.After running for a few minutes, all of the lights on the GS108 would start flashing on/off/on/off once per second, including lights on ports that were disconnected.  All of the PCs connected to the GS108 would report that a ""network cable was disconnected.""I contacted Netgear support. This is apparently a common problem because Netgear didn't even ask me to troubleshoot anything. As soon as I described the symptom, they said they'd need to replace it.Netgear offered me the choice of inexpensive ground shipping (7 to 10 days to receive the new unit) or a very expensive price for an overnight replacement. There was no middle ground such as two or three day shipping.The replacement I received had the same problem.This problem has been reported by other users on other sites. Given Netgear's inability to solve the problem and their ridiculous shipping rates to replace a critical network component, I recommend staying away from this GigE switch.I threw away the GS108 and purchased a Dell PowerConnect 2708, which costs 50% more but has better performance and includes free overnight replacement shipping if you run into a problem. The 2708 has run flawlessly since I plugged it in."
2194,"My ps/2 converter that I have had for ages (10 years) finally died. I bought this as a simple one for one replacement in order to share my keyboard between 2 towers.  IT DID NOT WORK despite plugging it in exactly the same way as my last one. I have trouble-shooted until smoke blew out of my brain and I give up!  The company is lucky - for this price point, no one will bother to return it."
2195,"I just got these recently after reading all the reviews here.  The others aren't lying, these headphones are unbelievable.  I find them extremely comfortable, and don't think they feel heavy like others have said.  The build quality is top notch, and feel like they could last for the 10-15 years that others' have.As far as the sound goes, they seem to do better with real music than fake.  Basically, if you're listening to classical, jazz, acoustic, vocals or classic rock, I can't imagine anything could ever reproduce sound better.  I've listened to Led Zeppelin for 20 years, and now I'm re-listening, hearing (and feeling) subtle sounds I never heard before.  They'll almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albums.Where they seem to fail is with fake music, such as rap, hip hop, or anything else created with synthesizers or computers.  If that sort of non-music is your thing, you may be better off with the Dre headphones.  If real music is what you listen to, you absolutely have to buy these."
2196,"The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier."
2197,"This is my second pair of headphones. There is absolutely NO comparison with the first, because this one has to be approximately 284x better. The bass, like everyone said, is crisp and clear, but not exactly booming with the lows. In other words, it's not the same as car subs. The sound quality, however, is absolutely incredible. I'm able to hear certain noises in music and gaming that I haven't ever heard from my speakers.The headphones aren't technically noise cancellation, but I can't hear a single thing anyone is saying when they're standing next to me. I don't even have the noise that loud!There are a couple complaints I have about this product, but they are minor. First, the design of the headphones are shaped to fit ones ears. Because of that, it isn't possible to wear them the other way. Luckily, the cord is very long and coils up so it won't tangle up. The second complaint I have is that my ears become extremely hot and uncomfortable after just 30 minutes or so. To combat that, I just take them off for a good 10 seconds and it's fine again. It does get annoying though.I'm no audiophile so I can't judge the quality in comparison to other headphones, but I would MOST CERTAINLY buy this product again."
2198,a twofer for RJ-11's.  Its kind of tan in color.  Its got lots of little shiney wire thingys inside of it.
2199,"If you're ok with using JUST your mouse on one PC and/or JUST your keyboard on another, this is kinda fun.  Otherwise, avoid it.  Maybe I just got a bad one, of course, but I can assure you as a QA engineer that mine is no good."
2200,"The following is an except of a review that I wrote for the CX-450, the predecessor of the CX-455.  I downloaded the user manual for the CX-455 to make certain that this essential part was applicable, and that seems to be the case.For me, the natural way to find the disc that I want to play is to begin by selecting the artist name, and then peruse the titles by that artist.  The capability that comes closest is the Artist Mode.  From the player, you press the ""Artist Mode"" button.  You use the jog dial to scroll through the list of artist names, and when you find the one you want, you press in on the jog dial.  That engages Artist Mode, which changes the behavior of the perusal techniques that use the player's display, so that titles not by that artist are skipped.  This capability is useful, but is hindered by the fact that it is tied in to the Artist Mode.  The Artist Mode capability is intended to give you a way to play multiple discs by the same artist, with tracks shuffled if you like.  You can use it to facilitate finding and selecting discs by a specific artist, but as soon as you select an artist different from the one currently playing, the disc currently playing stops, and the player commences playing the first disc by the other artist that you select.  This is aggravating when you want to peruse titles by a few other artists before making your selection.  The bottom line is that this player lacks a good way to select a disc by starting with the artist and then perusing the discs by that artist."
2201,"I use this little bag to carry my cell phone, a couple batteries, and memory card. It attaches to my ClikElite backpack just fine. For the most part it's a well made bag. However, the Velcro and snap aren't very strong and will come loose and the bag will fall off. It's happened to me twice in the last couple of months. Fortunately I saw it fall off both times and luckily didn't lose it. This one is less than a year old so it really shouldn't have this problem already."
2202,"I don't use it much but it does allow me to use the extra lenses that went with a much larger SLR camera.Worth buying if you need to use a larger lens than is on the camera.Mine is an Olympus Camedia C 765 Ultra Zoom, an older one with 10 X zoom. I love it. Birds in tree tops look like they are 10 feet away.Annie"
2203,"I was told to get this by a professional picture taker. I was taking pictures of snow covered hills and the Sun was ruining my shots. This is very light and thin, about 1/4 inch thick. The filter is two parts, each about 1/8 inch thick and bonded together with the ability to rotate the front part. Make sure to screw the filter snug into your lens, then you can spin the front 1/8 inch thick part. It is a polarizer and must be rotated as you view your subject through the camera. As you turn the filter clockwise, you will see the glare disappear and if you keep going you will mess up your shot. This is a quick learning device and fun to play with.I remove it for indoor shots and Moon shots."
2204,"If you have a fixed location this should do the trick, the extra wires with a laptop can be a pain.Switching from the phone to the computer is a little awkward at times especially with the mute function.Using this with Inter-Tel phones and Plantronics headsets.  Sound quality is great, connections weren't an issue (follow the cabling requirement guides)"
2205,"Got this to allow 2 kids to use their headsets for mobile viewing of tablet. Sometimes mommy needs quiet time, so kids get ipad video time.  Previous hack of one ear bud per person was not working, especially for stereo productions like movies.  That hack also forced too much unappreciated physical togetherness.  This splitter works great!"
2206,"This is the best splitter I've used, saying that I constantly have to keep the headphone jack just right in the inputs or the sound is off."
2207,"If you are living in a big city whit lot of FM Station... maybe will not work clear... and the sign lost quality, remenber is a FM sign... not a Digital Sign... If you can, use a cable..."
2208,I use this to supplement my headphones when I am watching TV at home.  I get better sound quality through the headphones and am able to sit a good distance from the screen.  Another big plus: they minimize tangling when I hide the cord behind the console.
2209,Ordered from EforcityBattery was not brand advertised nor 1300MAH  cheap knock-off
2210,"For the price, you can't beat this little headset.  The mute switch sets it apart from other headsets, which is a must-have feature for conference calls.It is also comfortable, and in my expererience, fairly durable.  I've used this headset for 2 years with no complaints.  In fact, I'm listening to a conference call on it right now. :-)"
2211,"This software is ok, but it's not worth the money.  It does a terriable job with roofs (won't calc. rafter and jack sizes on a hip roof).  Finding stuff is really hard.  I can't find roof vents.  Took me forever to get used to the user interface and I'm an advanced pc user.  Can't find where you can add an overhand on a roof.....  to much to list."
2212,"I have owned Sony's MDR-V200 headphones for years; the sound quality was okay, but they always hurt my ears and weren't at all comfortable. Then the ear pads stared to deteriorate and leave black specks on my ears and face. Instead of spending too much money for replacement pads I decided it was time to buy a new set of headphones. After doing some research and reading reviews I bought my first set of MDR-V6 Monitor Series headphones. I'm happy that I did. The sound is better than my old ones and they are very comfortable on my ears. Also, the price was reasonable. From the reviews, I realize not everybody agrees on quality and comfort. All I can do is express my own experience. I'm very satisfied with these and recommend them. I understand that these pads will deteriorate, also. You'd think that Sony could make pads that won't fall apart after a few years use.Update:These ear pads are starting to deteriorate and get loose, also. SONY!, please improve your quality control and make ear pads that last! I can buy replacements, but I shouldn't have to. I never DID find replacement pads anywhere for the MDR-V200 headphones that weren't more expensive than buying new headphones. /rant"
2213,"What can you say?  It is a device that fans out 4 outputs, from 1 input.And I thought, for the most part that; A hub is a hub is a hub, right?Given that  Tripp lite is a well known brand; this must be a good product, right?While I have used these without any issues personally, and they seemed to be an average USB hub.(Nothing special, but also nothing problematic).We bought about 15 of these USB hubs (maybe 20), and for the most part, they worked okay.However, a couple of my end users had overheating problems.1. an end user was charging his mp3 player.He smelled a burning smell, and noticed the hub's lights were out.The hub itself was slightly bulged, (like it had developed a blister the size of a quarter)and the hub felt hot.He removed power. The hub had died.We discarded the hub.2. A second end user was using the hub to transfer data, and it just died.It too had an overheating problem; being warm/hot to the touch.That hub was also trashed.The remaining usb hubs are still in use; a few years later.Looking at the percentages, I'd have to say it is an ""average"" USB hub.Because it is small, I can understand that overheating could become an  issue.The usb chassis should have had more air holes/slots, for cooling.The unit has a 3 year warranty.But that is more for marketing, than for the end user's piece of mind.Who would spend 8 or 10 bucks to ship a warrantied item back?And then have the company send the same type product [and it might even be refurbished]Something this cheap, you would buy a new unit and pitch the old; regardless of any warranty."
2214,This is a great cable if you are cramped on space and need to move your printer to a distant location. works for me!
2215,"Good quality filter, metal and glass construction. So many of the lower cost filters these days have plastic mounts, but this one feels like brass. Threads on and off easily without being too loose. Seems to be pretty tough, although I haven't drop-tested it yet. Since it's not a warming polarizer, it cools colors slightly, but on most days I like that."
2216,The volume control stopped working quite soon - works in certain positions only. The soft covers deteriorated very quickly. Two stars for a relative comfort.
2217,"I bought this router and it worked well... for a while.  Now it will frequently just stop working.  I find that this usually happens when I am not actively using it.  I will come home from work and have no internet connection until I unplug the router.  Also, it seems to run very hot.Setup is fairly easy and the interface isn't that bad, but having to unplug it every couple of days is highly annoying.  I would not suggest buying this router unless you want a headache."
2218,"I am unbelievably frustrated by this product.  I had this connected to a firewall to connect two computers into a subnet.  Every 5 to 15 minutes the switch simply disconnects everything attached to it.  At the switch all lights except power are turned off.  The only way to recover the network is to power the switch off and on, and then the problem repeats again in 5 to 15 minutes.I tried removing each computer from the switch to see if that changed the result and it did not.  I then tried to swap a brand-new-in-box GS108 in as a substitute and I get the identical result.  So the defect is in the unit's firmware or in its design, but such a gross defect from a major network company is totally unacceptable.Do not entrust this switch to any mission critical task.  I had to come into the office at 1am on Sunday night to debug this and find a reliable temporary substitute."
2219,Too much room tone if your laptop's fan isn't dead silent.  Ends up creating lots of feedback chirping in Skype.
2220,"Amazing headphone value.  If you want big booming bass, pick up a set of V-Moda Crossfades.  If you want to hear subtle nuances in your music which you never new were there before, then these are the phones for you.  Very light and incredibly comfortable to boot.  Quite honestly, I can't imagine how someone could complain that these give a tight fit.  I generally use these with my Nuforce Icon DAC, Google Play Music, and my Toshiba Chromebook.  However, I think they shine the best when using the DAC along with my Onkyo C7030."
2221,The price is right and this is as good as any of the more expensive ones I have used on my primary camera and the backup cameras.
2222,"Much sturdier than the porta pros, which I've had and used for a couple years. To me, the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros, but I admit I do not hear very well. That doesn't mean i can't tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair, but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality. These however look much nicer I think, and appear as though they will last a lot longer too. Of course they come with lifetime warranty, so when they break down (which my porta pros often did) just mail them to the company on the box with $6 and they'll send you a replacement pair pretty quickly."
2223,"These are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish. OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both."
2224,"Though this card, 32 megs is minute, you still may only need that. I picked this up (about 4 1/2 years ago), when it was state of the art & about sixty bucks or so. I still have both cards! Well over 4,000 photos & bazillions of files!! Never a read or write error! I've never lost anything with it. Unlike the Lexar!If you're looking into compact flash cards, go with who started it. I have a 128mb sandisk, & am now looking into their 2 gig Ultra card, for my new camera. Because I want speed, & need the space for 8MP photos.The write/capture function is slow, it's not meant for speed. But for swapping & transferring it's faster than from cd (with the right reader/writer)!SD cards & micro drive are inching in, but Sandisk keeps imporoving the CF (they also make SD cards).There are cheaper & less expensive cards out there, but how important is your data/photo? You can't always retrieve your files, with the flash memory programs. I know. I used three of them on my Lexar, & NEVER got all of the images. But that just may be the cards I have, who knows? There isn't any quality control any longer, who cares? Sandisk is the most accurate."
2225,"Seems like a pretty well made cable.It did not work for my HP 712C printer, which is about the same as the 710C. I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.There is actually a Driver for this cable on the TRENDnet site, but it is old. For Windows 98/ME. This driver will not work with a 64-bit system."
2226,"I bought the exact same spindle at office depot, for only 5 dollars (I now know why they were so cheap).  I have a 32x burner and tried to burn several at that speed (the cd's are supposed to be 48x compatible) none of them were readable.  I had to burn at 4x for any of the cd's to work!  I would suggest instead buying Memorex, I've found spindles of 50 cd's for $10 in some stores, and I've never had a single bad cd.  I'm surprised by the quality of Sony's cds especially since I've read elsewhere that they are supposed high quality."
2227,"For the most part I am pleased with it; if it had cost more I would have returned it. Maybe it is my own set up and equipment. The IR transmission signal gets interference from the TV set. If I turn the TV set off, the Terk Remote Extender works flawlessly. Some times it works without a problem, others not; not 100% reliable. I tried plugging it in different electric outlets, as they recommend, and it didn't do it. I bought it mainly for operating my DirecTV satellite receiver. Perhaps it is the DirecTV receiver; if the receiver's IR sensor is somewhat blocked by the Terk's little sensor detector that you place in front of the component, when having problems with transmission, as Terk recommends, the remote won't work. Finding the right ""angle"" to place this little sensor is tricky and time consuming. Perhaps telephone signals also interfere with the transmission. In any case, it could be better."
2228,Yes for more money you can getm ore quality. But im the type of guy that goes for the best quality at the best price and these fit the bill. Produces nice clear sound and actually has some bass to it. the phones cover my ears entirly which is what i wanted since im using these in my bedroom to listen to tv while my girlfriend sleeps and theres normally fans or a air purfier on. Work great. I did use them on a plane ride and found that the small earbuds the plug your ear canal shut out way more engine noise. So in that case make sure the device you are using can out out some high volume or you may not be able to hear clearly.
2229,"Just bought one from [local store] for [$$] after rebates.  The web setup is easy. I hooked it up with a Win98 PC and a WinXP notebook.  Both works.  The DHCP took a minute to obtain the ip address from the router.  So, be patient the first time you hook it up.  Port 4 worked for an hour and failed.  I think it's the connector problem.  I think there is a quality issue."
2230,"When i spliced this product in to my line, the right speakers stopped working. When I replaced it, all speakers work. Conclusion, this coupler was a waste of money."
2231,"I bought these speaker connectors to use on the Monster brand THX speaker wires.  The crimpable gold connectors are ok, however, the rubber cover sleeve is average at best.  What I can't understand is the amount of loose-ness of the rubber sleeves when they are designed to stretch to fit almost any thickness speaker wire.  Thus, the rubber sleeves on my Monster brand 16-gauge (standard thickness) speaker wires are very loose making me concerned that the exposed speaker wire will corrode over time due to the exposure to air caused by the loose rubber sleeves.  I can't believe Monster didn't design the opening of these sleeves to be narrower so that the rubber can stretch a little and form a tight fit with the speaker wires."
2232,"Good functional keyboard, not the  easiest to type on, nothing compared to a wireless Microsoft keyboard but acceptable.  Easy to store and carry around."
2233,"When I bought this, I thought I had bought a set of gold plated diamond necklace.  Sony packaged it like it was a limited edition.  I paid 50 bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around 75.  Very solid sound and great for monitoring, I thought about needing a 300 dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you won't get more out of a more expensive set than this.  I'm not sure what's the difference between this and MDR7506 but I can only image how awesome the professional ones are though."
2234,"Received it as a present. Had no problems with the software or drivers (other than it could be slightly better to use).  Without an SD card it's pretty worthless, almost no memory.  So figure that you'll need to spend as much on a memory card as you do on the camera.  The picture quality is decent, low light is horrible, but that much is expected for the price.  HOWEVER, after 1-2 weeks of minimal use the camera is now in a continual reboot mode where even the slightest movement causes it to power off and on over and over.  This is without dropping it or damaging it in any way.  Customer support is fairly useless and non-responsive.  Avoid this clunker."
2235,"My first impression when I took this camera out of the box was that they forget to put the guts in the cheap plastic shell that holds this thing together. I've never owned a ""pro"" camera that is so cheaply constructed. It feels like it's ready to break at any point and will no way hold up to the beating a wedding or other pro work will subject a camera to. It doesn't get any better in use. The camera is built on a Nikon F80, a consumer body, that has been jerry rigged with electronics from Fuji. It features an itsy bitsy viewfinder that's like looking down a tunnel. The focusing screen doesn't have any split viewfinder for manual focusing, which is an absolute requirement for this thing because its autofocus system is pathetic, unreliable and simply doesn't work right. Exposure is likewise eratic.With a lot of work and a lot of luck, nice images can be produced. But if you want reliability and consistency, forget this camera.Also, don't even think about it if you want to shoot handhold below 1/125. Anything below that, and I get blurred images thanks to the lightweight body and lack of internal dampening. This is the worst body I've ever owned for camera shake problems. I have the D1H at work and can shoot at 1/15 of second with it and no blur. The Fuji would produce a fuzzy mess at that.Also, don't even think about using a cheap lens on this thing. It demands great glass. We're talking ED lenses to get ""pro"" results. It also wants Silent Wave motor focusing on the lenses.In short, buy this camera and you'll be facing an endless pit in which you'll toss money for batteries, cards, lenses and backup.Buying this camera made me appreciate my Nikon F4s bodies all the more."
2236,"If you have a Dymo Letratag, you pretty much have to buy their brand of tape.  It's a bit pricey per inch.  For anything exposed to sunlight, even indirect sunlight, either the black will fade or the white will turn brown or both within 1-3 years."
2237,I have had to unscrew and screw this wire back in numerous times it keeps slipping out of position and effecting the sound/picture quality. It's not that much of an inconvenience but the fact it won't just stay in place is a bit of a pain.
2238,Maybe if I was a professional photographer I would buy a different product but this is good for me at a very reasonable price.
2239,It's made with cheap materials and it can't hold big cameras with big lenses.  If you have a SLR with cameras up to 70-300mm (5.6/6.3) I would say to buy it. For bigger lenses it`s not the ideal.It`s really high and have some interesting features...
2240,"Good cable for the price. As noted by other users, its snagless design can make removing the plugs difficult, and the plastic jacket is easy to harm. Although, neither of these should be of any real problem for everyday use."
2241,"I'm pretty advanced with computers, but I could never get this print server to work right. It wouldn't work when I tried to print through the network -- only when I was attached directly to the print server. The setup was just too long and had some complicated steps that didn't make much sense. I'm sure if I called technical support it would have eventually worked.So I finally went out and bought the Netgear WGPS606 -- a wireless print server that costs a little more. But it was worth it. The entire setup was automatic and I was up and running on two computers within minutes. That's the way it should be."
2242,I purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also. For the price they are great and I have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use. They have held up great and if they ever do fall I'll replace them with the same unit.
2243,I had endless problems backing up to Sony CD's. Switched to TDK and almost always works fine. Stay away from Sony CD's.
2244,"We were looking for a nice sturdy set of headphones that our 7 year old wouldn't break in a matter of minutes.  Not only do they sound great and block a large amount of ambient sound, the single cord on the left side is nice and thick.  We don't have to worry about the chair rolling over the cord.  The chair could probably roll over it a few dozen times with no fear of breaking.  For the price, this is a wonderful sturdy set of headphones."
2245,I have had these for about a year. I also have M35.POOF! no sound! I have never had a pair of headphones to go out completely. Some had shorts in the wire. Some fizzled. Never POOF! No Sound!
2246,headphones are terrific!  sound quality is great.  a little tight but with a little adjustment they are very comfortable.  will be using them at Texas Motorspeed Way in Nov.  the stereo mono switch is nice feature. will also use them when I am using my backpack blower instead of just earplugs.
2247,"I bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments.  They block the majority of noises, including traffic, people yelling, stereo/television noise from next door.  They won't block out loud noises in the same room (e.g. loud TV or person yelling), but I think that's good because you want to be aware of dangers nearby!I'm no audiophile, but the sound that comes through these headphones sounds just like the quality that comes out of my stereo.They fit a little differently from most headphones, with the connecting bar fitting behind your head rather than sitting on the top of your head.  I don't know if this would affect people who wanted to use these headphones while moving (e.g. commuting or exercising), but for those of us sitting down while wearing them, they are very comfortable."
2248,"The Tamrac wallet works well and cleverly for what it was designed for -- carrying extra batteries and memory cards and allowing the user to know which have been used -- and that should be enough for most people. Me, I bought it to carry four CompactFlash memory cards (in their cases), and that's it. However, I can't give it 5 stars if it doesn't suit my particular needs.I like traveling with as little volume as possible, and find that the wallet is too bulky to fit well in my camera bag alongside my Olympus camera body, lenses, spare batteries, and other photography odds and ends. Getting a larger camera bag would defy the purpose of trimming volume (and would make no sense, since this wallet is the one item that always ends up getting shuffled around in it), so I tried two very compact Hakuba cases for two CF cards each, which I acquired in Adorama. These are working far better, as they are small enough to fit anywhere in the camera bag and I can clip them to the camera strap or belt strap.If you don't have a space issue, this Tamrac wallet should work well for you. If you do, I suggest looking for other solutions."
2249,After a 2nd try I received the same product. I left a detailed message about what I thought I was getting. I wanted the sizing of AAA and received AA.
2250,This came apart the first time I removed the cap.  It is glued together and the glue just pulled apart and I tried to take the cap off.
2251,Works.  Connected cable modem phone line and printer fax.  Clicks in secure and jacks fit well.  Would've been astounded if it had not worked.
2252,"The functionality is there, and its hard to beat the price.  It does what its supposed to do.  Flip the switch one way and you can use your headset.  Flip the switch the other way and you can use your speakers.  One of the issues I ran into is that when the switch is in the headset position, the speakers hum.  When I switch to speaker mode, the hum goes away.  Also, the microphone only works when the switch is in the headset mode.  So I only use the switch for the speakers and headset and leave my microphone plugged directly into the computer."
2253,"This is a great product, it contains everything you will need, the cord stays nice and tight until your ready to use it and then stores up in a tight package."
2254,my brother is a guide for fishing and he asked me to purchase for my camera so he can take me out and capture video and photos of fish in the water.  I have not had a chance to use this yet but hope I will soon.
2255,"These headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price. I own a few pairs of quality headphones, including a pair of Etymotic er4p's. The Koss Sporta Pro 'phones sound great and the price is fantastic. The bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well. These 'phones are worth the price, and then some."
2256,"I think the Koss Pro-4AA headphones were the phones of choice for Noah on his ark - they've been around a LONG time. And contrary to some longstanding products that stick around in spite of newer, more technically advanced competitors simply because a bunch of eccentrics swear by them, these phones are a fabulous choice for anyone at any time.And now the pros and cons...Cons:1) Heavy, heavy, heavy. Watch your neck.2) If you have a large head, these phones can give you headaches as the headband design puts a lot of pressure on your temples and ears.3) The coiled cord has a tendency to increasingly pull on one side of the phones as you get closer to its length limit. That this starts to happen around the halfway point is troubling.4) Not a stylish set of phones. Almost retro in appearance. The ill green color could have been changed long ago.5) The earpiece's circumaural seals are filled with air and will deflate if punctured. This is the Achilles heel of the phones.6) The cord cannot be easily replaced. If you get a short, you're done for.Pros:1) Superior, extended frequency range. Clean and flat. Still the best sounding phones I have heard in their price range. Sounds as good as phones that go for twice the price.2) Circumaural, closed design holds in the thunderous bass and stifles the outside world.3) Still the choice of many professionals. It's amazing how many DJs continue to use this model.4) The price is outstanding for the quality of sound delivered.5) Built like a tank. My first pair lasted ten years of constant use. (They never did break down, I replaced them for another reason.)For a home system, this is a fine set of cans. If you want something portable, look elsewhere. Consider buying a cord extension, too, if you plan to sit somewhere else besides right near your stereo. And let people know that with them on, you'll be in your own musical world for a while. Sit back and enjoy!"
2257,This product did not work at all and with multiple ethernet cables and computers. I believe all the ports where bad.
2258,"The quality of sound from these phones is fantastic. Easily set-up, wonderful sound.Thanks."
2259,"I've never used a top-of-the-line circular polarizer, but I'm happy enough with the results from this one that I don't think I will ever upgrade much above this one. It's stayed free of scratches and cleans easily in the field.Used with various Canon EF L-Series lenses, you can see sample images at 500px.com/seannmhogan"
2260,It worked pretty good when I bought it a couple of years ago. Apparently the manufacturer made there money and quit supporting this remote. It works for a lot of standard and older Windows programs but has no support for any programs made in the last 3 years. It looks like they are still selling this to make easy money but it has no support for newer programs. Good programs like J. River Media Center just give you a message that it is not supported. If you go to their web site you will find that no updates have been made to their software in 5 years.
2261,We have a kitchen radio where several AM stations contain a lot of static.  This despite us being in a good location (on a hill with the radio towers visible).  I figured I would try this.  It made no difference.  I suspect there's some sort of interference or that some of our aluminum siding (on part of the house) is causing the problem.  The radio also has no antenna connector -- just the built-in antenna -- which limits my options.  I returned this since it didn't work for me.  The return process with Amazon was painless.
2262,"I bought this radio after reading the other reviews that was listed for this item. I thought I was getting a good radio. Boy, was I wrong! In all fairness, the FM band is pretty good. I'm assuming that the AM band is good too (if I wanted to listen all day to talk radio). The TV band does not pick up the stations at all--no matter what I do. Also, what I really wanted the radio for was the Weather band so that I'd know what was going on when the power went out. Well, guess what--NO WEATHER BAND EITHER! Can't pick up anything!I feel that if I either wanted to listen all day to talk radio on the AM band or pick up a few stations on the FM band, this radio would have been great. But when you have bad weather coming in and you want to know what is coming your way, this definately is NOT the radio to get. I feel I have wasted my money on this purchase!"
2263,These quit working in less than 3 months of use!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!! They are just junk now collecting dust in my home. I will never buy another Audio-Technica product again!
2264,"The tool selection is OK, now the quality of the driver is definitely lacking, it has a ball that is used to retain the bits, the ball kept falling out causing the bit to also fall out. The vendor offered to replace it, but can see its a cheap design, I just got a better driver from Craftsman and use for the rest of the kit.  The only other thing, I wish the Anti Static strap was a little longer so could also put on my ankle and out of the way, but it is a WRISTSRAP after all so can't fault them for that."
2265,"If you bought the most expensive headphones you can, they would not be a lot better than these. The price was great. They got to my house five days before promised. Overall the sound quality, price, and speed of delivery were all reasons to come back to Amazon."
2266,it's like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and quality.definitely won't regret owning this
2267,"These headphones are great. You can't find anything else that sounds this good in this price range. Koss does stereophones right!I have had my UR-20s for more than a year. They still sound great and have been stuffed into my backpack almost every day since i bought them. One of my size adjuster clips has broken, but it is no doubt due to my reckless use. Even broken, they fit comfortably on the head.The ear cups are big enough for anyone's ears. They cover your ear completely and do not &quot;crowd&quot; your ear like the smaller UR-29s do.The bass is amazing and the insulating ring makes such a close seal with your head that you will not hear anything while you have these headphones on. I don't like listening to music while I sleep, but I have used these headphones as noise reducers (without playing any music) on many occasions and bus rides.Note that these headphones are larger than most. This is probably why they sound so great. I especially like that the headband is made of rubber coated metal to keep the phones close to your head, with a cloth balancing strap below that to make it comfortable in any situation.Koss is the king as far as affordable, amazing stereophones go. Buy the UR-20s and you'll be glad you did. I have had no problems."
2268,"I must say the product do what it is mean to doBut I have been using it for a week and I still don't get use to glare the screen madeI have try using backwards whit the gold side looking inside the screenI still provide Privacy but know with a dark glare (instead of the golden one)the Dark glare is less disturbing but still to glossy for me.Also what I don't like is that the privacy filter works only to block people next to you, and not above you or far next to you."
2269,Never bought it the co that sold it to me didn't know what they were doing so I figured if they didn't know about a 499 lens maybe I should leave it alone.
2270,"I like the camera very much.  What is especially nice about it is the size.  Yes it is rather large, but that is a plus when you are a large handed person and this is one of the most comfortable cameras that I have tried out to handle.  The buttons aren't microscopic and the lens makes a pleasant handhold also.  Smaller is not always better.The one thing I do not care for is the response time when taking a picture and also when viewing pictures that have been taken.  The camera also tends to get a little testy when you try to do close ups.Otherwise, lovely."
2271,My family is hard on headphones. This is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months. The Koss PortaPros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound. Highly recommended.
2272,"These provide excellent sound, comfort and they are fairly durable. A very good sound experience for the price."
2273,"This is a good camera for infrared photography.Just get yourself a 49mm infrared or red filter and have at it.About the only thing I didn't care for was the reset option on the onoff switch, don't know why they did that. Nice glass, real nice."
2274,"Sony MDR-V6 headphones are by far the best headphones out there for the money. I listened to Audio Technica and Dr.Dre's Beats headphones and In my opinion the Sony cans sound the best. The Dynamic range is Great. Good Bass, Clarity at the same time. I use mine with ""cMoy Headphone Amplifier"" and it shines truly with it. I am using it from last 12 yrs and I enjoyed it all these years. I am happy to see Sony still makes them. I will definitely order one more headphones for my family members.Pros:Excellent sound stage, Great Highs and Lows. Amazing.Very Comfortable HeadphonesExcellent Build quality, Very sturdy using excellent materialsHeadphone coil is protected by Metal shieldSpring type wire - very usefulFrequency range of headphones is comparable or better than much high end expensive headphonesNo Distortions, No Loose connection problems, No Rust after using for 12 yrs (Replaced ear pads 3 timesin 12 yrs)Love the Matte Black finish on the headphonesCons:None Noticed"
2275,"Any potential buyer should know that this product is not really worth the price from its quality.The hand rest gives a bad smell and the body of this device produced from low quality plastic.Overall the device is workable and  working fluently on both my Mac and Windows machine. A really special feeling using this very big trackball.Note:1. This trackball is for someone with a big palm2. The quality is not as goog as expected a $80 product.3. If you never use a trackball before, it will take some time to get used to it.(I owned this product for three weeks now)"
2276,"I don't know if it is dry-rotted or if they're all this way, but the cleaning tip not only leaves black pieces of suede or whatever it is made of, but leaves black streaks anywhere you use it.  I rubbed my finger across it, and my skin was stained black.  Returning immediately."
2277,I bought this from Amazon specifically for my twenty hour airline journey. Most of my music I hear is lossless format on IPOD (converted from CD using EAC software). I am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality. I am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones. The bass is well defined.The headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well :-)I will definitely recommend these headphones to friends.Lastly the price just blew me away ! Koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a Music Jedi :-) May the force be with Koss.
2278,"I'm very happy with this headphones, however I can't take them to my office. I just enjoy them in my bed and feel in a concert. Great seller, beautiful sony package."
2279,"Bought these at the suspiciously low price of $8.99. Are they Chinese ""fakes""? If so, the quality is very good.Pro's: Excellent 5-star sound for most types of music -- the bass is very good, just not mega (buy the Sonys for that)!! Delivers high volume with minimal distortion. Convenient inline volume control. I liked the unequal cords because they allow placement behind the neck, and are less obstructive.Con's: earphones too large for my ears, hence 4 stars only; left bud kept slipping out (so I have one small eardrum!).Overall, a good replacement set of earphones for my broken Sandisk M240 set. I can't understand the lack of bass complaints -- it's there loud and clear. Don't blame me if they're Chinese ""fake""; what can I say? I was skeptical at first until I received them. I don't believe the very expensive earphones are any better than these cheap ones. Maybe I was lucky........but then I also got ""lucky"" on a $9 set of Sony MDR EX700 headphones that I use when I really need to crank up the bass. Regardless of origin I love these earphones and would highly recommend them for anyone who loves listening to a wide range of music (keep the Sony EX700's for heavier stuff).."
2280,"I came to these headphones after coming from $180 Shure E210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par, if not better, than them.  I loved my Shure earbuds and I love these a heck of a lot more.  The sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some, it's definitely not a deal breaker.  Personally, I appreciate the little extra bass these give.  It's not overwhelming, but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others.  There are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product:1) The adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they're being removed.  Having short hair is beneficial with these headphones, but if you have long hair, simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently.  You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.  They easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price.  No, these are not too good to be true.  You won't be disappointed."
2281,"Fair sound, great price, and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportable.Will update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold up."
2282,"I am a professional cinematographer,and have owned several lens over the years.  I don't get the positive reviews, my lens is soft wide open and down a stop too, at which point I might as well use my zoom lens and not risk dust on the sensor by taking the lens off.  To me this lens is junk.  I have shot over 3000 time lapse sequences with DSLR cameras, love the Canon DSLR cameras, just plan to sell the 50mm off soon.  Some people may have received a better copy.  But when I shoot city lights from my house overlooking a city, this lens has been the worst I have ever used.  I make a living shooting beautiful images for stock footage, sometimes with quite cheap glass, so I was sad to see the results.I shoot quite a bit at night in moonlit landscapes, so I understand fast lens shot falls, but this lens was terrible.  I also only manually focus everything, I use a hoodman loupe for all shots, to check focus, I nail focus better then using auto focus on every lens I own.  So no auto focus issue, just poor glass.I don't mean to upset anyone who may like the lens, just my professional two cents."
2283,"It worked well for a few years, but it's gotten to the point now where it's loose and won't maintain a signal in both channels unless it's positioned just right.  I usually like Hosa gear.  I have several of their cables and adapters and they are a great bargain.  Everything has been solid and stood up over time except this.  It's so much cheaper than the other brands though.  I might just get a few more knowing they may not last."
2284,"Excellent price and service.  I like the volume control onin the cabel, comeswith two size input jacks.  2 Meter cabel is just fine for PC Use which I purchased it for.  Excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor again."
2285,Works fine for the computer monitor I have. Nothing special about the chord and have not had any issues with it yet.
2286,"I bought this camera before leaving for a long stay in Japan, where I did lots of backpacking, hiking, and traveling by train or hitchhiking.  I liked the light body - it was easy to carry around and didn't weigh down my bag much at all.  Naturally the camera got banged around quite a bit, and I even dropped it in its bag a few times.  However, even though it was abused enough for the filter to crack, and I had to re-align the view mirrors when I returned, the camera kept working with absolutely no problems, through all of the 600 photographs I took.The pictures quality was excellent.  I didn't have problems with graininess, and I'd guess that the reviewers used 800 film.  Automatic focus was plenty fast.  Actually, I ended up being lazy and using the automatic features most of the time, but with few exceptions, the results were about what I'd expect.  If I had to do it again, I'd get a lens with more zoom, but that's more personal preference than anything - the included lens worked fine.I strongly recommend using a non-obtrusive filter, to protect the lens from scratches and damage."
2287,These might be good for use with a tripod but without it's nothing but shake city...they are virtually useless. The optics are poor AND We got another pair much smaller and much better quality optics that make these huge ones look like junk. NOT recommended
2288,"Can't go wrong with these headphones, the price is right and the sound is very good. I'm no audiophile, and these aren't audiophile priced headphones, but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear. I would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound good."
2289,"I use this adapter to connect my laptop (Compaq Presario with Window XP) with a Garmin eTrex vista GPS.  A small problem, it only works with the MapSource software but not with Microsoft Streets & Trips.  Microsoft Streets & Trips just won't find the GPS with any communication protocol including NMEA and RTCM.  It is not a problem for me, because I purchased the MapSource software.  For poeple who wish to use Microsoft's map (mostly for free, mine come with my new pc), you have to try with some other combination."
2290,This headphones are really great! Problem is with the extension court... It doesnt work without the remote control... (I tried to replace them) If you can use just the short cable (without extension) it will be fine...They are constructed for the new HD3 20gb mp3 walkman. I have MD. My question is if the extension work with this player... Because there is no remote for the new HD3 player... It made me sad... Now I have to buy a new HD3! :)
2291,"I bought one of these and it worked fine.  About 2 years in, the switch failed and since I could not have my network down for several weeks while Netgear &#34;solved&#34; this issue, I bought another one and then wrote to Netgear for a credit of some sort, indicating that I could send the defective switch to them and that I would like compensation for the new unit I had to buy.  They (not very promptly) got back to me and pointed out that they would only repair or replace (with a reconditioned unit) the defective switch, not replace it with a new one or a refund for a purchased unit.  Remember my premise here ... if the switch goes down, you network is down.  So, while you are waiting weeks for shipping and repair/replacement, you are simply out of luck.  Too bad.Now I suggest that a warranty of this sort is pretty much useless, so in effect, you really don't have a warranty at all.  If you have a network that you can tolerate being down for weeks, you probably don't need a network.  On top of that, I don't think that a network switch should fail this quickly - this is rather routine technology that at this point in it's evolution should be rock stable.  So, comparatively short life + useless warranty = one star.  Next time, LinkSys."
2292,"This is a nice bag for the Canon S2 if you have no accessories attached to the camera.  However, if you have mounted the LAH-DC20 lens/filter adapter on your S2 or S3, then the camera will *not* fit in the bag.  Further, there is no room in the bag to store the adapter separately.  If you never use filters or accessory lenses, then you will be happy with this bag."
2293,"It's not as good as BW or Hoya, but it gets the job done well."
2294,Works but not as good as I had hoped because someone sitting in a seat net to me could still see a dim view of the pictures that I was looking at.  Might be best to help make it difficult for others to read text from the side.
2295,"I shall say that overall this camera performs well. My main complaint is that the pictures taken in low light (with or without flash) tend to have excessive noises, i.e. tiny color dots all over. However, under ample sunlight, the problem does not seem to exist. Also, I noticed that the camera does not produce as sharp pictures as my brother's Nikon digital does. It does not degrade to the extent of defectiveness, but there certainly is more to be desired."
2296,"To be honest, I had very high hopes for this Kodak All-in-One Printer. This was supposed to have been a move up from the Dell printer I had that was supposed to have been wireless but kept losing its wireless connectivity every time I turned the printer on. After a while the wireless feature on it didn't work at all and eventually it became useless to me. Their expensive ink cartridges was another huge turn off. So I decided to go with Kodak who bragged about having inexpensive ink cartridges. Yes, that was the nugget that pulled me in.With this Kodak I never had problems with the wireless feature and I never had to reset it once since setting it up.  I can press print downstairs on my laptop and go upstairs and the document would be in the tray waiting for me to pick up. Although the connectivity is flawless the ink is a joke. It runs out too quickly.  One of the things I liked about my last Dell printer (even though the ink was expensive) is that I can still use the black ink even if my color ink cartridge was completely gone.  I was able to use one cartridge without a problem. Yes, it would keep giving me notifications that the color ink needed to be replaced but it would continue to print just using the black ink. This was a plus for me because I rarely print anything in color. If I would have known that the Kodak All In One didn't have this simple feature, I SURELY would have chosen another printer instead of this one. Now I have two new black cartridges (one in the Kodak printer) and a printer that refuses to let me bypass the fact that I need to replace the color cartridge.  (If someone found a way where I can do this then let me know and I will be fair to amend my review but thus far I can't find out how to do it). In the meanwhile, I can't print anything until I order another color ink cartridge. Bomber!It's very frustrating when you have full black ink cartridges and you can't use them because your color ink cartridges are low.  This is the first printer I've owned that refuses to print in black and white.  Btw, when my printer said that the color ink cartridge needed to be replaced I had barely used it which caused it to dry out. After I leave this review I'm going to do research for another printer. I really wish all of these reviews existed when I was considering purchasing this printer because it would have saved me tons of migraines.UPDATE 12/14/12I ordered a spanking new Kodak color ink cartridge for this printer and guess what... it doesn't print after I calibrated the new cartridges.  If you are going to purchase this printer just because you think you will be saving money on the ink cartridges, don't fall for that garbage. If you're like me who only prints occasionally this is NOT THE PRINTER FOR YOU! WHY?????  By the time you do get around to printing anything your Kodak cartridges would have dried up and it would be virtually useless. At least my expensive Dell wouldn't do this! You would be spending tons of money just to keep replacing these cartridges.  Also, this stupid thing still somehow prints using some of the color ink even when your document is in black and white. Now how stupid is this? This will cause your color cartridge to go low and eventually you won't be able to print at all even if you have a full black ink cartridge.  If I knew then what I knew now, I would have avoided this printer like the plague. Who the heck designs a printer that doesn't give you the option of using either the color or the black cartridge? I plan to stay away from Kodak printers PERIOD!UPDATE 1/5/2013AGAIN STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER!After using the ""clean printer heads"" feature constantly because I couldn't get the printer to print after inserting new cartridges, the print comes out fuzzy and basically unreadable. This is so disappointing. This printer is total garbage. I'm looking for another printer. This was will be on the curb waiting for the garbage man.UPDATE 2/17/13Changed both cartridges and the printer is virtually useless.  This is very disappointing because I rarely used this and my son now has to go to his college library in order to print his papers because this printer useless to us now. I went thru the ""clean printer heads"" feature over and over. I know customer service won't help based upon every else's experience with them, so I won't bother.Those of you who just purchased this printer and say that it's a real bargain and you are pleased with it, I'll give you a year before you come back to update your review and change your 5 stars to 1 star. When you eat your way thru colored ink that you don't use (even when you're not printing anything in color, this printer uses it anyway) and find out when the color is finished you can't use the black ink by itself, and your cartridge heads fail or you have to keep purchasing color ink everytime you purchase black ink you will then wish you had gone by these reviews here.  Personally, I wish I could give this ""0"" stars because it was a huge waste of money for me. Kodak is bankrupt. Stay away from their products. Their commercials are not running on tv any longer for a reason. Buyer be VERY AWARE!This review will receive no more updates from me. I thought I could troubleshoot it some more but it's a dud! Again, buyer be VERY AWARE! Stay far away from this potential troublemaker!"
2297,This Belkin Jack Modular T Adapter was a perfect replacement to my old two-way phone jack which was already breaking apart and no longer functioning. It's perfectly compatible with my AT&T Cordless telephone and I haven't had any problems with it since I bought it two months ago. This two-way phone jack is a fine product. It's cheap and easy to install.
2298,"So I have been through two sets of these now (shame on me).  First set failed about 15 months after installation, so no warranty support.  Didn't even ask, just figured it was a fluke, and bought another set.  Second set failed before 12 months but I was not able to contact the vendor about it until it had been over 12 months.I was told no warranty when I contacted TIC.  I responded with an unhappy letter and they relented, agreeing to warranty the units if I paid shipping both ways.  This was promising, but it was still disappointing to have had two sets fail in around a year.  So I spent another $35.00 to send the speakers to them for warranty repair or replacement.  They came back and said the speakers had been in the ground for two years, and they would not honor the warranty.  No explanation of how they came to that conclusion, they just essentially accused me of being a liar, and then had the gall to offer to sell me a new set for a ""discounted price"" that's still more then they sell for here brand new.  Please...It was a disappointing and insulting experience, buyer beware.  If you look here a little bit, you will find similar speakers for a little more money, but come with a limited lifetime warranty.  I am two years and $195.00 into TIC products, and I have nothing left that works.  Unless you want to replace them every year,  I suggest you explore other options, I plan to."
2299,"I have had a variety of Sony Headphones (and others over the years - Sennheiser, Nady, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc.) including the MDR V-700, V-300, V-7506 and others.  These MDR-V900 Monitors though are the best!  I use them for monitoring music, movies, and most importantly, I use them when playing my Bass Guitar at church.  They have a great ""boot'en"" bottom-end as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproduction...they simply kick! I paid much more for them than that advertized on Amazon right now and I am considering buying other pairs for my drummer, sound technician, and guitarist for our church group.  My opinion is you can't go wrong with these babies!"
2300,I wanted a case that could store all my gear and be used to transport it by vehicle.  It will hold two pro-dslrs if you cannibalized the space below them which means that a lens will never fit in those spaces shown in the diagram.  Standard dslrs with fit easily.  It is a very good case but it would not allow me to store two pro dslrs and seven lenses and three flashes.  I just had too much gear for the case so it has been returned.  It is very well made.  I should have probably considered the super pro 12.  It does look like it would be easy to carry using the handle or the carrying strap.  Just remember that the diagram shows two cameras without grips in order to place lenses below the bodies.  The spaces are narrow so that any mounted large fast lense may crowd out other lenses.
2301,"I needed a new telephone handset cord and purchased this one based on some positive reviews.  My previous cord was knotted and twisted and got to the point where I couldn't get it detangled.Was hoping this cord might be different and not have the knotting and twisting problems most cords do.  It's definitely a well made cord, but after a few weeks I found it slowly starting to knot and twist....Comes with the territory I guess, was just hoping to get lucky and find a cord that would hold up better than most.  This is a decent cord, but I will probably end up replacing it soon."
2302,"Following suggestions made by other purchasers, I used the earphone jack rather than the audio output on the TV. Loud commercials are reduced, but some still tend to sound louder than the regular programming."
2303,"I bought this lens after going through many reviews and mainly used this with my Canon Rebel XT, this lens is very good!Though it's a macro lens, I have used this for portrait photos and it works like a charm! I have yet to test this on my new Canon t2i. I am sure this lens will give me better pictures with the new camera.I am using this camera for past one year...You can check my sample pictures.This lens is well worth the money!Cons:Don't come with a camera hood :-(Not weather sealed  (If I can afford a weather sealed camera in future :-) )"
2304,ive used everything and all tools are useful. they are a bit 'cheap' but thats exactly what i paid for the kit! handles feel like they will break if i applied to much force but theyre for working on comps so no need for the kind of force that would break them. if youre working on cars or appliances get something else but this kit is great for electronics.a flashlight (and anti-static wrist strap) would round out the kit nicely but if you have a small mag-lite type put it with the kit and youll be all set.
2305,"I bought this one thinking it was like the one my computer equipment is plugged into.  Only difference is the one I have has an input and output for telephone.  I bought it for new tv and stereo equipment in living room as I had a cheap surge protector.  I will probably use this one on bedroom tv and buy the right one next time for living room.  Want to have protection on phone jack for satellite receiver.  I like the design on these and you can plug everything into it and feel fairly certain a power surge or lightning strike won't take out all your equipment.  Their warranty (75,000) and customer service as other people have noted are the best.  Would recommend this product."
2306,I got one of these and it died within a few days. I contacted Nikon and never got a response.
2307,"While this product worked with my new custom P4 2.8 GHz and my older custom PII400, it failed miserably with a Gateway P133 and the same PII400.  The mouse was not recognized on the Gateway, the keyboard would not work with the mouse plugged into the KVM, and the monitor went black with each keystroke even after removing the mouse.  I tried several different configs, even different mice, with no success.  I took it to work where I have 2 Gateway PII400s, and it failed with them as well.  Before you blame Gateway, I went and bought an IO Gear KVM for $50, including an audio connector.  We use IO Gear 4 port box-style switches at work with great success.  The 2 port mini KVM from IO Gear worked flawlessly.  LinkSys' site doesn't even list the KVM as a product they sell.  Stay away from this one."
2308,"I don't remember how long I've owned these headphones but it has to be close to 20 years.(The only maintenance I have done is replace the foam earpads) I have treated them with care and kept them from any type of abuse. They still look almost new and still sound exceptional. More recently I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD590 phones thinking that perhaps I would get even better quality sound. Indeed, the 590's sound very good but frankly, though they sound slightly different than the v6's, I don't think they sound any better.The v6's have a presence and clarity which is very compelling. They can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlessly.The mid-tones are clear and mellow. Distortion is inaudible. If you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money I recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones."
2309,"I purchased this based upon the quality reputation of Sony products.  This item must be something that Sony is considering for discontinuation?Brief:1.) The limitations / interference to the Infra red wirless mechanism due to sunlight, lamp lights - is simply not acceptable.  It DOES create a lot of obstacles to the performance of this item!!  And you won't know until you unwrap the item and read the manual!2.) Sound is good quality ONLY if you have an unobtrusive line of direction between the head set and the base.  (Above comments)3.) I spent easily an hour or two trying to configure the base location in respect to the common place for sitting and wearing the headphones.  In the case of my parents home - this was extremely challenging!  To the point that I almost re-packed this item and returned it!I DO NOT recommend this item.  I DO recommend that the wireless system you eventually buy is a an item from reputable reference resources and that you take the time investigating.  The prior commentary / reviews relative to this product on this site were NOT helpful at all!!  I would have rather spent another $20-50.00 to have had a better product!"
2310,I use these headphones with my Avid mbox mini and since I have set everything up I have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better.  They are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint.  My wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons.
2311,Same quality as any other cd case. I needed these because when I buy blanks I get them by the spindle.
2312,"Immediately out of the box the lens was making grinding noises, It had terrible auto focus, and one month after purchase the lens housing actually FELL OUT while on a shoot. Embarrassing, Ridiculous, Unacceptable. Piece of junk..I feel like I would have gotten better quality out of a Tamron..."
2313,"I have wanted a digital camera for SO long, but never wanted to pay the high price for some of the &quot;necessities&quot;. This camera fit the bill. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was taking pictures and emailing them to grandma. Within and hour, I was taking pictures and loading auctions to help pay for my new toy! Yes, it could have come with an AC adapter,lens cover, etc. BUT, in my case, I would prefer to buy that next month. You can always add on buy buying a memory card, USB flash card reader, etc. That would make it faster, but for my purposes, as a &quot;mom&quot;, this camera really works well for me and my budget!! Oh, I might add, I did have to call Kodak for one teeny little question and they had my question answered in 30 seconds or less! So, they do back their product! If you go to their website, you can even play an interactive demo of this camera and see actual photographs!  One feature that I really love is that I am able to crop and modify pics all from one place before sending them out. No more wasting download time on boring backgrounds!!  So, if you need/want an inexpensive solution to the digital camera, this would be it. If you want all the add ons and want to pay the price now, you would go with  a more expensive camera. However, the quality of the pic is tremendous!"
2314,"The "" Cleaning Head"" will leave a light and uneven grey film on the lens. The brush is not well protected. It can trap dirt even it is retracted. Do not waste your money on it."
2315,Was a nice modem and worked very well......  then my service improved and now it doesn't work.  time to upgrade i guess.....
2316,"These are OK for the money (great Amazon price compared to BestBuy/Target), but like the JVC $9.99 earbuds or Bose $139 much better.PROs: good outside noise exclusionCONs: hardly any bass, didn't fit well in my earSome people really like these, but didn't work well for me."
2317,Not worth even 5 dollars.  Skip this product. Nothing more to say.  Just don't buy this product.  Find something else
2318,"These sound very, very good.  Most ""mini"" headphones are lacking in either lows, mids or highs.  These have all frequency ranges covered.At first I could not figure out how they were supposed to work in behind-the-neck mode.  I tried it every which way, but they were always either awkward or loose.  I couldn't believe they promoted these as behind-the-neck headphones when they were so ill-fitting.But I did some googling, and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual:  The headband pivots.  So what you do is, put the headphones on the top of your head so that it's comfortable; hold the ear pieces in place on your ears; then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingers.This way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head, except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top.  It's very comfortable and they fit securely.  (They're actually not behind-the-neck phones, they're behind-the-head phones.)This may be common knowledge, but I didn't see it in any of the reviews I read, though I did see complaints about how they don't work behind the neck."
2319,"This device has a problem maintaining a WLAN connection. Memory errors while using the wireless connection require a never-ending series of soft resets. Just when you think the need for soft resets are slowing, along comes a data-losing hard-reset.I'm entirely disappointed in the iPaq. I went into it believing it would be faster and more full-featured than my Palm. This has simply not been the case. Everything runs slower and requires more resets of the device. Even when I have the WLAN hooked to my DSL connection at home the web browsing is DOG SLOW . Really huge disappointment. I cannot think of anyone but a true techy who is in love with iPaq's and has to have the latest model who would get their money's worth out of this.There are FAR FAR FAR better PDA models that are out there. Don't let the ""promise"" of the latest Pocket PC platform fool you. The 5455 is FAR slower and less stable than other competitors. Beware.3 month updateHave started to use this device fairly heavily. Turned off the WLAN. That seems to resolve a substantial number of locking issues. Soft reset the device fairly regularly. Have found some great applications for calendar and that is what has kept me using it. Screen on this is nice as well."
2320,This was a good purchase. Did not realize what I was missing in my outdoor photographs until I started putting this filter on and taking pictures. Definitely makes a difference in every shot! Just remember to put the &#34;Tiffen&#34; logo towards the sun as you spin it...it does need to be in the right spot to work properly. But can easily be adjusted for more light as needed too.
2321,"Original headphones, left channel went dead within first two months. Company replaced them immediately. Replacement set lasted about 10 months when the plastic piece connecting the bracket to the ear piece just broke.  Exploded right off my head!  Fixed it with superglue. Two months later the exact same thing happened to the other ear piece.  Was watching a movie when they just fell off my head.  I was so mad I emailed their sales department complaining about their junk headphones.  They wanted the serial number and then requested that I send them back for a replacement.  That was four years ago. The ear pads have since flaked and disintegrated and those were replaced about three months ago.  Two nights ago, while watching a movie, they just exploded right off my head, the plastic piece connecting the ear piece to the head brace just broke.  I have finally trashed these head phones.  If you want a great set of headphones and are willing to pay $150, get the Sennheiser HD595.  Not only do they sound superior to the Bose Triports but they are made like a quality product should be."
2322,I like the features of this unit and now I can take my passport 9500i from car to car without moving the plug to.
2323,"used to feed an stereo in my backyard, connect it to the ipod and its working, it is outside so i hope the rain does not kill it. so far is ok."
2324,"what could it go wrong ? all I want is store CD and protect won't get scratch, that's all I ask for."
2325,"Although I just received this filter today and have used it very little, I would rate this average. The film itself appears to be made well enough and it fits my screen quite well, however, it is the manner in which the filter is retained to the laptop screen that I do not care for. Enclosed with the filter are 8 small self-adhesive plastic tabs/strips that are used to secure the filter to the pc. I wasn't too happy having to put stickers all over the screen frame on my laptop. Despite having 6 of these stickers in place, the filter sags significantly when you first open your pc lid (if you put any of the stickers at the top to solve this problem, you will have no way of removing the privacy filter). Granted, the sag goes away after the pc lid is all the way open but, it just feels sloppy or cheap to me."
2326,"as an ipod junkie and nascent audiophile, I wanted some new 'phones for walking around, etc. I had head good things about these little guys, and decide to jump on a pair.My Ears: PleasedEverything Else: horribly dissatisfied.The cord design is so inherently flawed that at first I physically couldnt believe it. the short left side terminates about 4 inches from the ear in a rather weighty splitter, and the right is designed to run along the back of your neck over to the other ear. This design, while annoying to me, seems to work marginally well, except for the weighty splitter cover which has a tendency to bounce while walking and places all of the hanging pressure on the left ear.The real problem lies in the length and quality of the cord. The first section is a horribly awkward length. I assume it's designed for those wearing the music player on their arm (um, IEMs are a bad idea for working out anyway, with the sweat). It is about 18 inches, about 8 inches too short for listening with a music player in your pocket. This forces one to use the included extension cord, which provides another meter of length. This makes the cord far too long, but the real rub is having the connector right in the middle of your abdomen. It bounces ridiculously while walking, and overall looks silly.Also, though I have yet to experience it myself, there are volumes written on the poor qulity of the cord. Read below for that.The sound is as described, however. Meaty on the lower frequencies with suprising separation for a phone at this price level. This is far overshadowed, however, by the horrible ergonomics. Mine are going right back. Avoid"
2327,"I purchased this hoping to be able to record shows from DirecTV either when I was not home or when watching another show.  The instruction booklet barely addressed connecting to a satellite (there are only several million of us using them). It is one of the most poorly written manuals I've ever seen. When I figured out how to get it connected and be able to record a show I was watching at the time, the picture quality was mediocre.  I really wanted to use it for recording when I was watching something else.  When I called Panasonic support (a number I found online, it's not in the poorly written manual), the recording warned me of hold times of 18 minutes.  It ended up being over an hour.  The rep that helped me explained that the system isn't really designed to work the way I wanted.  It's being returned.  What a disappointment, I guess I'll be going to a Tivo. I WILL NEVER BUY PANASONIC AGAIN.  This is why I usually but Sony."
2328,"I used ATP3 for 2 years.  Adquate volume, fair sound for this price range, nothing to complaint.Your desk is the key for your sound performance.  Mid range drivers are located beneath the speaker stands.  Music reflects from your desk.  Sound quality mainly depends on the desk material.  Best performance achieved when you put them on hard wooden surfaces.  Avoid metal desks.Put the sub-woofer near a corner or under your desk.  This is very important.  Sound quality will improve lots."
2329,I purchased this as an addition for my d40 equipment.  I returned it the next day.  The price should have been a tip off.  It hunted in low light about 80% of the time and 20% in good light.  It miss focused badly in more than have the 50 test exposures I took.  The build quality is definitely Canon's low end; feeling very plastic.  It was also surprisingly noisy for such a small lens.  I'll stick with the higher end Canon lenses like the 24-105L (which I love!)
2330,"I bought this adapter so that I could use an older PS2 keyboard with a Dell Inspiron notebook that only has USB slots. I plugged it in, and the keyboard worked for a few hours. But then I started to have problems. Sometimes all of the keyboard lights flash (caps lock, num lock, etc), and the keyboard stops responding. Or else it will suddenly turn on the caps lock, or it acts as though the shift keys are being held down. I also found some odd behavior with my web browser while I had it plugged in. I unplugged the adapter and the problem went away. I have gone through this same cycle 3 times now. So although most people seem to have had success with this device, it didn't work for me."
2331,"When I got my new computer, I was not at all happy with the USB keyboard that came with it.  It was subtly just a little too wide, and I was making typos at a much higher rate than usual.  The ""feel"" of it was cheap too.  Anyway, I wanted to use the keyboard from the computer I was replacing, but it was a PS2 connector which my new computer would not take.  After a bit of searching on Amazon, I thought this adapter looked like just the ticket, and bought two.Initially all was well -- plugging the PS2 connector into the adapter and then the adapter into a USB port let the OS (I use FreeBSD) see the keyboard with no apparant problem.  It was only after a few days use that I realized I hadn't just gotten clumsy, but that every now and then, keys were auto-repeating at high rates.  As I use some programs which are keyboard driven rather than mouse driven, this caused me some problems.Both adapters have this problem.  It's a shame because it works well otherwise, but I'm going to have to try another model/brand."
2332,"We have ""distinctive ring"" service on our phone line: the line has a second number associated with it; when that number is dialed the phone rings but with a distinctive ""short-short"" burst rather than the normal ring. This device allows us to use this second number as a dedicated fax number. It senses the distinctive ring and routes the call to a fax machine (or, in our case, to a desktop computer that also receives faxes).  When the phone rings normally, the call is not rerouted--we can pick it up or our answer machine will if we don't.  We have found the device very reliable over a month's use; once set up, you can forget it, it just works. I'm not sure how. It is connected to one of three extension jacks for this number; the answer machine and another phone are on a second line, but this is no problem.It has one important limitation: the only distinctive ring it can sense is the ""short-short""--our phone company also offered other options. If you chose another option, you have to revise that choice to the short-short ring for this device to work. The device also requires programming to align it with your setup.  It comes configured for a setup in which there is no distinctive ring service. In that case, the device apparently senses whether the incoming call is from a fax machine or is a voice call, and responds appropriately.  I have no experience with that function. To set it up for my situation, I had to call the support line, as I was not successful using the instructions that came with it. But the support line worked ok, there was very little wait, and i got someone who was able to help with little difficulty.  A more convenient programming set up is all the device needs for a five star rating, in my estimation."
2333,"Hooking up my laptop to my HDTV with these VGA cables, there was a little bit of ghosting. It wasn't as bad as I've seen with other comparable cables, but it wasn't the best either. Considering the cost, it's about average."
2334,"This part goes in your telescope in place of your eyepiece. It attaches to the T-ring (purchased separately) so you can fit your camera on to your telescope to begin taking pictures of the night sky! I found this piece good, but its very short, I wish it had further adjustment, other than just what the telescope provides, in order to really get your images at the correct focal point. I had difficulty getting the moon in focus using this with the Celestron T-ring for my Nikon D60 mounted on a Celestron PowerSeeker 114EQ. Other than that, its a good starting point for beginning with astrophotography."
2335,"Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.I love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!"
2336,Hace had this for a couple of years now.  It is ok and does its job.  Often goes to the setup screen which is apain to get out of when you want to watch a DVD.  Buy if cheap enough but look around as this unit is nothing special.
2337,"If I had written this review last month I might have given it three stars. Right now it's worth one star (the lowest rating) so I compromised at two stars. I use this router to be able two use two devices simultaneously with my cable modem. I never got more than two devices to work simultaneously with this router. The two devices now are my desktop PC in my den and my internet radio in my bedroom, which I listen to every night with headphones. Both devices are hard wired with cat 5 cable. I didn't want to use wireless because I wanted the best speeds.  If I could have gotten a third device to work with this router it would have been my laptop in my den for when my wife and I both wanted to use a computer at the same time.The router worked OK with just my desktop and the internet radio for about three years, even though it slowed my internet throughput on the PC by about 20%, even when the radio was turned off. It basically saved me the trouble of unplugging my PC from my cable modem and plugging my radio in before going to bed at night.For the last month or so I noticed intermittent drop out of my internet connection. The dropouts only happened when using the router, not when plugged directly into the modem. I tried a different cat5 cable from the router to the modem, and resetting the router but it didn't help. For the last two days the drop outs have been happening several times an hour, on both my PC and on my radio, so the router is now unusable. This router always ran hot so I raised it off the desk to give it some ventilation, but I think it basically fried itself in three years.So if you want a mediocre 4 port router that only works for two devices that burns out in three years, this one is for you."
2338,"These pads are used to help stabilize your telescope tripod mount (one pad goes under each tripod leg) you wont see much improvement with these when using high power eyepieces and though they do seem to help a bit, when using a higher power eyepiece (9mm or better) just touching the scope will cause it to shake. These do help if you are using a camera to take pictures or video of what you are viewing."
2339,The standard FM/AM reception is decent on this radio and it's size is convenient but I have yet to find a weather station on it.  Maybe it's just me.  I'm going to try another brand.
2340,Found out that it is 10 years old.  Driver install was painful.  But eventually I screwed around with enough things it started to work.  Not even worth $12.
2341,8910 doesn't work with Direct TV with Tivo you need a upgrade. Works very well else wise.
2342,"These Koss headphones are such a great buy. Less than $20 and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too. These, of course, do not have audiophile quality,  but for the everyday Joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the ticket. ;)"
2343,"I'm using this cable to extend my headphone cable to the TV when I don't want to disturb my wife with the noise.  I can't hear any difference when adding the length, but my TV doesn't exactly have a very good headphone amp to begin with.  I would prefer gold contacts, but the price was right.  I'm satisfied."
2344,"On each of the pockets there is some black webbing that's part of the plastic. What this does is almost completely block the memory card in the pocket. In other words, you can't see which card is in the pocket. Actually you sometimes can't even tell if there's something in the pocket if you glance quickly. And I need quick access sometimes, not fishing into each pocket, then looking at each card until I find the right one. Yeah I know there are flaps that you can flip, but those are kind of gimmicky, and sometimes a pain to flip up.Also, the way this S.A.S. device attaches to a Tamrac strap leaves a lot to be desired. The hook on the Tamrac straps are small, and the loops on this wallet are huge! So it just flops around in the wind. Well, not the wind, but you get the idea; it's a loose fit. It's almost like the Tamrac engineers think that photographers only stand straight up, don't walk or climb, and never set their bags down.Battery storage does seem to work okay though.A sidenote, there is a pocket the length of the wallet behind the right side. So you can put little things in here, like maybe a card-reader. Keep in mind it is deep, and for little things, like maybe a remote, they are a bit harder to get out.I definitely see some room for improvement on this device, but unfortunately it's not likely Tamrac will make any changes.An easy fix for the hiding cards I complained about would be just to change the background material to a different, bright color. Like yellow."
2345,"This camera is very similar in features to the Minolta STSI, in about the same price range, but I was still impressed enough with it to make a few comments. One thing the STSI offers that the Canon doesn't is predictive autofocus. This can be quite useful when doing action shots. It also offers a panorama mode, which the Canon doesn't offer. I've enjoyed using this mode quite a bit on my little Fuji Tiara APS camera. Both cameras have similar F ratios for the lens and both have 1/2000th of a sec top shutter speeds. Two things the Canon offers that are nice are the 7 selectable autofocus points, which some advanced users might find useful, and depth-of-field preview. Even the Elan II doesn't offer the latter capability. One last thing to be aware of is that the Minolta camera will usually be offered with a 3rd party lens. If you want a Minolta lens you'll need to pay quite a bit more for it. However, the Canon comes with a Canon lens but doesn't cost any more. All in all, this is a pretty feature-packed camera at an attractive price, which should serve the needs of the vast majority of photo buffs."
2346,"I bought these headphones on Amazon for the great price of 50 bucks and let me tell you it was money well spent.  They sound fantastic and feel very comfortable after watching 2 hour long movies or listening to long music sessions while working around the house.Keep in mind, like most headphones, they require time to &#34;burn in.&#34; Out of the box the highs sounded off and bass was mediocre. After a week of listening the headphones sound fantastic and keep getting better. Remember this when purchasing these headphones. If you can get them for the 50 bucks I got them, then I promise you will enjoy the sound and the price!"
2347,"Using my NIKKOR 18-140mm lens on a D7000, I get great picture quality, but I fully expect the filter to fall off at some point. as the fit isn't very snug. That being said, it's a $20 filter and the Nikon one is $120, so I can't expect that much."
2348,"I bought the D-link wireless router to go with my home office net and it workd well except for a mechanical, not computer, problem. I hooked everything up to directions and when it became necessary to plug the Cat5 cable into the router it wouldn't fit! The cable keeps popping out of the jack. Thinking it was just a bad cable, I tried 5 others and got the same results. After calling support, I was given an RMA and they shipped out another unit. Happily I hooked it up, but I had the same problem. I called support again and have another RMA.I also happened to see a tech in a large, well-known outlet store, who said he uses D-link routers and has never had a problem. He asked me to bring it in for a free inspection and that's just where I'm heading today.I'm using it with 2 desktop pc's and an Axim 5 with a CF card WiFi adaptor and it works well when the cable stays put. I get a message on my desktop that a network cable is unplugged, then another that says cable is reconnected.Try before you buy!"
2349,"I bought the Sony MDR-V600 headphones about 3 seasons ago, and have loved them ever since. I bought them refurbished from Amazon.com at the time, and paid $70 for them (including shipping). Mind you, those were used, refurbished headphones, but they and their packaging looked like new and performed (and still perform) like new. I am baffled to see them being sold for $200 on Amazon now, even though their traditionally more expensive and higher quality siblings (the MDR-V6 and MDR7506) are offered for $130 and $100 less, respectively. If you were planning to spend the stated $200 on the Sony MDR-V600 headphones, do yourself a favor and try the MDR-V6 or MDR7506 instead.With that said, I love my V600s and have never regretted the purchase. The bass is subtle but still obviously present, while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my MacBook Pro (2012 model, which has a good on-board DAC in it). This is reflected in the advertised frequency range of 5-30,000 Hz, and it surprised me since in my experience, Sony headphones traditionally sound a bit heavy on the bass, and muffled. In comparison, these headphones produce super clear sound.Best of all, the V600s are *comfortable*! So much so that I can wear them for hours on end during study sessions and never get tired of wearing them. They work well with my old iPod Video (generation 5.5, 30GB) and different computers, which means the headphones don't use a lot of power.Verdict: if you can find these headphones for $60-70, it is a deal you should never pass up. I thought they sounded better and more accurate than a friend's AKG 702 (which was admittedly more comfortable and durable, but still). Those looking to spend $200 on headphones and are interested in the MDR-V600 should save themselves $100 and get the higher-quality V6 or MDR7506 instead."
2350,"I got a Panasonic KX-TCA60 and this Plantronics M175C.  The Plantronics M175C is definitely better.  It is more comfortable, and the microphone is more sensitive and has better sound quality.Scott"
2351,The connections aren't the best - you have to jiggle them a bit sometimes to get the sound to come through on both channels.
2352,"The reception is poor.  That is, if you can even get a station tuned in.  Sony has a model with push button stations, and  better reception."
2353,Can't get my new laptop to recognize a serial transcription pedal plugged into the USB via the Belkin because there is no Windows 7 driver. It's not mentioned on the CD that came with the cable. Nor is there a Windows 7 driver available on the Belkin site. Works fine on an old XP machine but that's not the one I bought the cable for since that pc also has serial. Windows 7 has been out a while so I wonder if Belkin even plans on creating drivers for that OS for its existing cables.
2354,These do work but are a bit thick so don't work well with my phone case/s so I have to use a cord extension to make it work. It took a long time for this to send and did not get here in the ETA window. All in all I will be using these but my advice is pick some up at Wal-mart or a Convenient Mart.
2355,"I love these headphones, as well as the MDR-V600 headphones.  I believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin.  However, since hygiene is of utmost importance, especially if more than one person is using the headphones, I have purchased some sanitary headphone covers.  This not only keeps the headphones clean, it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever.  Just an idea, but try using sanitary headphone covers on ALL your headphones.  I believe you can buy a bag of 100 on-line for about $18.00.  It's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones.  I use them in my home studio, and the frequency response is excellent, and I can hear every note, not to mention the exceptional large drivers (50-mm) that the headphones contain."
2356,"The best sounding junk phones ever made that will last less than 30 day and short out.I have spend over 200.00 this year for headphones but these are perfect for great sound and far better than I expected for sound only. I think you'll need to spend 100.00 bucks to get better.These are cheap top trash.I called to warrantee and the guy said this was a joke number given on the package, I dialed the number again and he got angry. This is not a real deal just a fake number. I just sent them back for a replacement and I will get another 3 weeks phone and then return them for a refund when they short out.Do not buy these if you plan to need them to work for mopre than 3 weeks."
2357,"Stay away from Memorex CD-R's.  They burn fine but will not play on many cd changers, Sony for one.  If you have Pioneer changers, they will work but I'd be leery all the same."
2358,"These switches are unstable.  Wiggle a wire, and half of the switch will crash.  May work fine for months at a time, then partially crash...  When crashed some ports still work, while other's don't.Not worth the trouble."
2359,"Again, got this for any repairs I needed to do (PC wise) for family members.  Got the same kit at work and it's great."
2360,"Some of the people at the local camera shop don't have a high opinion of Tiffen.  However, I have used this lens for hundreds of photographs along with my expensive B+H and see no difference.  Unless you're a professional or plan on making large posters, I bet you won't see any difference, either."
2361,This media gives me trouble burning on one of my CD drives that has never had problems with any other media.  Sony will not support them because I am not using a Sony CD drive and blames it on my drive that has never had trouble burning any other disks.  After this experience I am going to avoid buying any Sony product again.
2362,I've owned two pair of these headphones over the years.  This pair was a gift for my grandson.  There was a problem with them when I received them.  The insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones.  I returned them and Amazon immediately replaced them.  If I ever need another pair this is what I'll buy again.
2363,"Got one to give the wife some more photo options when shooting self portraits of family as well as scenery when she's getting her photographer on. Unfortunately this thing doesnt work as advertised, but for $3 I'm not concerned with the return, as I would spend more in shipping than I would for getting a refund."
2364,"It's hard to believe that's its 2007 and they would make router software without support for MAC.  Also, there is no download, the software runs from the CD, which means you have to load the CD when you want to inquire, run help, etc.They also charge for customer service after three months!!!  The cost is $69!  Almost twice the cost of the router.  I owned a Linksys before buying this router and have nothing but praise for Linksys hardware and support."
2365,"Belkin usually has a good product, and this one is despite my 3 stars. My complaint is that with the size of electric plugs I can only get 3 of them on this 6-plug surge protector. I mostly got it for the on/off switch."
2366,had two of these and they seem to break or altogether stop working after about 5 to 6 days .
2367,Keep in mind that this is 25 feet long if you pull on the cord enough to stretch it out that far.  But then the phone starts to come your way.
2368,Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band with Adjustable Grounding  - this is great for installing memory into my laptops .. Great for anti-static protection.
2369,"I like this focal length in a macro, and I like the aperture.  I wish the L series macro were not 180mm, because I want a shorter macro. But Canon, those cads, don't make a short Macro in a L Series lens. So I had to buy some plastic. Oh well. It's fine, I guess. But not as sensual as my silky smooth L lenses. As a matter of fact, I am kind of embarrassed by it's lack of a red ring, and plasticky-ness. But it works ok, and someday, I pray Canon will make me a nice L Series, honest to god METAL macro in a shorter focal length.  Like 65mm, and f2.5, OK Canon gods?"
2370,"I never wind up with a complete recording of my input, thus I bought a digital recorder, which at this moment I cannot find.  I liked this in the early beginnings, but operating it in the night time is very difficult, because the action keys are not clearly visible."
2371,"I was unable to sync them up and try them out.  My package contained two receivers.  They are not marked, the way to tell is the receivers have one phone jack, the transmitter has two."
2372,"Not a bad little tool kit for the $$$. The picture is out of date, however there is NO SOLDER INCLUDED anymore. I suspect this is due to some tree-hugging, lead warning nonsense. Like some of the other reviewers have stated, the penlight included looks like a toy from the '60's and should be replaced by a Mini-Mag or other quality penlight (I swapped-in an LED penlight). If you're creative, you can cram a few extra tools in the case. I was even able to fit a small ""shirt-pocket"" style multimeter in the case."
2373,"I've skimmed through other reviews here, checking to see if the problems i've been having with mine were common, and if there was a workaround that someone had noted.Alas, this is not to be.Summary:1. The battery life sucks. Really. Sucks.2. Connection problems ALL over the map. I'm in the middle of using the bloody mouse after putting in new batteries and it ceases to move. just dies, no reason, no form, and the workaround for this is to remove the device and readd it. For $150, I think not.3. Authentication failures. I get them all the time. Often, the only way to solve my problems is to plug in a corded keyboard and mouse - and if i'm going to do that 100 times, I suppose I should dump the product.If I could give this product a negative number for stars, I would. It's horrible, it's a beast on battery life, it's certainly not for new comers to computers and windows and bluetooth, it's bluetooth adapter certainly doesn't work with most devices (none thatI have) and to boot, it messes with my bluetooth adapter that I had to buy to solve that first problem! I like the idea of secure wireless connections, but surely Microsoft can do better than this.Too bad I can't sue for damages and the waste of hours of my life."
2374,Hacked off one end to solder on RCA connector to convert from (Behringer) balanced outputs to unbalanced inputs.  This cable is moderate quality and might cause cross-talk between stereo channels..
2375,Have a case on your iPhone or iPad?  Forget about this adapter.  It failed to properly seat with an Apple Smart Case.
2376,"For studio monitoring, you can't go wrong with these. The Sennheiser HD 280 pro, are a heftier, build, have a flatter response, and all parts are replaceable, but it's good to have more than one tool in this area. This being my second pair of Sony MDR-V6, my son destroyed my original pair in an electronic music class, after he ""borrowed"" them, I found sonically, I was missing something by just using the Sennhiesers. The Sony's have deeper bass and an extended high end, which makes them more ""musical"". The quality for the price can not be beat. In fact for listening to music, I would recommend these, over any other headphone under $100.00. You have to trust so many positive reviews, these are classics!Addendum 12/4/2011I added the Beyer Dynamic Padded ear cushions, and these headphones are a lot more comfortable. I noticed immediately, that the bass response went way up, maybe not such a good thing for critical monitoring and mixing. I'm just wondering why? I did notice when I took the original Sony pads off, there is an additional layer, albeit thin, of foam, behind the velour. Perhaps this is why. Also as often discussed, headphones get a sweeter sound after about a 60 to 90 hour ""break in"" period. The Sony's definitely get smoother with age."
2377,"I bought this b/c my DSL modem came with a dinky, 6' cable.  Not enough!  This one is great, I would have given it four stars if it would have come in lengths longer than 25'. like 30, or 50'."
2378,"It has served me well since year 2005 to 2006. However the hex ring is of poor construction. Actually the wrench set survives to be of use today, But honestly no one changes chips on their motherboards now so it's quite an outdated set"
2379,Installed the driver but could not get it to work under Windows 7.  I tried to open the port with Putty but would not open.  Windows shows the driver is installed and device is running correctly but could not get it to talk to the serial device..
2380,"I've had this player a couple of months and I have to say I am not all that impressed.  I use it primarily for jogging and it definitely is not designed for that purpose.  The buttons on the side are extreemly tiny and not easy to identify with a quick feel.  The carrying case is so tight that it actually depresses the volume buttons - I had to actually cut out part of the plastic so that would stop happening.  The overall user interface isn't memorable either.That said, the size is perfectly tiny and the expandability is something that most players this size don't offer.  I'd be happy with this one if I used it for day-to-day activities that don't involve exercise."
2381,"I bought this kit to replace my old Dollar Tree mini screw driver kit that finally broke. I used it to disassemble my HP laptop to clean it out with an air duster. The tools in this kit are very durable and the case it comes with is nice too. So far, I've used the small Phillips, tweezers, and screw removal/inserter tool. Both are very useful to have and made my job a lot easier.The only downside is that this is missing a plastic pry tool. I know that those are mainly used for taking about phones and MP3 players, but some laptops need them as well. I used an old plastic gift card to pry it open, but a pry tool would have been much more convenient and efficient. The lack of a pry tool is the only reason I do not give this kit 5 stars. Besides this, the kit is a great starter kit for someone who is new to working with computers."
2382,"We have two Nikon Coolpixs 3100's in the family - both with serious problems. On the plus side, the camera takes good pictures when it works.One has the lens mechanism failure (System Error shows, lens won't retract) and is unusable. The second was dropped, and the catch on the battery door broke. Unfortunately, the catch is part of the body, and so it's uneconomic to service. It's still usable on a tripd! I still use a 40 year old Nikkormat, but these cameras are built to a poor standard."
2383,"The first time I bought these was about 6 years ago. They are still working just like new, without any distortion. Comfort of these is amazing. Few days ago I have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement. The best headphones for the price!"
2384,"Bought this for my canon,  seems to be of good quality and it was reasonably priced.  Arrived quickly and in good condition."
2385,"The heart of any camera is in the lens, and the Zeiss lens on the Sony DSC-F505V is one of the best, if not *the* best, lens I've seen on a fixed-lens digital camera. Add to that the high resolution and Sony's novel pixel interpolation software, and you've got a camera that will produce absolutely striking 8x10s- prints so good that you'll find it hard to believe they weren't made from film. Add to that the manula override and incredible cool looks of this camera and you've got a winning package- almost.Unfortunately Sony decided to equip this otherwise outstanding camera with their own proprietary memory stick storage format. These sticks cost anywhere from 20-50% more than SmartCards and are only available from Sony. And with the resolution this camera produces you'll need at least one 64 meg memory stick- more if you plan on extended outings. The ergonomics aren't great, either. This is not an easy camera to use with two hands and work the controls as well. It almost looks as if ergonomics were sacrificed for style.Hence only 4 stars. If Sony had used a more standard high-density storage format nd made it a little easier to handle they'd have a 5-star product."
2386,this radio should be a good one cobra usually is but this radio did not work when I received it I will have to keep looking.as soon as I get a credit for return I will buy another I think uniden this time I will see if it will work!
2387,"I decided to get the AudioSource EQ 10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer in spite of the many reviews expressing dislikes from unhappy customers. I wanted one, especially after my old Technics graphic equalizer had given up the ghost!The sound was ok, but it just wasn't sounding like it did before the old equalizer died!With this new unit, it helps give the sound coming from your headphones and speakers that extra kick which also give a tremendous boost to the bass & highs!! The dazzling Spectrum Analyzer Display give the appearance of dancing Christmas lights!  You can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of music!My old Technics unit was good, but it didn't have the display. Just the buttons that light up in red. There are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power, Tape 2 & 2, Audio/Video, EQ Bypass, EQ Record and Line/Tape. Two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left & right channels.When the unit is turned on, the power button lights up in green. In the off position, it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back on.Getting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course! At first there was no audio for about 3 or 4 tries. Then I thought about sending it back until I hooked up the audio cables, and then, the audio worked perfectly!!All in all, I think that it's a great addition to anyone's stereo system!! I just hope that no problems develop with it.~Daquan13."
2388,"Well constructed. Has a quality feel. Made in USA.It polarizes the light coming through your lens--twist the two-piece filter ring to see the variation.It's not easy to operate with a lens hood on. I reach into the hood to twist the filter ring, but that blocks part of the viewfinder while I'm doing it. Not a huge problem."
2389,"cheap and OK. just a plastic case, what can it go wrong ? it store CD and protect it without get scratch."
2390,"I paid like $70 for these. I should have bought a few but I didn't know they price would jump so high. I paid less than half of what they are currently going for on Amazon. They just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation CDs require. So, I bought them for that purpose. They do a great job and they're also high quality headphones. What more could I ask for?"
2391,I can't remember if I posted a review for this back in January or not. Now it is December. I mostly used it for video games when family went to bed. It wasn't exceptional and only sat 10 feet away. It would crackle during quiet times and range was garbage but it did okay. I recently used it for the first time with a movie and it was terrible. The hiss was constant and the audio was just bad. I feel the quality has also degraded some what with video games too. I am considering another newer sony headset but only because sennheiser's are so expensive.
2392,"On the plus side: The sound quality is satisfactory for the price provided the buds are actually in the ear canal.On the down side: The biggest problem is they do not remain snug in my ear canal.  Instead I have to push them into the ear canal where the sound can be best heard. But as soon as I start any kind of movement, household chores, work outside, or exercise, the buds fall out of the ear canal. So you can either push them back every few seconds or turn the volume on your player up - which will give you tinny high frequency sound only. They may work if you have a larger ear canal, the size of say the Chunnel or the Big Dig. The ear loops are of lightweight plastic and not adjustable at all.  So there is no way to achieve a snug fit whereby the buds remain in place. There is no sound isolation whatsoever so they are no good for a plane or any environment with ambient noise. I've revised this review so I can add that I have found them to be unusable for any task except listening while sitting totally still."
2393,"FYI tried to use this product as a USB 2.0 port for a Mac Powerbook G4 running Leopard (10.5).  The card worked fine for keyboards, mice, and ipod syncing, but it did not work for iPhone syncing.  It would frequently cause kernel panics and require manual powercycling to reboot the mac.I tried a few different ways to get it to work (including using the drivers built-in to Leopard and then using the latest 2003 drivers from the iogear website), but ultimately was forced to give up.Note that I also tried a Belkin product and was similarly unsuccessful."
2394,"If you want to jump into macro photography without making your banker angry and making compromise in image quality, this lens is the perfect choice, here is why:- Almost half the price of the IS version (and even more if you get a nice used one).- Very good image quality, L rated.- Nice build quality.- A joy to use the very large focusing ring.- Pretty good for portrait too.A couple of things:- Don't think about doing macro photography without flash! I'm personally using a 580EX II + pocketwizard.- Prefer close-up lens (like the Canon 250D) than extension tubes, because they are much more easier to use (no need to get the lens out of the body) and you don't loose any light.If you need real world samples, just check my website and blog:[...][...]Emmanuel."
2395,"The privacy filter itself works great.  It does affect the sharpness of the display, but that's a small price to pay for privacy.  My complaint is with the tabs that keep it attached to the screen.  I wish they were different so taking the screen on and off as needed was easier.  The tabs are really it's only downfall."
2396,"I used to swear by Netgear during my years of corporate IT servitude, but it seems that they've really abandoned any quality goals when it comes to their consumer grade equipment.  This is the third (and last) piece of almost brand new Netgear equipment that is sitting in my parts closet unused.Every couple of hours it will disconnect all the users/devices attached to it.  This disconnect would last anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute or more.  Definitely puts a kink in large file transfers, video streaming and online gaming.I got a D-Link gigabit switch to replace it and couldn't be happier.D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop SwitchI must admit I prefer the build and look of the Netgear (it's solid and the rear facing LEDs are great) as opposed to the D-Link's plasticky lightness, but it's all about performance, not looks now, isn't it?"
2397,I bought this so I could get to the printer's settings and set up the WiFi. It turned out I didn't really need it because the WPS feature worked perfectly. (Brother HL-2270DW Compact Laser Printer with Wireless Networking and Duplex)I would buy another another of these cables if I needed one.
2398,The headband (it is adjustable) cracked and one of the volume controls became noisy. The sound is good and it's very comfortable.
2399,"I just needed a short cable for streaming video.  It's a good heavy duty cable, and works just fine.  No dropping of frames that I've experienced.  However, I recently found [...] for all cables.  Bought a bunch of really nice cables (4) for under [...].  Very highly rated by nearly all buyers.  Check it out!!"
2400,"I have a little mixer and my only complaint about this wire is, it's two short. I can't do anything, I use it only when I have my laptop next to it."
2401,"The Canon Rebel EOS 2000 is really one of the best buys in 35mm film cameras. The autofocus 28-80 lens works for all but the longest shots, and telephoto lenses are readily available. It's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price. It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range. This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also), but with more features and even easier to use. A lot of &quot;Bang For The Buck&quot;!"
2402,"We're Linksys lovers...if Linksys makes it we have it.  We bought some of these to give our IP phones some freedom.  My guys carry actual phone system IP phones on the road so we can have a full on office wherever they are.  These didn't work good, the little Linksys black box without external antenna works great.  Go for that one."
2403,"This router was very easy to setup.  Its web-based interface was easy to understand, although you need to tweak the MAC address you send upstream if you are connected to a cable modem.  From a feature perspective, this router provides all of the essential wireless ones---a built-in firewall, MAC address filtering (which allows you to choose specific computers that are allowed to connect), SSID broadcast enable/disable (an invisible Wi-Fi network is more secure), and decent access logs.When using WEP encryption (which is outdated), this router performs fairly well.Also, the 4 LAN ports work reliably and well.However, when I downloaded the WPA firmware upgrade, my router changed significantly.  WPA connections are much slower, due to the encryption.  More importantly, WPA connections have a tendency to freeze the router, requiring you to push the reset button in the back (unplugging the router won't work).To be fair, I have the older v1 of this router (there are at least 6 versions of this router, newer versions are labeled WGR614v2, WGR614v3 and so on), for which the only firmware update is labeled as beta.  Nonetheless, this renders the wireless router useless to me."
2404,"I found that they don't meet my wants, act like a usb, they have to prepare to unload the device, what happened to the drawer oppening"
2405,"I love this product because of the ability to switch from speakers to headset without plugging cords in and out.Pros:  No plugging and unpluggingCons:  No upgrade-ability to 5.1 audio.  The build quality is cheap.  Sure, it's just a switch in there, but that means the footprint could be less with higher quality plastics, rubber feet (to prevent it from sliding around)."
2406,"This headset works great! I've been using it for several weeks now and the sound is clear and the fit is comfortable. I spend several hours a day on the phone, so comfort was a biggie for me."
2407,"If you are planning to use this to target USB Generic text devices (like CHIT printers/etc.) then do not waste your time and effort on this print server; installation routines are not easily adapted, server level support for sharing a printer on this device are hit and miss, and it's handling of non-standard (GENERIC/TXT) printers is very poor."
2408,"I have bought many headphones and found that these sound more professional than my most expensive headphones. These cans are legendary in the audio world. With a flat frequency response, they are very EQ friendly. These headphones will definitely tell you the quality of your music so it is best to have your MP3's with the highest bitrate possible, or use FLAC whenever you can. I have read that some people are disappointed with the sound, it is not the headphones!!! It is your music source and the equipment used. It is best that you have some kind of headphone amplifier or good audio gear to drive them as ipods and the like do not have the power to properly push them.These are my go to headphones when I want to have a good listening experience.As a last note, Sony has quietly retired the MDR-V6's after nearly 30 years of service!!!! I ordered an extra pair just in case and I also have the MDR-7506 as well but prefer the old tried and true MDR-V6.Get them while you can and beware of knock-offs!!!"

2410,"This D-Link 7 port hub works fine for peripherals like external hard drives, your phone, etc... It seems to have quite a lot of power. Tested with two portable HDDs (usb powered), iPhone5, and Amazon Kindle. Everything worked simultaneously.THE HUB DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH KEYBOARD + MOUSE ON MY MACBOOK.I can not wake the computer using my keyboard and mouse when plugged in through the hub. The devices take about 20 seconds to start working after the computer is awoken (using the built-in laptop keyboard).My solution is to plug the keyboard directly into the laptop, and my mouse into the keyboard. But this solution may not work for everybody.In all, the hub functions as I need it to. But BEWARE of this limitation on Mac computers. There are many forum posts about this if you google &#34;D-Link Mac Wake From Sleep&#34;"
2411,"The Motorola Signal Booster is very easy to install, once you get the right configuration (see below).  It's very well made with high quality components... at least those that you can see.  The problem with this type of device is that it's difficult to evaluate its performance.  I installed it on a TV connected to a digital cable service (Comcast), downstream from a signal splitter.  The picture was digitizing on some channels making it unpleasant to watch (just on those channels).  The Motorola seems to have helped the situation, but I still get some pixelation only less often.  It's my opinion that the signal booster has helped, but I can't tell to what degree.Also, do not install this device in-line before a router.  I did this first, because I wanted to boost my Internet performance as well as the TV.  It overwhelmed the router causing it to stop working.  I was able to straighten it out after talking with support at Comcast, the modem manufacturer, and the router manufacturer, but it took a while.  I would have preferred to have skipped this whole episode, and would have, if the instructions had simply told me not to install it in that configuration.In general, Motorola manufactures good products.  I accept that this signal booster is doing what it's supposed to do.  It's just hard to tell if it is or not."
2412,"I chose to buy the NetGear router because it was about $10 cheaper than LinkSys, plus it got a great review from CNET. I was disappointed with the router, though. The connection drops to a really low speed all the time, and the farthest I've ever used it is about 30 feet with two walls of separation.Also, when my friend came over with his laptop, he was unable to even connect to my network because he uses .11b instead of .11g. Be warned, if you plan on using b and g simultaneously, this router is definitely not for you.In conclusion, I would recommend paying more for the brand that more people trust: LinkSys.Happy hunting!"
2413,"Junk, absolute junk.  Don't even try to complain to Creative.  Talk about a bunch of losers.  If you have a soundblaster already installed, you might as well reformat to get the new one to work.  I am a computer engineer for crying out loud.  The soundblaster uninstall does not work, and you can spend forever trying to track down all the files that need to be deleted so that your new card will install correctly, but you will never find them all."
2414,I called Tech Service and after holding for five or ten minutes I got a rep. and was told they would need tocall me back. I never got a call back.I returned the router.
2415,The description was incorrect and did not fit my camera. It wasn't worth sending back so maybe I can give it away to someone.
2416,"It's a network cable, it does what it is supposed to do. The price was very reasonable. The color is nice."
2417,"Genuine APC Replacement Battery, which is what I was looking for.  I have purchased third party replacement battery and they don't last more than a year.This works well so far for 1 month.  I will wait and see if it last beyond 1 year."
2418,"So when I read the other reviews and the product description I thought this would be the adaptor for me, as I own a mono output dynamic microphone but I wanted to change that to stereo for my iMac. This works and it doesn't. What do I mean? You can get a mono microphone output to work with this to make a stereo sound, but it requires you to not plug your mono jack all the way into the stereo receiver. So it doesn't work normally like it should, do yourself a favor, go to a Radio Shack and ask them for the correct adaptor. If it doesn't work, you can always return it."
2419,"I ordered this particular model of polarizing filter for my Canon T3i. It works, but I just can not see much &#34;polarizing&#34; when I look through the viewfinder, and turn the filter ring. However, the pictures are fine. It seems as if an older model of polarizing filter that I had would enable me to visualize easily the changing brightness. This filter does seem to be doing a decent job."
2420,"Granted this is an old review from 03, maybe Sony has improve on thier CD since then, but I have not use them since.----------------------------------------------------------------------Please do not buy, look for a different brand.  You will lose data.I am furious how many Sony's CDRs I have replaced.  They are the absolute worst product out there.  I don't know how such a great electronic company would leak such low quality, unreliable CD-R.  The problem I have with Sony is overtime the CDs become unreadable.  It said not MS-dos error or something when you try to copy the data, basically it become unreadable.  The surface of Sony CDR is a smooth pearl.  After 1-2 years they start to fake off on the edge like watermark.  Not because of careless, but of the CDR surface quality.  Other cheaper CDR I have for 3 years (storage in the same location as the Sony's CDR) are still readable and don't fake.  I lost some important data with at least 4 Sony's CDR.  The files at the outer edge are affected the most.I though the smooth pearl color of Sony was very pleasing compare to other ugly blank CDR.  TDK is now my CDR of choice now.  It has a clean look and it CDRs are more readable on any cd-rom then Sony.  I am in a progress of reburning all data that are on the Sony to TDK.  Again, Warning: Do not buy Sony's CDR."
2421,"As others have noted:PROS:Decent sound, long antenna cord (20'), compact design, clean aesthetics.CONS:Flimsy volume control, antenna can't be attached without removing the battery compartment cover, and VERY ANNOYING high pitched hum that makes you think you're listening to AM radio.  Unless you are willing to put up with this and need the portability, you're better off buying a home adpater and running the receiver through your home audio setup."
2422,"does the trick, not exactly compact or easy to store, but, for what i needed it for it worked well."
2423,"If you are serious about photography, this tripod will be a real waste. This may be good for video shooting, but for serious photography spend some more money and buy a good one. You will never regret this advice."
2424,"I gave this 3 stars, but it's kind of my fault. I have a pair of headphones that has a microphone and a speaker connector (both male 3.5mm). I thought this would let me plug the mic into one female connector, the speaker into the other, and then connect them into my laptop's single audio port. Nope. This is chiefly an audio splitter. If you want to connect two pairs of headphones for some reason that doesn't make any sense, this is your guy."
2425,"With so few sources remaining for IBM formatted floppy disks, I was relieved to find them available on Amazon. With old computers still in use, and with Sony Mavica floppy disk cameras still in circulation, the demand for fresh, new disks, however rapidly dwindling it might be, is definitely still there.The quality may have slipped a bit over the years, since of the many boxes I purchased, each had one or two defective disks that would not read or write, regardless of the efforts to reformat them. Even so, it was still a bargain."
2426,"It certainly downloads the images quickly.  I do wish that I could run it through my USB hub instead of having to connect it directly to my Cube.  Nice product for the price, though."
2427,"I've been using the Finepix 4900 for several months right now and I love the camera's features.  I think the one big negative point about this model is the poor battery life.  If you use the flash and the LCD display, expect about 40 shots before you get the low battery indicator.  I would recommend purchasing a second battery and charger for long trips.The LCD viewfinder is another problem.  The image you get from using the viewfinder isn't very clear in low light situations.  My previous digital camera was the Fuji MX-2900 which had an optical viewfinder.  If you get a chance to compare an LCD viewfinder to an optical one-you would agree that the optical works better.  This also puts another strain on the battery life issue too.Enough on the negatives.  The best part about this camera is the image quality.  It's excellent and I love the 6X optical zoom.  I would avoid using the digital zoom whenever possible.  The lens on this model was the main reason for purchasing this camera."
2428,"Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.What Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.Happy ears."
2429,Works as expected; I decided to go with this one because Belkin is at least a name brand and was worried with a few other on Amazon I would get a poorly terminated or cheap connector.The cable is 'white' in the networking world (it is slightly gray);  however I used to run network cable at an old job and gray network cable is definitely 'gray' (think the color of the bottom of an old Nintendo). Be aware that in your home it is unlikely the cable jacket will 100% match your white trim as mentioned by other reviewers.
2430,"I am returning this ""puppy.""  Some previous reviewers that noted the FM radio reception was poor were dead-on correct.Short story:  The refurb'ed Model 88 I bought years ago from Cambridge SoundWorks last week bit the big one, so I read all the reviews, checked to make sure I couldn't afford a 'Wave,' and ordered the '730 from Amazon.It arrived packed in the usual Amazon fashion, in the bottom of a big, poor-quality-cardboard box with sparse air pillow padding thrown on top.  So, dear reader, do not rule out shipping damage as a factor in its performance.While waiting for it to arrive, I disassembled (What did I have to lose?) my venerable Kloss '88, looked for burned components, tightened plastic connectors, and reassembled it.  The darn thing again began working!I performed ""A-B"" tests on the Cambridge SoundWorks 730 in the same spot, with the same FM stations and external antenna, a C. Crane dipole, I had used with the '88.My conclusion was that possibly the 730 was damaged in shipment; or it had a design flaw in the FM receiver where it had selectivity issues, generated internal birdies that affected reception, simply had a poor receiver, or all of the above.  I could see, given vast differences in working environment how reviewers could rave about reception or complain.In my case, the radio, though with more amenities than my old Henry Kloss box, is lacking in the ""radio"" department.  Amazon gave me the choice to return it or sell it to someone else.  I could not in good conscience sell it."
2431,"Bought a pair of these earlier tonight in Best Buy for a few bucks more than listed here.  Sadly, it still wasn't worth the price!First off, the fit is good.  They stay on your ear really well.  Having said that...The sound is AWFUL!!!  Really awful!  Do not buy these unless you want to waste money on shipping them back.For what you spent on an iPod or MP3 or whatever...spend a little more & get better."
2432,"I was pleased to see these headphones are still in production. I owned a set in college, some time ago. They are every bit as good now as then. I only wish the material used as the ear cups were a bit more comfortable. They are made of a thick plastic that doesn't breathe at all. The result is ear sweat and a sticking sensation on the ears which can limit how long you can have them in operation. Most of the time this doesn't bother me, but there are other times...They are heavy, too. This is not an issue with me. Also, be prepared to run to Radio Shack to get a cord extension since the coil is stiff and doesn't extend too far. Also, you might consider getting an adapter so the headphone can be used with a smaller plug (for an Ipod).Don't let the negatives keep you from purchasing. I would do it all over again to enjoy the superior sound and the clarity these headphones provide."
2433,Does NOT hold a 9&quot; screen portable DVD player as advertised.  I bought this case for my Toshiba SD-P2500 Portable DVD Player with an 8.9&quot; screen and it's too large to fit in this case.
2434,Falling apart. I can't believe they charge money for this thing. They shouldn't even give this thing away. They should pay people to take one and throw it in the trash. They should pay people for looking at this thing and skip buying it. They should pay people to forget this thing was ever manufactured. JUNQUE. They should pay me for warning people off of this tube of disillusionment.
2435,"I bought these on sale and after seeing the reviews. I don't do a whole much with these headphones but plug them into my iPhone to listen to podcasts and the weird music I have collected. It's hard to describe but these headphones are comfortable and they don't seem to get in the way at all, aurally.Headphones are so personal that I can't say these will be the best for you. They're not perfect for me; the cord pulls my iPhone off the table for example. But they're nice enough that they're what I use every day."
2436,This unit didn't work at all. It was completely dead and unresponsive. Frustrating. I purchased a Cyberpower in its place that seems to work great.
2437,This is by far the worse CD I ever used. The majority were bad out of the package. Will never buy this brand ever again. Horrible product!
2438,"I bought 420EX flash for use with Canon's G3 camera, which is one step less than conventional SLRs. For long my indoor photography has suffered. But now with this great accessory, I can bounce light to create brilliant and vivid images. The flash utilizes E-TTL and also adjusts to the camera's zoom.The only reason I rated the flash 4 stars is that the auto-fucos assist beam function is not working with my camera. I probably will get in touch with Canon and find out if this feature is compatible with G series camera or not."
2439,"The product does it job of privacy from the side. But the little adhesive comes out if you take off the filter too often. Its somewhat of a privacy filter because someone behind you can see your screen. But man, taking it off and putting it back on again is a real pain. Especially, when you have to clean the screen sometimes. I have a tablet PC, interestingly it works even for tablets."
2440,"I purchased this to replace my old sports walkman when I forgot to take it with me on a month long overseas trip.  I loved my old one (don't have a model number, it's about 10 years old).  The reception was great, I could change stations by feel, and it took whatever abuse I gave it, which typically included dropping it on the pavement at least once a week.I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with the SRF-M80V.  When shopping I immediately noticed all the changes, and assumed they would all be for the better, but not so.Pros:  It's lightweight, and the shape fits nicely on my arm.  Running with it strapped to my arm doesn't bug me the way I thought it might, and it's a nice change from the radio pulling on my shorts.  There is the option to strap it onto your shorts, but since it seems OK on my arm, I haven't tried it yet.  The reception equals the reception on my old one, and I've never had any complaints.  The headphones are lightweight, and they've shortened the cord, which keeps the excess from flopping around, but limits what you can do with it.  I've only dropped this one a couple times, and it hasn't suffered, but the battery compartment does pop open.Cons:  It brags of 25 presets, but you can't really do it by feel since they are numbered, and not just an up/down button.  When I'm running, I'm not particular as long as it's music and not talking.  Scanning up and down worked pretty well for me.  Grabbing my left arm with my right hand and looking slightly down to see what I'm doing while running is a bit awkward.  Don't know if it would be better hooked on my shorts or not.  The buttons are not recessed, so if you bump anything you get instant station change, or even worse, just a tap up or down on the station you are on.  You can use the &quot;hold&quot; feature to avoid this, but then you have to take it off hold if you want to change stations.  I should probably purchase different headphones, but I'm trying to avoid spending the money.  The headphones are OK, not great, not terrible.  The short cord was annoying this morning when I hooked the radio to my camelbak for a bike ride and it kept pulling the phones back because it wasn't long enough to drape over the backpack and up into my helmet.  The worst feature is the volume control.  For active sports, an up/down button would work best.  Surprisingly they stuck with the dial method.  And the placement couldn't be worse.  Everytime I grab this thing, I inadvertently hit that volume dial.  I cannot count the number of times I have almost come out of my skin when I either turn it on and it's been turned up too loud, or when I change the station and accidentally grab the volume dial.  A word of advice:  don't ever turn this thing on with the headphones on your head, it could damage your hearing.It's nice that this radio has AM/FM/TV/WB, not that I can use anything but FM right now (living in the outback).  Perhaps I will appreciate the 25 presets more when I get back to the states.  But for me, since I use this radio exclusively for running and cycling, simpler would be better.  A sports walkman designed for a blind person would be perfect for me, as I don't want to look at it when I'm using it.  If you're looking for a portable radio with lots of features, you might like this.  If you're looking for something simple to use that will provide distraction from your own heavy breathing when exercising, think before buying this one."
2441,"This little guy gets the job done, its not expensive at all and I'm about to order my second one.####Update:Okay, I ordered my second adapter and it came in, guess what? The product was defective, the 3.5mm jack wouldn't fit, seems like something is messed up internally. I contacted them via e-mail, hope all goes well!***Update 9/9/11***I have contacted the sellers and they sent another one... which was defective as well, I gave up. I haven't had a chance to update the review but, I contacted them a while ago and they sent yet another defective product. Your taking a chance when buying these, try to buy at least 2 to ensure yourself at least 1 useful adapter.( Taking 1 star off for bad quality)[ * * * - - ]"
2442,"I anticipate this is a quality item: cannot find it in retail stores - does anyone know if this requires that a person wear a belt or will it clip to a waistband like a cell phone holster does? Do any slim camera cases have the ""spring clip"" attachment that I am looking for (I dont wear belts)"
2443,"Out in the open air this radio is fine.  But I bought it to use on an above-ground commuter train.  Very poor reception on major AM stations and I frequently have to twist it one way or another as the train moves along to hear anything at all, and even worse reception inside my office building.  If you need a radio for indoor or in-train/bus use, this is not the one!"
2444,"At first glance the Zire appears to be a Godsend.  Fast Processor, Beautiful screen, hidden camera, however Palm again made a mistake by not offering this unit with a flash Rom.  PALM is steadily behind.  There are normally tradeoffs with features from model to model, but this issue causes concern for me.  PALM is regularly releasing hardware that is not ready for the consumer market such as the Zire 71, Tungsten C, (Lack of stereo headphone out or mic and clicking problem.  I am just not impressed anymore and decided to finally go with a Dell Axim 5 and completely move away from PALM OS."
2445,"Save your money, this really did nothing for neither my internet nor TV quality or speed.I should have returned it but kept hoping it was something I was doing wrong, then a Comcast Supervisor came to my home and told me I shouldn't use it.The real problem is Comcast generally and the quality of their signal which can't be improved upon."
2446,Buy this router if:a.  You are a network engineerb.  You wrote the setup softwarec.  You plan on being luckyd.  Your life is so dismal that a weekend spent chatting with the nice ladies in Hyderabad is the best you can hope for!
2447,These are worthless for Astronomical use as the manufacture used a CHEAP tripod mount that renders the binoculars useless for sky viewing.There is no way to steady them. Their next model up 20x80 has a great mount that is used by several other companies. I return these & purchased a 20x80mm one made by Berska which has the better mount. I got them at a great price. $99. from amazon and they work great! I recommend Barska ones instead & save some money.
2448,I have not really used it yet but tried it out and work ok just need it for extending my audio connection
2449,"I bought these for gym use with my MP3 player, but I really didn't like them and have returned them.  Bass was strong, almost overpowering.  Midrange seemed quiet by comparison.  Upper ranges were kind of tinny sounding to my (non-audiophile) ear.They were comfortable to wear sitting still, but the weight of the plug, combined with workout sweat, made the left phone keep losing its seal.  The cord was strongly microphonic - I couldn't stand using it on the eliptical trainer without weaving the cord down my back under my shirt to keep it from bouncing around.I know these are inexpensive phones, but their quality pales in comparison to my over-the-ear open Sennheiser PX-100s, which cost just a bit more."
2450,"Perhaps it's my fault, but my brand new camera fell off and was totally destroyed. I thought it was secure, but it only seemed to be. I'm not pleased with it at all. The mounting is clumsy. I am very unhappy this morning."
2451,I got this for work where I press shirts oddly enough.  Running my hands across the shirts was creating a lot of static for me and this fit the bill to resolve getting shocked all day.  The cords long enough for free movement and the wrist band is easily adjustable.  I really liked the fact that the cord snapped off when I had to run do something as well.
2452,"I ordered this lens after reading mixed reviews of it, but I was really pleasantly surprised.It focusses reasonably fast, and the pictures I have taken of bugs, squirrels, kids playing, and still objects were all sharp with nice color.  I can't wait to try it at the zoo!It is best in bright sunlight and about F8, which I expected, but what I did not expect was that it is surprisingly good at 300mm wide open too.  Also, the IS is a must-have for me.  It enables me to handhold shots at 300mm, which I would normally not be able to do and get sharp pics.All in all, I would highly recommend this lens to anyone who wants good telephoto pictures and doesn't have $1500 or so to get these same features in an &quot;L&quot; lens."
2453,"I ditched my AM6 speakers through eBay and bought some good speakers instead. Anyone who likes Bose must only have their clock radio as a point of reference. I was able to sucker some chump into paying $400 for my Bose AM6 speakers, which I turned around into a set of Athena .5 speakers and a 10"" Velodyne sub. All running from the same Pioneer VSX-D711 AV receiver as the Bose. My new speakers set me back about $350, leaving money left over for speaker wire and stands.So, why am I so harsh on the Bose AM6 speakers? Well, they do look nice, but... they use proprietary speaker wires with speacial plugs. So, you have to use their wiring which really reduces the options for running wiring for the back surrounds. The small size is nice, but having speaker wire hanging out in plain site pretty much sucks.Speaking of sucking, let's adress the major shortcoming of almost ALL Bose products, they just don't sound good. My budget Athena .5 speakers have a 1"" tweeter and a 4"" driver. This combo does a pretty good job of covering down to around 80Hz where the sub fills in. Not completely flat, but really nice for the price and signficantly better than what the Bose AM6 can do with its single 2.5"" driver per speaker. The Velodyne sub can hit 30Hz and really fill in the low end, while the bass module (I refuse to call that Bose thingy a sub) doesn't get any where near that. And, since all 5 speakers are cabled through the bass module, you're really stuck finding a good place to hide it in your room.So, what does all this mean? When watching a Dolby Digital or DTS movie, I can now actually notice the low frequency effects, and even feel them. with the Bose, you get muddled farting from the bass module (and, I suspect the cross over on the bass module is set pretty high in an attempt to compensate for the Bose Cubes' misserable low to mid range response, so you know where the sound is coming from, sort of distracting).The overall sound stage is now much better with the new speakers, too. The Bose cubes were too easily localized, and didn't fill in the room very well. But... most important: when watching a movie, we can now actually hear the dialog! With the Bose AM6, it seemed like the music sound track and other ambiant sounds were constantly overwhelming the dialog. Turns out, this was due to the fact that crappy little cube speakers aren't able to effectively produce sound in that low to mid frequency range, where most dialog lives. Take a look at all the traditional center channel speakers everyone else sells, they usually feature a single tweeter and two or more mid-range drivers of decent size (4"" to 6"" depending on cost). Now, compare that to the single 2.5"" driver found in the Bose cube ""center channel"". Which one do you think will do a better job of reproducing the full frequency of sound needed to enjoy a movie?Sorry to ramble a bit, but I was a chump when I fell for the Bose marketing hype/BS. Now that I've learned that I can get significantly better sound for 1/2 the cost (and I'm sure there are scores of other options), I'd hate to see someone else get suckered in by the hype. So, go back to Amazon's speaker section and try something else; Athena is a great brand;) and I'm sure there are lots of other choices..."
2454,"I plug it in and put it on my ears.  The sound from the songs I play comes through.  It actually doesn't sit on my head right, but I think it's either because I have an oddly shaped head or because I stretch the cord out really far when I listen and it's like tugging on it a little bit.  Just a little.  Great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly.  I drop them a bunch too, so they're pretty sturdy.  Also they are the color of black which reminds me of space, which is cool."
2455,"It was surprised at the build quality of these headphones.  Very rugged great bass and treble, and they fit over my big head quite comfortable.  You will not find a bitter headphone for the price."
2456,"I am a computer service technician and I use this case every single day. Everything inside of it works great! Somethings I would like to see included are extra blades for the exacto knife and some small screws would have been useful. I also have to mention the case feels a bit flimsy, I could see this being a problem if I was traveling with the case a lot. But I keep it right in my shop."
2457,"I have owned two pair of these earphones now, one black and one white.  The white pair lasted less that 4 months, the black pair just over 6.  I keep them in a compartment in my messenger bag, along with my iPod nano, to use on the bus or if I am walking around downtown.  They are not subjected to any out of the ordinary stress, but in both cases, the Right earbud suddenly stops working.  Just goes dead.  I had the second pair die this morning when I got on the bus.  So today, I need to buy new ones...but twice is more than enough chances for these.  Sad thing is, I really liked the sound and the fit they had...but 4-6 months of lifespan is worthless...especially when they are not treated roughly."
2458,Just what I needed to use with my IPad so I can move about.  Pretty light weight but good for the price.
2459,"Have had these for over a year after getting them for a good deal (although more than the $15 they are going for right now) using them daily, sometimes up to 4 hours or more in a row for listening to music while surfing the net or playing video games, and I have been nothing but happy with them.But I recently strayed.  I bought a pair of audiotechnic m50s after reading all the great reviews, and guess what?  I like the Koss UR 20s BETTER.  I was shocked.  Yes, the audiotechnics unquestionably separate the different instruments better, give a crisper sound overall with a slightly punchier base and cleaner treble (for $100+ more they ought to, but the mids are quite recessed and the music more sterilized and not really more enjoyable to listen to, and more than anything, they weren't even close to as comfortable as the Koss ur 20.  They began to become uncomfortably hot like an ear sauna after about 15-20 minutes, and the overall enjoyment of listening wasn't $100+.  I sent them back immediately and am listening to music right now on my Koss ur20s.For $15...  and needing them for just listening to music or movie watching, I just can't even think of a reason not to have a pair of these for around the house or at the computer.  So comfortable I could sleep in them, sound is good with these huge cans, and no ear sauna.  While true audiophiles may need to look elsewhere, They are great for everyday listening and use."
2460,"I can't get earbuds to stay in my ears, so a few years ago I got some over the ear headphones that sit in your ear like earbuds-style.  I really liked them, but so did my dog as it turned out, and she chewed them into tiny pieces.Since I knew that I like the style and fit, I thought I would be quite happy with the Sony MDR-J10 as a replacement pair.  I don't really care about bass or midrange or treble or anything like that while I'm working out, so $10 is the right price range for me.  When I plugged them in to my ipod, though, I found that there was something wrong.  Even a slight movement of the wire where it connects to the plug causes static and interference.  No protective case in the way holding the plug out or anything like that.  I figured it was the one lemon in the bunch.I know Amazon has a great return policy, so I sent them back and got a replacement pair of the the same model.  Exact same problem.  It wouldn't be much of an issue with stereo-type headphones that aren't going to get jostled too much, but for active headphones?  That's a dealbreaker."
2461,"With a new laptop, I needed a new privacy screen for my air travel and those nosey neighbors.  I was surprised that this product only really darkens the side view, not really making it unreadable.  Well, maybe from way over on the side, you cannot see the screen but someone sitting next to me can absolutely see the scree - just darker.  Not as impressed as I thought I would be and not as good as the last privacy screen I bought (which was 3-4 years ago and don't recall the name brand)."
2462,"Having read the reviews I had high hopes but frankly this underpreformed the new Terk HDTVi amplified antenna.  Admitedly I'm in a bad area.  Smack in the middle of Beverly Hills in 2nd story stucco garden apartment.  But even putting this antenna outside it was no different than my 7 year old Terk.  It picked up a Chinese channel and a couple of Spanish channels, probably because of the strong signal strength.  There were still the ocasional glitch though.Now the Terk HDTVi was not much better but it did pick up CBS and KCOP, so two channels more is a big difference.  I'm sure that if you're in line of sight or if signal strength is strong this terk will do the job but clearly the HDTVi is better.I'm not sure what my next step is.  Maybe a rooftop antenna btu I don't want go there.  I'm hoping that the other networks pump up their broadcast signal.  Not sure why CBS is coming in  so well but I supect strength of signal unless they transmit from some where other than Mt. Wilson."
2463,"Not as good as I hoped.  However, it is better than not having one."
2464,"Great sound and comfortable! I have not experienced the discomfort many other reviewers mentioned as a con in their reviews. I use these with my high definition audio recorder, and can hear every detail. I've also used them to listen to music, and have found them to be quite a pleasure!If I were to nitpick, I'd say the coiled cord is a bit cumbersome due to its weight. If you're using this with a small device, such as I do with my Zoom H1 audio recorder, it will definitely need some care so it doesn't tip the device over or pull it off a table. Not a huge problem and not really a con for me."
2465,"I purchased and am returing this product because the management application will not install on Win 7 64-bit (I believe the error was 1628). I tried the app version on the CD and the latest downloaded one, both will not install. There is no web interface, so configuration via this (windows only) app is required. I looked on the Netgear support website and didn't see any mention of this problem, and don't want to spend the next 2 hours debugging it, so am returning it."
2466,I've owned this machine for 3 years and it has now sat in the box for the last two. I have only three complaints:1. Loading CD is cumbersome into the correct slotPossible answer is to create a thin 'slide' like extension that can be anchored to the opening and provides a ramp into the slot. I should swing away into discrete depressions in the top.2. Labeling is a painNot sure how to improve this. But there must be a more automated way like using wireless access to identify songs like on my media center server.3. It won't play some personal burnt CD with my play-lists.I've tried different type of Cd's and it's hit or miss.4. It scratches the CD it playsIntolerable.My final solution was to create a Jukebox of my own with desktop computer and ripping music directly to it. This solves all four of my issues so I will not be looking for another hardware solution again.
2467,"Bought the Terk Advantage 1000 with hopes it would perform better than the little 4"" X 5"" loop that came with my Sangean HD Radio tuner. It doesn't seem to help in the daytime, but at night makes enough difference to note. Tried both air-coupled and directly connected to the ant terminals. The Terk made little or no difference during the day but at night when the stations I want to listen to reduce power the signal strength will increase several counts when I place the Terk next to the factory loop. Unfortunately I still get unreliable daytime HD reception with occasional dropouts of the HD signal.  Tuning of the Terk is critical. Too bad they did not incorporate gear reduction vernier tuning.  Hopefully when the broadcasters finally start transmitting HD-AM at night the Terk will provide enough signal to make it work. I am in the DFW area and the AM stations I want to listen to are all local."
2468,These sound great once they break in. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they're built like tanks compared to some others on the market.
2469,"I like the Koss SportPro headphones.  They sound very good for this price range.  They are well made and comfortable. At this price, they are a great value."
2470,"+ Lots of gee-whizzy 3-D and lighting effects and huge library of objects.- Allows you to embed a cabinet or other furniture into a wall, half in one room, half in another. Doesn't understand the concept of &quot;solid&quot;.- Treats some objects (doors) as measured on center, while others are measured to their edge (windows, particularly the height of the window above the floor)- To move an entire room, you have to move each and every little object that makes up that room. Painfully difficult to select all of the objects that make up a room.- No convenient wizards to walk you through entering existing data about your house to speed the process of replicating it, nor any convenient wizards to then ask what it is that you want to change and help guide you.- Help system is oversimplified and limited to just basic concepts behind the software, not the details on how to use it.Conclusion: It may be very powerful in the hands of the people who wrote it, but it lands frustratingly in the middle-ground between what a DIYer should buy and what a professional architect would use (likely AutoCAD)."
2471,"Sennheiser makes very good headphones and even though this is inexpensive, the quality is still there.  My only complaints are that the sound is really lound and I need to turn down the volume on the computer and MP3 player for those headphones and then back up when these items are hooked up to other things.  My other complaint is the length of the cord.  The wire is not very long and so as I move my head the headphones keep coming out of my ears since the cord is so short."
2472,"Not sure if this really did anything.  Congress solved the problem with the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation, or CALM, Act in 2010. Last year, the FCC set a December 13, 2012, deadline for full compliance.  This is one thing they didn't botch for a change."
2473,"We bought these to use for the family room TV so teenagers could play games or watch videos without all the noise.  These headphones sound OK, but the construction is very flimsy-  headband broke in 3 weeks.  Sony wireless phones have more robust construction and lasted for several years in the same application before being moved to a different room.  We're goong back to the Sonys."
2474,"This is professional grade office equipment, not a consumer product, which is part of the reason for the price.  It goes between the base and handset, so only works with modular connector handsets (NOT mini jacks used for cellphone headsets), and includes a variety of adjustments that allow the amplifier to be matched to the particular telephone's electronics.  I've been using my MX10 for over a decade, during which time many of my other computers and gadgets have come and gone.  I've moved it with me from office to office and through phone system upgrades, attaching it to a half-dozen or so different brands of office phones, and it continues to work well even with the latest generation of Cisco IP Phone to which I have it attached today.To use this amplifier, you will also need to buy a Plantronics headset with Plantronics' proprietary quick-release connector (again, NOT the mini plug used on cellphone handsets).  Contrary to some comments here, this is standard for Plantronics headsets designed for office/call-center use.  As with this amplifier, you get what you pay for - these are not inexpensive headsets, but are high quality and durable.As a switching headset amp, it works quite well, allowing both headset and microphone to be switched between telephone and PC duties.  Conveniently, the amplifier mixes both sources, so you can hear your PC and your phone call at the same time (your callers can't) - that means if you have your headset on for your PC, when the phone rings you just pick up the handset or press the phone's answer button (depending on the phone) and start talking, no fiddling with the amp itself.  Sound quality for calls is good, for listening to music from the PC not so much - this is an amplifier for telephone headsets, not a music player.  I've found it entirely acceptable for VOIP calls (mainly used with Microsoft Lync, but have also tested it with Skype).  I am aware of the equipment hum problem that this unit can have, apparently a problem with inadequate shielding when used around electronic devices (like modern office phones!), but have found that slightly relocating the unit and/or its cables resolves the issue.I guess it's showing its age, but the MX10 remains the best overall solution I've found to this ""one headset for office phone and PC"" problem, and it's very convenient, if a tad pricey.  Given the growing prevalence of VOIP solutions and placing calls directly through PCs, we may not see much improvement in this category.  Though it's just about perfect at its intended mission, I only rate it four stars because (1) I think they could fix the ""hum problem"" with a little engineering effort instead of making me fiddle with equipment positioning, and (2) it's 2013 and well past time for an updated version that provides high-fidelity sound through a standard PC headset/mic jack (but I'm not holding my breath)."
2475,"The reviews that state this piece of junk drinks battery power like it is kool-aid are 100% accurate. I am telling you I have never been so disappointed in an electronics purchase in my life (and I've made quite a few...) I don't know what the answer is. PocketPC is definitely the way to go. Toshiba has a nice form factor. But the first time you get data dump because the paultry battery has given out, you will feel like you were robbed -- especially if you are travelling overseas and can not return it. The only thing that amazes me are the reviews giving this 5 stars. These people must be writing the reviews 15 minutes after they opened the box and have not (no way, no how) used it extensively. DO NOT BUY a PDA until they come up with better battery technology!!! Unless you just love throwing money away.Note: I saw an article on the web recently stating that Toshiba is test marketing a fuel cell battery version of its PDAs in Spain. That might be the one to get when it's available."
2476,"after doing a lot of research, and trying all headphones i could get my ears on; this choice was exactly what i was looking for. i found most popular brands just had too much bass.  the mdr-v6 headphones rely on the true sounds, that were actually recorded, or meant to be reproduced.  i do have to wear hearing aids- so hearing with these headphones is such a pleasure, while listening to music.  i also really enjoy the comfort, because i plug them into my stereo system for late nite t.v.  needless to say i'am  very pleased with the sony mdr-v6 headphones.  the bass and tones are excellent for me.  from 60's and up rock to country, and a little jazz, these things are powerful- but don't overpower the music.  i waited a few days before doing a review, i have thrown every thing i have at these headphones, and am very pleased.  i recommend them to you!  they were very well packaged, and in a funky display box-- pretty cool.  happy customer, thanks amazon!"
2477,"Otherwise this lens is merely good.  I've had this lens for a little over a year and have taken numerous rolls on it in all kinds of settings and conditions.  It does what it promises to, which is to provide a nice wide-to-medium telephoto focal range (suitable for 99% of casual photography) with the fast ring type Ultra Sonic Motor autofocus.  It also lets you focus manually even if the switch is on AF, which is really slick.  If it weren't for these features I might not have given it a 4 because the optics are just not that good.  It's not very sharp at any focal length, and it produces duller colors than the other 2 lenses I have.But like I said, the lens performs as it's meant to - as a better than entry level consumer grade lens.  The USM is so fast that it justifies the lens's optical shortcomings.  Your subject simply *pops* into focus instantaneously when you start to depress the shutter.  I'm about to move on to a sharper and more &quot;contrasty&quot; lens, but it'll be heavier, bigger and won't focus as fast.  The time that I did spend with this lens produced some very nice results and it served its purpose quite well as a solid stepping stone in my continuing education as a photographer."
2478,I found the sound to be sub par. No bass at all. The part that fits in the ear was quite large. Way to big to fit comfortably in my ear. Seems flimsy and not well made.
2479,"This box is *almost* a bridge -- but not quite.  In particular, it ends up putting it's own ethernet address on packets, which is OK for basic IP use, but if (for example) you're using this to extend a network and have a DHCP server on the base-station side of the net, if that DHCP server is ISC-based, it will send responses that don't get correctly forwarded.  On the other hand, if you're just forwarding a link, and have a NAT or other local DHCP server on the WET-11-side network, it'll work fine..."
2480,"These headphones are terrific. I use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies. I have had them for a few years now, and they still work just as good as the day i bought them. They have a nice long  cord, so you don't have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player. If you  are looking for a set of headphones, these are one of the best for its  price range."
2481,I have had these for a long time. Excellent product. Recently my wife was telling me that I had black dandruff and would knock a few very small pieces of some kind of black material from the side of my face. It took 2 months to realize that the specs were coming from the headphone covers. They were slowly deteriorating.The good news is that there are replacement covers for just a few bucks. Should be here tomorrow.Update: Received the new covers and while it was a job putting them on I prevailed. The headphones look brand new.Still rate them as a 5.BillCape Cod
2482,"I've had 30 days to live with this thing extensively, and I thought I'd share with you what I've found out.  The rating is really 4.5 stars, but I just can't give it a perfect score for the price they are asking.The Jukebox is excellent for what it does, which is put every CD you own at your fingertips.  You should know yourself if you have a use for this or not.  The Jukebox is perfect in the car or at work, where it is unfeasable to bring 100 CDs along.  You don't have to change CDs, and you can edit the playlists to reflect your tastes at any given moment.  When I was sick for a week, I had my complete collection at my bedside.  Long trips would also be an excellent time for the Jukebox.Seek time between songs is about the same as the pause between songs on a CD.  The hard drive inside makes noise, but I wasn't distracted by it.  The case is exactly the size of a portable CD player, and only an ounce or two heavier.  The Jukebox is Creative's flagship model, so everything is high quality.  The package includes a nice carrying case, excellent-sounding headphones (which are a bit tight), extra batteries, all the cables, etc.If you have extremely sensitive ears, don't expect any MP3 player to have true CD audio quality.  This is a compressed audio format, so you get what you pay for.  I love the sound quality, but a recording studio technician might hate it. And don't expect to take this jogging.  Although it can be done, the Jukebox is certainly not made it.  It is designed to be used on a desktop, plugged into the wall.Unfortunately, the battery life is way too short.  You will need to buy a power adapter for every location you use the Jukebox regularly. (i.e. home, work, the car...)  Carrying around the power cord defeats the purpose of portability.  A power cord for the car is not included.Lastly, the price of the Jukebox (and MP3 players in general) is way to high.  Be careful that it doesn't get stolen.And the final test - I use this everyday!  I love it.  Navigation is easy, everything is easy.  I certainly got my money's worth."
2483,"Most comfortable headphones I've worn in a long time..  Night and day from my previous set.Sure, the sound quality is awesome, that much I expected....... but the comfort... amazing.  I can see myself wearing these for hours without a thought.Anyone else who says these are uncomfortable either has a really large head and doesn't know it, or simply isn't telling us.  These have room to spare on my head and my head isn't small... I""m 6' 220lbs...Either way, these are awesome.  Definitely would recommend these to anyone."
2484,"I've discovered Amazon has been mixing reviews for multiple products with a similar name together.  When I originally reviewed this, I was reviewing an older, more expensive, and great product.  Since then my review got associated with a different product... I've bought two of these newer mice, and while they're reasonably comfortable to use, they seem to be very unreliable.  I've had TWO of them have mouse buttons go bad in just weeks to months of use (one black, the other white).I've since switched toSteelSeries Kinzu v2 Optical Gaming Mouse (White)which so far has been both comfortable to use (more so than these new Microsoft mice) and reliable.  Yes, it's almost 4x the cost...but that's what mice used to cost, and it actually *works*.  Comes in multiple colors too.  While it's labeled a ""gaming"" mouse, don't let that scare you away if you don't play games and are looking for a normal mouse.  It's a nice feeling 'normal' 2 button + scroll wheel button just like these, but feels nicer, has a braided cord, and...actually works.  I'll update THAT review too if I need to, but right now it's my ""go to"" mouse I'd recommend to anyone looking for a nice normal mouse.Here's my old review that was addressing an older Microsoft mouse, before Amazon associated the review with this new, different model:***************************************I'm needing a new mouse, and just stumbled across all the reviews for this model...I've been using this for YEARS at this point-probably close to a decade-without a single incident.  I will say it seems like Microsoft's hardware lasts longer than Logitech's.  While this thing's been going strong for at least 6+ years, a Dell branded mouse I just got late last year is already dead.I'm going to replace it with another one of these.Yes-the mouse cursor occasionally jumps across the screen.  This isn't unique to this mouse-I've seen it on ALL optical mice I've ever used (and track pads for that matter).  I've yet to use anything that works better than this mouse.Regarding the ergonomics...IMO that's entirely personal preference.  I like the standard ""two buttons + scroll wheel button"" setup.  I don't particularly want more buttons I can accidentally hit, so this normal layout works well for me.  This design is physically smaller than Microsoft's ""wheel optical mouse"" design, of which I also use a few (they also work just fine).Which is better?  I don't really know.  This feels good in my hand.  The other design felt a little big at first, but now I like it fine too.At any rate...I wouldn't be scared off by these.  It's just a bog standard layout mouse that works as well as anything you're going to find, and it's comfortable, I think."
2485,But it is not. Was a waste of money to order this.  The offering for the Innova 3160B and other products recommends you also order this for updates but if you have an USB computer (99.9% do now) this cable was wasted. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Just another way to upsell you.
2486,"Very disappointed.  I have other Netgear components on the network that have worked flawlessly for years, but this particular model does indeed have the issue many people have reported about disconnects.  I could see how an average email checking / web surfing user would not care much about it, but I use software for work that requires a full restart when disconnected, so this switch drives me absolutely crazy.Every few hours everything attached to it just disconnects, as if they are plugged into nothing.  Sometimes it comes back up in about 2 minutes, about 25% of the time I need to unplug the unit and plug it back in to get it to reconnect to the computers again.  I am back on Amazon to find a different switch and figured I'd warn everyone that this one is headed for the trash bin here.  I still believe Netgear makes a great product, just this particular unit is flawed. Funny sidenote, actually disconnected me two times while writing this, don't think it wanted me to warn everyone about it. :-)"
2487,"i really wanted to like this monitor.  it comes in a nice, sleek package and was very easy to set-up.  color was acceptable, as well as response time.  however, text was fuzzy no matter what i did to adjust.  not terrible, but not as sharp as i had expected.  in the end, this monitor went back to amazon (which still has the best return policy in the universe!). ..."
2488,"The first thing I had to do when I received this in the mail was measure the length of the cord due to my curious nature since all the other similar cables come in at only 6 ft. The result was it measures somewhere around 6 ft but not even close to 6 1/2 ft as advertised. Some might feel this is minor nitpicking, but still I (and a few others apparently after reading similar reviews) don't appreciate being deceived. For my needs, the cable itself worked fine though. I use it to charge and use my PS3 controller for my desktop PC where it's hooked up behind the back of the tower. So for me, the extra 6 inches would've been appreciated since I felt a 10 ft cord was too long.2 stars off for the false advertising."
2489,"I felt that this lens necessiate IS and without it, its mostly unusable due to the percentage of blurry shots you get. That is because at 100mm, you need a shutter speed of at least 1/100 for mostly blur-free shot. So i look at the IS L version of this lens but that was out of my budget. I then came across EF-S 60mm/f2.8 lens and realized it will require only a 1/60 shutter with no IS and could deliver steady shots so i purchased that lens and am much happier. The 60/2.8 actually gives you same optical quality as the 100/2.8 - it is superb both for macros and for portraits (espacially if you have an external flash). Consider getting the 60/2.8 if you have a crop-body camera over this lens. For full-frame users, if you are using a tripod then this lens definitely works over more expensive L version otherwise the f2.8L IS will be a better option over this. Though if you are serious in macro photography, the 180mm Macro is best and for portraits, you got lots of other options including the excellent 85/1.8. But if you want both a macro and a portrait lens for your FF, this is pretty good."
2490,I ordered four of these cables and one was defective so I'm giving it three stars becuase I don't know if this is a comon problem with this product.
2491,"Just bought this kit recently to put my new gaming pc together. It's a pretty nice kit to have. The two phillips screwdrivers are useful, although they could be higher quality. When really torquing the screws into the plastic on my fans the screwdrivers got stripped out a little (the screw was stronger than the screwdriver). They are good sizes though and for anything that doesn't give a ton of resistance (I ended up using my cordless drill for those fan screws, so they weren't easy to screw in) they work well.Most of the other tools won't be used much if ever, but one tool really stood out. The screw picker-upper thingy was extremely useful. I was able to get into hard to reach areas and start the screws in the motherboard holes with only one hand, which was very, very handy. It would've taken me at least another half an hour to screw in the motherboard without this tool.The main downside is that I think it should have come with the anti-static strap, and ditches some of the other less useful tools to keep the price the same. An anti-static strap is absolutely necessary and some of the other tools in the set are pretty useless, so I would've preferred one of those to come with the kit. All in all, I think this kit was a good buy."
2492,"This thing is junk, won't even pick up some of the local stations that broadcast &lt;10 miles from me. I have a CS degree, build all my computers, etc so it is definitely not a user error but rather a pos product. Gave it 2 stars instead of one b/c it does get a few channels, just not nearly all the channels it should."
2493,"Not the greatest product. The first problem I encountered, I could live with; every couple of months I would lose all Internet access and would have to turn it off, then on again to fix it. Since that was a rare problem and easy to fix, I didn't mind much.However, after a couple of years, it developed a more annoying problem: the wireless network would go away and then come back repeatedly - anywhere from several times a day to several times a minute - on all my devices (2 laptops, Droid phone, and a Roku box on the TV). I tried switching the wifi to different channels, but that didn't help, so I don't think it was due to interference.Time for a new router, and it's not going to be a Netgear!"
2494,"Just what the title says. If all you do is surf a largely static net, then this is as good a router as any & works both wired & wirelessly without problem.If, however, you do any sort of net-intensive things on any of your connected computers/devices (game online, share files, p2p, stream, etc) you are in for a terrible experience.I am one of the latter and this router now sits gathering dust waiting for my folks to get high-speed where they live since they will only have lightweight demands."
2495,"Good sound quality. Good price. Convenient in-line mute, mic and earpiece volume controls.  Versatile.  Will get uncomfortable for all-day users. IMO better than similar Panasonic (with the silly foam covered boom mic)."
2496,I was a bit disappointed in this item. The rewind button will not stay locked when rewinding. You have to hold it in place in order to rewind it. Cheaply made. :(
2497,I use it to extend my headphones from my computer and I always have to play with the female connector and my headphone plug to make it work.
2498,"This was a sale item, and as I had lots of DVDs to restore, I thought a motorized device would do the trick. I was wrong. The feel of this product is very cheap, and the size of it quite large for the measly bit of repair it does. Its larger than an early gen. cd player. Not really very important to its functionality, so lets move on.The cleaning heads are 2 rotating pieces of plastic with green and white cloth on top, on which you are to pour a drop of cleaning agent before beginning the cycle. you are provided with 2 extra cleaning heads and the cleaning fluid. The heads are placed inside, followed by the dvd or cd you want to clean, laying above them. The device is closed much like a cd player. Plug the device's bulky power adapter in and press the button, and wait. Its agonizingly loud as it spins the cd and cleaning heads. After a minute or so, you check the disk out. Generally, it takes 3-4 spins before any improvement can really be noticed.I dont really see the advantage of this product over a mechanical cleaner. The motorized nature of this just makes it bulky and loud, but adds nothing to the cleaning ability of it. I would recommend just buying a less expensive repair device that you spin manually, or going for something more advanced that spins the disk faster or uses a better cleaning mechanism."
2499,"Stay away.  The thing has some sort of memory leak in the software.  Expect to reset the unit every 5 hours or so or else it slows to a crawl.  It doesnt crash, just slows down.I found out Toshiba lied with their specs of this unit.  It will not support any SDIO card other than toshiba's bluetooth card.  So you cant do any sort of Wifi with this unit.  There are so few accessories that you must accept the unit as is.My solution was simple:  Return it and get an Ipaq h2215.  It lacks the 1 touch recording feature, but it's smaller than my wallet and feels much more sturdy than the 355.  It also has the full version of Windows Mobile, rather than the scaled back one in the Toshiba.Toshiba support was awful:  They couldnt tell me if the Host adapter cable worked with anything other than a keyboard:  And that ended up being true.  They tout the USB Host cable as being able to let you connect to printers, etc.  All it talks to are mice and keybards.  Sick!The Photo software that this 355 comes with is useless.  Dont pay more for it.The Ipaq 2215 is about 2 steps up from this unit in price, but there is an equivilant Ipaq, not sure of the model #.  MY advice:  Get something with ""SDIO Now!"" drivers that allow you to talk to most SDIO expansion cards out there.Stay away from the low end toshibas.  I love the 755 though, that's a real killer machine."
