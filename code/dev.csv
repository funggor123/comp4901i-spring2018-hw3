0,2,"A mouse is a rather personal decision.  People's tastes and requirements  when it comes to mice (and keyboards) vary greatly upon what they do with  their computer.I tend to be very hard on mice; The Logitech MouseMan  Wheel Optical is my third mouse in 12 months.  Thus far I am very satsified  with it.The Ups: great feel.  My previous mouse was the MS Intellimouse  Explorer (the grey one).  In contrast, the MS mouse felt very cheap to me.  The tactile response on the Logitech is much better (the buttons have a  nicer 'click' feel).  In fact, the thumb button on the MS mouse broke  (stuck ON, of course) which lead me to try this one.  How it illuminates  was also a nice surprise.The Downs: Logitech makes a great piece of  hardware, but I do not like their drivers as much as the MS mouse.  The  Logitech drivers do not work in all games the same way as the MS drivers  do.  Some games do not even register the wheel turning (very  disappointing).Overall: Probably the best mouse out there for the cost  (or regardless of cost, for that matter).  I love the feel and would  recommend this mouse over any other that I've used to this point."
1,1,"it's a good unit. sensitive to pressure, meaning while playing if you hold it too tight it will throw off the sound. Not sure if it will last over time. I needed it for a quick job and now it sits on my shelf till the next time. This unit is inexpensive and you get what you pay for, I knew that at the time of purchase.It served me well."
2,0,"I don't know if this problem has been fixed in newer versions, but version 3 has a problem with port forwarding where it tracks old connections for 5 days which cause it to quickly stop working when you use any P2P app such as uTorrent or Limewire or anything else that creates a lot of connections. After I had this problem and my wireless internet stopped working, I tried upgrading the firmware to DD-WRT but that made it worse so I tried changing the firmware back to the latest linksys build but it still won't broadcast the internet. (I can see and connect to the network it creates, but the internet doesn't work even when I'm connected.) I'm done trying to troubleshoot this stupid thing and will never buy this model again. But like I said, mine is v3 and newer version may not have this problem."
3,1,"I like the product, but the one thing that kinda bites is the fact that the camera is on a pivot from the frame and the cord, is heavy which will make positioning it difficult."
4,2,"This backpack is a very high quality product and is very compact (too compact for me). I was so pleased with the quality, however, that I returned the item and just got the next size up, the Expedition 4."
5,0,I use a Google Pixel (runs Chrome OS) which only has USB ports.  Unfortunately this unit doesn't work although the Chromebook will support any driver less adapter but this one just doesn't cut it.
6,2,This hard to find product was exactly what I was looking for. Amazon really does have everything!
7,2,These are actually a replacement.  My first set lasted for a few year and needed another.  Best earbuds for the money hands down!
8,0,"I use large quantities of matte CD labels for inkjet printing, and was very pleased with the Memorex brand for ten years:  colors printed vivid and true, the labels were easy to apply and adhered well.  But the most recent pack I bought proved  completely different.  Their new paper has an obvious grayish cast that takes color poorly (e.g., reds look brown, blues look gray), and the finished labels look dull, muddy, and cheap.  This new paper is also so thin that ink bleeds into the adhesive layer, and the labels are prone to wrinkling during application, ruining the CD.What was once an excellent product has been cheapened into one too shoddy to waste a cent on.  I will never use Memorex labels again."
9,2,"first, returned my handspring visor delux, because of the usb connection was unstable with my win 2k machine.  decided to go with the wireless palm.  the palm side, is great, it has a faster cpu then the handspring, and the updated palm os.  the serial hotsync works every time.  battery life is poor because of the fact it is always charging the transmitter.  thus, if you never go on line.  don't buy this model,the m105 or handspring delux with 8mb of mem is fine...the palm service is very expensive and not worth it at all.but as for the palm, it is great, and works fine"
10,0,"This product became extremely frustrating to own the minute I needed it - a power failure.  I was in the middle of heavy design work and it beeped for about 30 seconds before it died and didn't even help the PC hibernate.  This has happened since for 2 years. Now I am here shopping for a new one, NOT MADE BY APC.  I need to replace this one and I realized what I waste this was.  It's a glorified surge protected, and should NOT be used for anything serious.  It will indeed fail."
11,0,"I purchased this router 7 months ago.  After 6 months with no problems, the unit suddenly stopped working. A call to Netgear produced unsatisfactory results.  Technical Support will NOT talk to you unless you pay a premium.  With only six months elapsed on a 3 year warranty (I notice that now Netgear only offers a 2 year warranty - interesting) I was not happy.  I did not want to spend any more money so I tried the online support.  After back and forth for a week, Netgear finally issued an RMA number so I could ship the defective unit back (at my expense).  The only acceptable service in this whole mess was the turnaround time.  I mailed it (priority) on Jan 8th and received the replacement Jan 15th.  The router worked 1 whole day and died Jan 16th.  ""As a courtesy"" customer service decided to talk to me after verifying that I had just received the new (defective) router.  That phone call turned into 3 as I was cut off twice and had to keep calling back (too bad they couldn't call me back since they have my phone number-that would have been much better customer service).  Each time I had to repeat my story (always write down your Case ID # so they can find you) so I ended up speaking with 3 different technicians who each had me do something different (which is my complaint with the online support - different people, something else to try [all of which I had done prior to calling]).  The last technician referred me to a supervisor who assured me another replacement would be sent out promptly.  She said I could throw the bad unit away.  15 minutes later she called back asking for my credit card information to ""authenticate"" me.  I refused stating that she had confirmed all my info prior to hanging up.  She refused to let me speak to someone with more authority, telling me my repalcement couldn't be processed without a credit card, although she assured me I would not be charged for a new unit or shipping. So why do they need my credit card?  Customer service has not called me but I did get an email from them issuing another RMA.  I am furious as I will NOT ship their defective product back to them (particularly since the supervisor told me I did not have to and could toss it) nor will I give them a credit card (which I am guessing goes to people in a foreign country based on their hard to understand accents).  Netgear has lost another customer, my computer is unprotected at the moment but before I unplug my ethernet cable, I will file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau."
12,2,"Works as advertised, well worth money spent Koss makes great products for the home or car, so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for you!"
13,0,"This might be good for one cable or a couple of wires, but it does not have enough room to meet my needs.  I was looking for something to cover a coaxial cable and a couple of pairs of speaker wires.  The channel for the cables on this cover is less than 1/2"" by 1/2"".  It is closer to 3/8 x 3/8"".The sides have furled up and do not set flat on the floor."
14,2,I needed a small CB radio for my truck i  have manual transmission a 5 speed i also have a ham radio a Alinco 220 radio i needed a small radio to go next to my 220 this one fit perfect more than satisfactory for my needs i will include a picture of my setup soon
15,0,I was going to buy this to power a Sony SW radio I have as I try to spend a month in Israel every year. The Sony weighs a bit and I would have been very sorry to take an adapter with me that did not work. Thanks for the advice.
16,0,"We've used at least fifty of the previous item with this model number.  They work.I ordered one of these since I needed another.  It never worked.  Tried on Linux, Windows 7, Windows XP.  I think that we got winxp to notice it.  However, it never was more than an entry in the USB table.In short, defective.Now, I read a lot of reviews on Amazon that say the same thing.  Does this mean that there is terrible quality control (since the basic item works so well), or does it mean that Amazon keeps sending out the same defective one that gets returned.Maybe one of us should mark the defective one when we send it back to Amazon.  Then, the next guy who gets it would be able to tell that he was just sent an item someone else determined was bad.  Just a thought.Of course, it could be the manufacturer just has bad quality control.  Maybe they should step up.  Of course, if you go to D-Link's website, good luck finding this item.  They really don't want to be selling these."
17,1,The band is a little too thick on this cap saver.  I have bought others in the past and the bnad was thin enough to wrap around the end of the lense in the groove on the end.  This strap is much thicker and you can't do that.  I had to wrap the strap around the grip of the lense.  It works but not what I was used to using.
18,1,"I brought this memory on the recommendation of Reviewer: R. Geissman ""rlgeissman"" (Lodi, OH United States).  I have an E-machine T1300 1.3 GHz Celeron system that is a step up from the E-machine T1220 and the memory only reads at half the capacity. Instead of the chip reading 256mb it only shows 128mb. I had used the PNY Configurator that indicated that I should use 256S100 but R. Geissman recommendation was too strong to pass up.  Well, I must say a lesson learned.  No hard feelings R. Geissman.  I'm going to order the PNY 256S100 and see will it do the trick.  I hope this review helps someone who has an E-machine of this model."
19,2,"Appears to be well made. Easy to fit. I won't give it 5 stars though, because I think that $12 is a lot of of money for a small plastic bracket and a slightly modified battery compartment cover, especially when the eTrex only cost me $108 over five years ago."
20,0,I bought this card to help my son's laptop receive the signal on his laptop and after installing it;  it did not show hardly any difference!  He still had a hard time getting the wireless signal in our home while my laptop did great with a different type of card!So one star for fast shipping and one for the price is the best that I can do at this point!Maybe someone else has had better success than us!Thanks!!!
21,0,"I bought a pack of these based on the high-ish review of them.  When I received them, I realized that a lot of people don't have an idea of what a really GOOD screen protector should be like.  Yes, these are adequate for minor abrasions and scuffs, however, they are much too thin and rigid to be good for a long period of time.  As other reviewers have said, these scratch easily (more easily than your LCD would without them).  While I was pressing out small bubbles with the edge of a coin, I noticed that it was leaving scratches on the protector.  The screen protector from another company on my other camera is significantly thicker and feels more fluid than these ones.  This made it easier to remove bubbles and while you could create a ""scratch"" in it by pressing your fingernail hard into it, the ""scratch"" would heal itself and be invisible about 30 seconds later.  I have had this protector on the camera for almost two years now and it still looks as clear as the day I put it on even through moderate use.  I have NO expectation that these screen protectors will last even 1/4th that long as look as good as they do at application."
22,2,Very well built and very protecting. It's only weakness lies in that you can not plug a PC cable or 12V cigarette lighter power supply cable without taking it off.
23,1,good sound but way to heavy. I can't handle the weight so I returned the headphones and got a pair of bose.
24,1,"This is a great card and a great idea from a reliable company - as long as you don't have a complex system running Windows 2000.After I installed this card on my system, all chaos broke loose. This eventually caused Windows 2000 to become corrupt and crash and burn. I had to totally rebuild my system from scratch, wasting many hours. So it is buyer beware.It turns out that this card needs four IRQs. Now I already had a soundcards, a couple of  Adaptec brand SCSI cards, and a graphics adapter. Problem is that under Windows 2000, all of these PCI cards are assigned IRQ 9. (The only way to prevent this (on my system anyway) is to disable ACPI Power Management - a job bigger than Ben Hur). Result: hardware conflict, system freeze-ups, driver corruption, and BSODs (Blue Screen of Death).In summary: The DuoConnect 3121 is a good card. But if you run Windows 2000, have a lot of PCI cards, and you don't know an IRQ from ACPI or BSOD, then better stay away from it. Go for something simpler, like an Adaptec 4300. I am told that the DuoConnect 3121 installs without problems on Windows XP, which is more flexible with IRQs.Yet I do not entirely blame the Adaptec company for the problem - though they could have warned me, the unsuspecting consumer, about the insallation risks in the marketing brochures! So therefore only 3 stars.I can't fault Adaptec on their very good support. Adapter cards from other companies are cheaper than Adaptec brand, but the Adaptec support is worth the extra money. Which is why I replaced this card with another card from the same company. Adaptec refunded my original purchase price (but not the many wasted hours). So therefore at least 3 stars."
25,1,"When I got this cable it felt a little cheaper than high quality cable.  It also measured slightly less than the standard RG6 diameter, creating some problems for loose fit of my ends.  The other issue was the coil was so tight and stiff that it made this cable difficult to unroll and distribute without kinks or tangling.  The cable seems to perform well and when stripped it has good copper, insulation and wire wrap.  I am looking for a better supplier."
26,1,"First of all, Bose took a month to ship it even though it was said to be in stock.  They are the maker.  There is no excuse for this.  If I'd have known that I wouldn't have bought it.The thing is really inefficient.  I have it set 14db higher then the Cerwin-Vega it replaced.  While this is OK with a really powerful receiver, most will clip on that channel with the volume up when the others are running at higher volumes.  Not very good.  You could buy a huge amp to run this, or probably a better move would be to pass it up and look for something with at least a 5 1/4 inch driver.The size is small, and that is nice for me.  It is for my garage system and it sits on my workbench under the TV.  Space is at a premium so this gets high marks for that.The sound is very nice.  It does a very nice job on voices.  I like the sound a lot.Overall, it works for me.  The sound is nice.  It puts a considerable limit on your system volume because when it is running at a proper volume that channel is going to clip when to others are just cruising.  I don't play my system too loudly so it works well for me.  Bose is way too slow to ship.  I got it from them because it was $100 and much less than anywhere else.  If I'd have known it would have been a month to ship I wouldn't have gotten it."
27,0,"I've had one of these for probably 5 years now (the original PAL, not the iPal).  While the device is supposed to be weather resistant, I found that after about 18 months the tuning knob became very ""dirty"" and staticy when tuning. I think this is due to moisture getting into the case.  We keep the Pal on a shelf in the bathroom, and I suspect the steam from the shower did this.But the serious problem is something I've just noticed recently. The rubbery material the case is made out of has started to deteriorate.  The rubber case material has gotten almost sticky and can't be cleaned. And if you make the mistake of trying to clean it with Windex, the material almost melts.So you're left with this device that's totally absorbing all the dirt that comes in contact with it, and can't be cleaned.  Even just a damp rag makes the rubber case sticky now, leaving marks in it and not getting the dirt off.I've seen other rubber things break down this way- usually it's the little rubber feet on older components, or certain cables.And while the Tivoli still works now, it's kind of gross looking and worse is kind of strange to touch because of the permanent stickiness.This is an expensive radio, and I just think it should have lasted longer than it did.My only other operational complaint is that there is no ""AUX' input switch on the front panel... you have to plug and unplug the jack from the back, which makes switching from radio to Ipod a hassle."
28,0,"Mistake #1 I originally bought the combo so I could sync my pda since it's a bluetooth device, but MS doesn't include the required bluetooth profiles. Mistake #2 Even though the keyboard and mouse have great designs, the MS Bluetooth transceiver can not function properly with any other Bluetooth transceiver on the computer system. So buying a Bluetooth USB adapter from another company and installing it will not work (its either the Microsoft transceiver or a competing company or neither -- However, bluetooth profiles for the keyboard/mouse combo are not included with competing companies bluetooth usb adapters).Too make a long story short, at this time, a decision to have a bluetooth wireless keyboard/mouse combo or a different bluetooth usb adapter to allow syncing of pdas and other devices must be made. YOU CAN NOT HAVE BOTH. While installing both devices will work initially, eventually the wireless connection will be lost and more time will be spent unstalling and reinstalling the combo than actually using it. Mama Miah"
29,0,"I own one of these. Every day or two, it will flake out, requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in in order for the computer to recognize any connected devices. Furthermore, whenever I try to use my USB scanner, the scanning application crashes in mid-scan. None of this happens if I use my old Linksys 4-port hub. Guess this goes into my drawer of broken electronics. I'm buying a Linksys 7-port hub instead."
30,2,"Garmin GPS's have fairly good battery life, but after a couple of days of using your Garmin in a car, the batteries are going to be dead. Drive a long distance in one day, 15+ hours, and the batteries in your Garmin will be dead. This can be very anonying if your out RV'ing or Off-Roading for the weekend or the week.So Garmin has fixed this problem by making a Cigarette Adapter and PC Interface cord that attaches to your Garmin GPS.Now you can cruise around all day with all of the features of your Garmin GPS turned on, and don't have to worry about the batteries dying. I think that is a big plus.My only complaint is that I wish the cord was longer. It's good length, but some how I feel that I am going to need a longer cord one day and it's going to annony me that it is not.So, if you drive alot with your Garmin GPS, get this and save money on batteries."
31,2,"This eyecup does fit on the T1i but it isn't like the original that came with it in two ways. One good, one bad.First the bad: it's too wide. It does slide down but only with a little effort. Once it's on there, it's VERY snug. It also is wider than the original piece and really prevents you from using the little wheel on the right side of the viewer hole - or whatever it's called. It also covers up most of the word 'display' but not the display button. It does not interfere with the proximity sensor that shuts off the screen when you go to take a picture.Now the good: it's too wide. Yes, same thing but in the good category, it's wider and therefore softer on the face in a larger more comfortable way. Also, the HUGE bonus is that the rubber surround is not loose and likely to fall off like the original eyecup. It's a better quality of rubber and it's glued to the plastic housing.I was going to return it after realizing it's not the one I was expecting but after a minute or two, I realized it's better even if it does cover that little wheel I never used. Hope this helps any T1i owners out there who lost that cheap rubber surround as quickly as I did."
32,2,"I've used this mouse for the past few years at work.  I'd had some hand/wrist/arm discomfort from frequent mousing and purchased this -- as well as theFellowes 98915 Antimicrobial Split Design Keyboard (Black), which btw is wonderful.While almost frustrating to learn at first -- until you get the thumb motion down, the cursor can be devilishly difficult to control -- within 1-2 weeks I was not only mousing with ease but had completely eliminated all arm/hand pain.I recently set up my home office more ergonomically also, and decided to purchase the corded version of this mouse (Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical (Silver)).  Not only is it a better color (the darker silver better hides smudges and wear) but it doesn't use wasteful batteries (approx 1 AA battery every 4 mos.)...and I don't have to worry about finding an out-of-the-way-but-still-effective place for the receiver.  Since both the corded and the cordless take up a USB port, and since both mice remain stationary (you move the cursor with the thumb-ball, not the whole mouse), and since the cordless receiver is on a long wire anyway, I don't see any point in spending the extra money -- the initial higher price PLUS the cost/hassle of batteries -- to purchase this cordless version.Had I known these things back when I first bought this mouse, I'd have chosen the corded version.  But both are excellent mice, that can help you say goodbye to arm/wrist pain forever."
33,0,"I just started dating a woman who owns this system, and she was so proud of it that I simply didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.  On our third date she took me back to her apartment where we watched a DVD: beautiful plasma TV, horrendous Bose hunkajunk.  The only reason I kept my mouth shut was because she's incredibly hot and I wanted to be there for breakfast the next morning.But it took a lot of drinks for me to sit through this audio nightmare: male voices often came out of the so-called ""bass module"" instead of the tiny and tinny little satellites, and those voices were mixed in with the smeared, flabby mid-bass coming out of the box...totally localizable mid-bass.  The music (we watched ""Amadeus"") was completely hollow-sounding, like listening to a boombox.  During a few musical peaks there was even audible resonance coming out of the pseudo-sub...no surprise since it's just a cheap plastic enclosure, not even MDF like you get with even the cheapest REAL subwoofers.Mama mia, the things a guy will do just to get some play...For four hundred bucks these days you could actually get a pair of real bookshelf speakers (Infinity Beta 20s, Polk Monitor 30s, Hsu HB-1s) and a cheap sub (Dayton SUB-100 from partsexpress dot com) that would effortlessly destroy this Bose junk.  Granted, it won't be in such a tiny and dainty-looking package, but it will sound a million times better!I think I'll have to break the news to her on our tenth date or so, it actually makes me feel DIRTY not to, heh."
34,0,"These CD-Rs from TDK have been a real disappointment - they don't play in some CD players, will play sporadically in others...there's a problem here that, in my experience, seems specific to the TDK ""music"" discs."
35,2,"great item.  used for night time sleeping. operation by roller dial, easy and efficient item will buy a second for spare"
36,0,"Love the iPod. hate the remote.after 2 years, mine finally broke for good. It had a habit of splitting open for some reason.My complaint is the general design - that clip.. it barely works unless you are clipping it to thin material. After 2 years of trying to get it to stay on my bag's strap or my jacket lapel, I am frustrated.I am surprised that no one has produced a better version of it."
37,2,"So I was in the market for a great pair of phones. Was looking at some grados, but they are pricey. So when I found these I was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio. Must say the look and feel great, and the sound quality is just fantastic. Would definitely recommend!"
38,2,"I'm reducing my rating to 4 stars from 5 stars. It still looks great, but as others have mentioned, the double-sided tape on the back only lasts between 6 months and a year. I've had to put screws into the wall to keep these up. Not a huge hassle but it would've been nice if it just worked as it came out of the box. That said, I'm still buying more as it's still the best system on the market.Original review belowThis kit's extremely expensive but there simply aren't a lot of options out there to keep your wires neat. If you're leaving it white you can have your wires neatly installed around an entire room in less than an hour. I cut mine with the cutting wheel of a dremel with no issues. Besides the price I only have two complaints. First, the kit comes with lots of unnecessary pieces/connectors. I wish there was a more cost effective way to purchase just what I needed. Second, if you're painting it, plan on LOTS of coats. My home theater required these to be a deep red, it took between 5 & 6 coats of a high quality paint (it only took two coats on the walls) to get a streak free finish. Now that they're up, they look great; you barely notice them at all."
39,1,I have about 150 mini-disc's and while it lasted it was great but because of it's condition it did not last very long and its now worthless.It never recorded very well I wish they were made more rugged but they are very fragile.I only received the player but none of the accessories thank god I still had some from a previous model I had bought new when they first came out.Hopefully when I can afford it I can find a more rugged model that will do all that's expected of it. Like I said though it was great till it's demise.
40,2,"This control is pretty cool, it works great but you have to be pretty close to your camera."
41,0,No instructions provided - just the adapter in a plastic bag. HP inkjet printer. I read in the user reviews how some people have gotten it to work and went through the steps. Tried different suggestions for hours. The only way I could get it to print was to let the print job fail and then reboot. Upon startup the printer would then print the job. Obviously of no use. Very disappointed.
42,2,"I just got my new camera, a Canon Eos Rebel T4i and needed a bag. I didn't want a big bag and i know i will be getting a backpack later on . So my goal was to find an inexpensive small bag for everyday use.  This fits the bill.  It has two &#34;modular&#34; inserts that can be removed ( they attach with Velcro)  and the bag has the ability to be worn on the shoulder, carried in hand or ( which i totally missed when i got it ) worn around the waist..It's very well made, you can get this bag with confidence as long as you want something small ( it fits my camera with the zoom lens and the battery charger maybe a filter or two but not much else)."
43,1,I loved these Sennheiser headphones.  They were comfortable.  The sound quality was great. The noise canceling during flight was excellent.  Unfortunately the left ear stopped working today after 18 months of moderate use.  The only thing I didn't like was the cord.  I ordered another set because I love the sound quality.  I have my fingers crossed.
44,2,"Awesome little headphones, some of the best sounding set I have ever owned. They're a little rough to look at, but I am very glad I gave them a try. These sound terrific, and adjust for your ears with lighter pressure, if you so desire. The only drawback I would see for these has to do with their higher impedance, at 60 ohms, as opposed to a lower impedance for most portables out there. The higher impedance means that batteries would empty quicker when used with mobile gear, but well worth the money for the sound. Amazing product, I will buy a second pair as a back-up."
45,1,"Good for outdoor that is why I had to have another one to replace the retired from abuse its predecessor. It has a very simple no-brainer operation. Good solid water splash protected housing. Backlit but not bright to disclose you in a dark display. Unfortunately support completely dropped by Garmin: no software for other than 32 bit Windows PC having serial port, and you will have to hunt the MapSource maps for it. You cannot connect it to USB. The only solution would be to keep an instance of Windows 32 bit as a virtual appliance just  to  continue using this device. This pocket navigator will not replace a good GPS enabled tablet with satellite imaging, thermal, Doppler and topo overlays but it is sealed, has a descent 3xAA battery cycle, and I see the best use it for situations where there is no room for more toys, where FRS radio communication is required in a spotty cellphone grid,  and environment would simply kill your tablet or cell. Best for something like moving across country terrain or bushwhacking through a swamp. The radio part is good enough (FRS, repeater,GMRS) but unfortunately Garmin's PTT or VOX headset or laryngophone either not available or very poor quality."
46,2,"My main reason for preferring this film is because, as far as color goes, this is rich color with a reasonably high ISO.  I'm not really that worried about grain since that's part of the draw of shooting film nowadays (at least it is for me).When I shoot on film, I use a Pentax ME Super without a flash, hence why I use ISO 800, since when I'm at f/2.8 I can shoot comfortably in a reasonably well lit room.  And when I'm shooting on overcast days, this film still keeps the pictures looking good.The final reason that this is most often in my camera (if I'm not shooting Kodak bw4oocn) is because its affordable and readily available.  Fuji makes great film and this is a solid performer for general use.My only concern is that I've had some issues with the film being to tight and it some rolls have been a little hard to load or to catch on the winder (its simply harder to pull out of the cassette).  Half of that is user error, but it seems like I have to try more often to get this film to catch in the mechanism (and in an point and shoot camera you probably won't notice if the film isn't actually advancing).  Just be careful loading and it should all go smoothly."
47,2,"Works great - use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby... so far so good, and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb..."
48,0,"This Sony earphone is a nightmare to use.  The earbuds are too big and the clips don't fit properly.  Its a nusiance to get them on and they don't always stay on.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The price was good, but if they don't fit, whats the point.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Pass on these earphones!"
49,0,it does not say anywhere on the documentation of the item that it is not Windows vista compatible.  I tried to look for drivers and there are none to speak of.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to return this item because my housekeeper accidentally threw it away.  If you don't have vista I'm sure it works fine.
50,1,"Some context. I spent the last 10 years using Thinkpads with the pointing stick in they keyboard. I seriously considered not buying anything but a Thinkpad (there are other reasons), but I wanted a portable gaming rig and landed on a Dell M17x. I hated the touchpad, so I needed a pointing device.The mouse is very comfortable and sold feeling. I have largeish hands and I can get to the main keys and the ball easily enough. The have only found two issues. The ball can get a bit sticky on my fingers which manifests itself in pointer movement when I take my finger off the ball. It's not normally a problem except when I am doing detailed graphics work. The other issue is that the left mini button is easy to get to and functions as a ""back"" button which is really handy. The right mini button serves as a middle button, but since it is located at the top of the right side, I have a very, very hard time to reaching it with my index, ring, or pinking finger. It is almost unusable. There also seems to be a driver requirement that simulates the third mouse button--it doesn't work in games or in VMware.I am happy with the mouse, but not that excited. Frankly, I don't think I would be happy with any mouse other than a pointy stick."
51,1,"I am a headphones fan. I like to try as many as possible to find the perfect set. I believe I found the best overall with the brand Ultrasone. However, seeing how many positive reviews this set has, I decided to give it a try and decide if my impressions for the Ultrasone headphones were justified.I kept the headphone for one week and made sure to give it as much as a burn-in as I could by letting it play every night with a selection of various musical styles. I ended up with about 50 hours of burn in...My final ratings for these headphones:Pros- Very good sound overall.- Nice buildCons- BulkyI decided to return these headphones at the end. Sennheise makes very good headphones but I find myself more satisfied for the range of price with the Ultrasone HF1-15G which are cheaper and deliver as good or even better sound and are 1000x more confortable."
52,0,"I live 35 miles out of town in the mountains where reception is poor - but with our regular old aerial antenna we have acceptable image and fine sound and 2 channels; blurry images on 3 other channels. This Terk TV5 doesn't work nearly as well.  The two best channels are just white static unless you turn up the amlification to full, then there's just the ghost of an images buried in the static.  The other channels just aren't even there.  I used my grandmothers 55-year-old loop antenna at the same house and it gets much better results.  I'm returning the TV5."
53,2,"I had a Koss CD player when I was little, and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system.  It made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with KOSS headphones.  I can't say enough about these lightweight, gorgeous-sounding, funky headphones.  PortaPros have a lifetime warranty, look like something out of Tron, and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction.  Buy 'em, and find something else to worry about, in life.  Highly recommended."
54,0,"they don't work or work for very short period of time, and then for some unknown reasons they stop working.  It's a great idea but the construction of it leaves much to be desired.  I hate through money away on junk like this no matter how little it was."
55,0,"Fast lens in a compact package, especially given the reach on an APS-C body.  Sharpness is good across the field and even impressive wide-open.  Out-of-focus area look mostly nice, maybe a little bit of green fringing on blur circles.  A negative, everyone who wants to buy this lens is likely very much aware of this, is the heavy purple fringing on high contrast transitions.  This is not unheard of with other Canon telephoto lenses (my 200mm L lens does i too), but a bit more pronounced than in others.  This does improve a little stopping down, but still very much visible at F/2.8.  So far I therefore agree with most other positive reviews.  However, one reason I got this lens was for indoor sports.  After taking it to the park on a sunny day (shooting at least at 1/2500 sec) to try it out on running dogs and some pick-up basketball, that bubble burst:  Zero keepers out of 60 shots due to missed focus (using AI Focus and Servo).  In direct comparison, I used my 100mm F/2.8 Macro (non IS, same camera, same settings) and got about 40% keepers.  Even when I was not tracking moving subjects, I found the auto-focus a little inconsistent with a tendency to front focus. Maybe it's the specific sample that has some problems here, but I can only review the one I got."
56,2,"This is a good value, works well for both time-lapse photography and low light conditions. I've read about the battery running low because it does not have an off switch but when I'm finished with it I just turn the battery upside down and it shuts off. Works well."
57,0,"I bought one at Costco, and ended up returning it (thanks to their excellent return policy). Here are my thoughts:1) It's pricey, and for the money the included headphones do not fit well, and fall off in sports activities.2) The battery life is very short.3) The clock/date resets when you change batteries!4) The controls are very easy to accidentally hit in sports activity.5) No crossfading of songs6) The FM radio is difficult to use, and has poor reception.And finally,7) It may look rugged, but despite the fact that it is even in a padded belt clip, falling just 3 feet onto a carpeted floor made it break. Not very good for sports, eh?In short, I cannot recommend this unit for it's intended purpose of a sports mp3 player.A"
58,2,product dimensions lend very well to easily blending into the background and easy access to add/subtract cables in the run as needed
59,2,"I tried the Sure e2c's as an attempt to upgrade from my normal Sennheiser MX500's.  The Sures are sturdy, very inconvenient to use, and I couldnt get them to seal properly in my ears no matter how much fidgeting I did.  So I bought the Plug, another MX500, and still saved at least 25 bucks over the Sure productThe Plug sounds terrific for the money.  The sound isolation was good and they were easy to fit to your ear properly and produced a good all around sound revealing sounds absent when I use my Sennheisers.  The bass is more prominent but didnt seem out of balance...it was just easier to hear and a little muddy &lt;what can you expect for 12 bucks?>.  I listen to a lot of rockin blues, and these are perfect because you can hear the typical basslines in a standard blues band group better.Is the Plug better than the Sure which is far more expensive?  For me it is, but only because I could get the Plug to seat properly in my ears and couldnt with the Sure. I think the Sure e2c's would sound awesome if they would fit properly, albeit lots more inconvenient to use."
60,2,I rated this a 4 out of 5 because I'm not impressed. It does the job of holding the GPS. It does require replacing the back of the GPS to get correct mounting. Easy installation on handle bars.
61,0,"The idea of this keyboard is great.  The execution is poor.  I bought mine to carry in my carry on baggage on business trips.  I have not done anything to it that would have damaged a cheap usb desktop keyboard, and yet this thing just stopped working.  I probably got 5 uses out of it.  Maybe it is great for leaving on the kitchen counter, but typing on it was never comfortable, and it is far from indestructible."
62,1,"I bought this Palm model after losing my m100 during a business trip.  Instead of purchasing the same old model, I went for an upgrade with the m130, since it looked identical to my old unit plus it had color.  The process of migrating the old data from my PC to the new unit was very simple (Fortunately, I kept my data synchronized in my PC on a frequent basis).The m130 works exactly the same as my old m100, making the learning curve minimal.  I also noticed that the stylus graffiti recognition is more effective than in my m100, reducing the backspacing and correcting.The unit includes a HotSync cradle which is not only used for synchronizing but also to recharge the batteries.  Obviously the cradle requires electric power.I found the cradle a bit heavy and bulky and difficult to store in a notebook's briefcase.  The engineers at Palm should have considered, for those of us who travel, making the cradle more compact and lightweight.  You have no choice but to bring it with you everywhere since it is required to recharge the unit's short-lasting internal battery.  Now,  a bit about battery life.In my opinion, I consider the m130's battery life to be very short. My m100 used 2 AAA batteries that lasted more than a month.  The m130's last a day or two and possibly less with heavy use.  You need to get used to recharging it daily.  Fortunately you can reduce the screen brightness by lightly tapping the power button while the unit is on to save battery life.In summary,Pros:  Palm's reliability and reputation, ease of use, upgradeable, enough basic memory (8MB), clear display with good colors.Cons: Heavy and bulky HotSync cradle, very short battery lifeIf you use your Palm for personal purposes and/or do not travel a lot with it, then you may disregard the Cons.If you do a lot of traveling you should consider obtaining a unit with a longer-lasting battery and a more compact cradle/recharger.3 stars"
63,2,This must be the 10th pair of headphones I've purchased in the last 5 years.  But I've finally found the one.  I read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound.  And it's great!  I am amazed at how much bass these things produce!  They also fold up well and clip together.  It should be easier to find the cord around them but that's just a minor annoyance.
64,2,"If you have a device that allows for headphones, but doesn't have a volume adjustment, this is for you.I've been using this to ""tone down"" the audio that is sent from my Xbox 360's audio dongle. The volume control has lasted well since the purchase, with no visible signs of wear, in spite of being used while traveling. Also, the sound quality is pretty good, with no detectable leakage.I would greatly recommend this."
65,1,"What is remarkable is how small this case is for such a big price. If you want a case to hold your 2720, beanbag mount, remote control, and cigar lighrer adapter/speaker...this is not it. Simply too small.Instead, go find yourself a nice camcorder case. I found a $15 one at a Meijer stare on closeout for $4 and it amply holds all these things. Something garmin's $25 case cannot hope to do.Dumb product, unless you just want to protect the base unit and nothing else."
66,2,"Replaces the old cable release of yester-year. I only gave it 4 stars becauseit is rather expensive (to me) for such a simple item. But it works great,and you need one for any exposures done from a tripod - especially forportrature."
67,1,"First, this product is twice as much directly from Bose, even though its exactly the same.  So, even though its much cheaper here, even at this price, I don't think this product is very good.  It does what it says it will do, but it is poorly designed and not very elegant considering it is holding up $700 speakers.  It even has ugly gaps above and below where you can kind of see the mounting plate.  It works, but is cheap looking and has horrible directions.  Surprised Bose would support this product."
68,0,"The Grundig FR200 Emergency Radio has the right features except no Solar aollector.  It's radio section worked OK,  Nothing special, but it did work. The Flashlight feature  might be a life saver in some situation, but  I am not sure I need that integrated into my radio.  What did not last was the dynamo as a power source.  the Dynamo still makes power but very early, it stopped being available to the radio for some reason,  I took it apart and traced it. the rechargeable battery was easily charged by cranking for five minutes but nothing would get that electricity to the radio or light.  Basically what befell it is a cheap switch and poor quality control at the factory.  If an emergency product is going to be this expensive,  you need to make it better."
69,0,I was so excited to get these.  I love the color but otherwise BIG disappointment!  They will not stay on my ears at all.  The only way I was able to use them was to turn the volume all the way up and hook the ear piece on my shirt.  Even then they had to be readjusted often and where difficult to hear.  I would not recommend these.
70,0,"I purchased a Panasonic DVD-RP62 progressive scan DVD player for my HDTV setup.  It was the most expensive of the others being displayed, so I figured it was probably the most functional (had more features).  I found this to be wrong.It is obsolete before it was marketed.It does not play any of the rewritable DVD formats, like DVD-RW and DVD+RW.  Since DVD writers are popping up everywhere, and many of my friends already have DVD writers on their PCs, it's hard to imagine an expensive DVD player NOT playing rewritable discs.I found a Sony model that for the same price does play the DVD rewritables.So once again, price does not mean the same as features.Make sure your progressive scan DVD player play a variety of computer writable media type BEFORE you buy it!"
71,1,"Have had a baseline Palm for a while and eagerly awaited the 'mobile/connected' evolution.  The i705 sounded perfect.  After using it for a while I have come back down to earth and think it's close, but not yet.Palm positives are:  nice quality feel, Palm compatibility, comes with scratchpad software and documents to go.Mobile positives are: always on, nice multimail client, AOL Instant MessengerPalm negatives are: same old palm, low res screen, no color, low light, no jog dial, few new applications, same old buttons.  Essentially [more expensive than] a basic palm with same features (except for mobile).  The keyboard was kinda cool as an optional plug in  but I see it more as helping someone decide which paradigm they want (pen or keyboard), and then buying a PDA with that integrated in, like a treo.Mobile negative: Mainly cost and performance. You have to go to the [more expensive monthly] plan to avoid overcharges and that is about 2x what you should pay.  Next problem is the performance.  It's an older, slower technology.  Even in my large city, it worked only OK for emails, but AIM was unusable as it is too sensitive to dropped packets apparently (seems so).  And lastly of course, no voice phone ala treo (I know, not supposed to be).  But if one was really connected, one uses it (like voice over MS Instant messenger).  Last whine is that the email really won't work with corporate email.  this is not a surprise, but limits the real usefullness of the device for professionals, until/unless their company agrees to support the thing.Bottom line...an expensive offering that only melds a standard palm with a SMS-level email service for public internet.  A great attempt and nice to try, but my [money] will go elswhere..."
72,2,"I've owned a pair of these speakers for several years.  I have been and continued to be amazed at the sound quality these very cheap speakers provide.  They are part of my budget ""home theater"" system in my bedroom, the other components being a 1970's Pioneer receiver, a five year old Pioneer DVD player, and a Samsung 16"" CRT TV.  Theater on a budget!Several years ago, I was taking some very nice used bookshelf speakers  back to a hi-fi store to trade them in on larger speakers.  Just for fun I wired one of these beautiful little wooden speakers to one channel of the Pioneer receiver and one of these Audio Source speakers to the other channel.  Then I moved the balance from left to right and back a few times to see what the difference was in the sound.  I was amazed to find I could not hear a significant difference in the sound!Anyway, I've enjoyed going to sleep to jazz on FM radio, and watching DVDs with the sound coming through these speakers, for several years now.  It makes me wonder if all the hype about expensive speakers and specs in the hi fi world is just a load of...well, you know."
73,0,"The claim that the Macally slim keyboard is a ""scissor switch"" keyboard is PATENTLY FALSE.  This keyboard is decidedly NOT a mechanical switch keyboard of any sort.  Anyone who thinks otherwise need only pop off the extra key that isn't used, below the shift key on the right.  If you pop this off, which you can easily do with your fingernail, you will see a scissor-like mechanism, but the SOLE FUNCTION OF THIS IS TO HOLD THE CAP IN A STABLE, ROUGHLY LEVEL ORIENTATION!  THIS SCISSOR-LIKE MECHANISM HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT ON THE FEEL OF THE SWITCH!!The switch itself is contained within the little plastic capsule that looks like a miniature bottle with a neck.  When you push straight down on the top of that neck, the neck inverts down into the capsule.  The feel is slightly different from the feel of a typical membrane/dome switch, but the difference is negligible.  To the extent that there is any difference in feel, it has only to do with the behavior of that little bottle-shaped plastic capsule, and has absolutely nothing to do with that little scissor-like mechanism that you see under the cap!I REPEAT: THIS IS _NOT_ A SCISSORS-TYPE MECHANICAL SWITCH!!!For intents and purposes, it is an ordinary membrane/dome switch.In a true scissors switch, the mechanism introduces a non-linearity between motion in the direction of the key cap travel and motion in the direction along which the spring is compressed.  It is this non-linearity that gives the mechanical scissor switch its characteristic feel.  This keyboard does not use this mechanism!  It does not have the feel of a scissors-type mechanical switch, because it is not a scissors-type mechanical switch!This is just a cheap, run-of-the-mill keyboard.  The mechanism is cheap.  The force is excessive from when you first start to depress the key.  The top surfaces of the individual keys are much too flat, and because of this, my fingers tend to wander from side-to-side, so much so in fact that I have difficulty keeping my fingers on the home keys.  Despite the scissor-like mechanism that is supposed to hold the caps level, they tend to wobble when you press the key off-center.  The exacerbates the difficultly in sensing the centers of the keys, and this is highly annoying.  In high-quality keyboards, there is a cylindrical protrusion on the under surface of the caps, that slides within an opposing cylinder, thus preventing the cap from wobbling.I can find nothing in particular to like about this keyboard, and no reason whatsoever to recommend it.  It is just a cheap keyboard that is fully in line with the cost.  If you want a keyboard that feels like a cheap $25 keyboard, then this one is probably as good as any.  But it is NOT, I repeat NOT a high quality keyboard that you can buy for $25.  You get what you pay for, and nothing more."
74,0,"I've owned this product for about a year now and felt compelled to write a review because of how frustrated I am with this product.  I have AT&T DSL, and apparently, the AT&T DSL router has the same IP address as the Netgear router.  It took several phone calls between Netgear and AT&T, but finally, this problem was resolved by designating specific DNS addresses to use (4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.1).  Setup otherwise was relatively easy, and the router worked though it would intermittently not work, and I would have to reset the router (unplug it and plug it back in).  At first, it would work for a few days, but now the router has to be reset at least once a day, and it's getting really annoying because the router is in the basement and my office is upstairs.  I've already updated the firmware on this router and confirmed that the problem seems to be with the router rather than my DSL modem.  Anyway, Netgear support was fairly responsive over email but they wanted me to adjust MTU's or packet sizes or something until the problem went away (at this point, what they were telling me to do was beyond my understanding, and the support people were only interested in telling me what to do rather than explaining what they thought was the problem).  At this point, I've had it with the router, and I'm looking for a new one that just plain works."
75,1,I bought two of these speakers they worked good with my 400 watt amp then One of them blew. Ig i cant complain for price but still come on. Hope i have better luck with the pyramid 8 in subs. i just ordered the other day.
76,1,"Edit: The guy at Rat Sound discovered many of the HD280's problems are caused by the flimsy cheap driver housing that vibrates and resonates except when something solid is placed against the housing.  This headphone's driver housing needs a re-design with either higher density or thicker plastic, or with (even better) magnesium alloy.  The driver in it is capable of good performance.----Original review:I compared them today back to back. I've heard the Sony many times in the past, even owned them for a brief time. Senn had deeper bass, but a dip in the upper bass and a touch wooly in one or two midrange spots. Sony, while it didn't go as deep, lacked any significant dips or wooly aspects from the upper bass to the low treble. The Sony was still potentially a touch too bright, and when the material allowed that brightness to shine though those highs could get hard, especially on dynamically-compressed (I don't mean mp3s) recordings... maybe even harsh. In the past, I found them a lot more harsh, but maybe my hearing isn't what it used to be. The Senns treble, though not quite as bright or at all hard, was still a touch bright over neutral and could be a tiny tizzy or fizzy or something.  Not hard, not harsh, but lacking precision.  Neither headphones had amazing extension up top or sparkle, but they were both about average in that respect. Neither had fantastic micro-dynamics throughout and both headphones tended to flesh out different frequency regions of low-level detail more than the other. Sony still seemed a little glassy in the mid-band, but its flatness there more than made up for it. The Senns had nice micro-dynamics in the lows, but its upper bass suck-out prevented it from fully exploiting that lack of distortion. This also contributed to a lack of apparent tightness. Sony has the upper bass and while you'd expect that taught quality to shine completely through, its inferior micro-dynamics down there prevented it from fully exploiting it. Still, that Sony upper and mid bass had fair separation when there were obvious layers and didn't blur them into mud, even given this characteristic or its lack of the lowest octaves. The Senn was a touch more open and spread out in imaging, but lost some of the immediacy and engaging quality the Sony grabs you with. I found neither great or fully flat & extended, and both had their strengths and weaknesses. With the appropriate material or sources to match its strengths, the Sony was the easy winner... but you had to be aware of its quirks and limitations. The Senn was more tolerant of material & sources, but never soars as high, metaphorically speaking.  The Sony might range from a 5 to 8 in sonics, while the Senn hovers more safely in the 6-7 range... if that makes sense.  It did go very low, was more forgiving of high frequencies, and isolated better.  The Sony wins on durability, though, as there is a body of complaints on hinge or headband breaks with the Senn."
77,0,"The unit works fine; I haven't ever had functional issues with it. It gets quite hot - be sure to use the rubber feet and don't pack them too tightly. (There is no fan.)HOWEVER, Netgear warranty service is now quite bad. One of these units (two years old) just died on me. We spent two hours being bounced from one person to another; our call got dropped three times(!); we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in; and at the very, very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements AND WOULD NOT ISSUE AN RMA UNTIL THEY GOT IT BACK IN STOCK. In other words: just sit around, keep calling back; we can't even send in the dud until they are good and ready.I think next time, I'll try another vendor.If you do decide to buy this unit, consider buying two. You may not get a bad one replaced in a timely fashion."
78,2,"I've worn out two pair of these phones in the last decade. The sound quality was great. Wonderful bass--the only phones with  better have been phones that fully cover my ears--and aren't really &quot;portable.&quot; These stayed comfortable for the excruciatingly long flights from SoCal to northern Norway, even while wearing glasses. They fold up nice and small, easy to tuck away. They also performed adequately while watching airline movies ... more than saved the price of the phones over several trips!I have two complaints: 1) hair easily penetrates the &quot;speaker grill&quot; and makes irritating noise against the actual speaker membrane. 2) The speaker, while reproducing sound well, can develop tears in the membrane easily. BE CAREFUL! Nothing is more annoying than a buzzing speaker at 33,000 feet (well, perhaps sudden cabin depressurization ...)!My second pair wore out about the same time as my vintage walkman. I replaced the setup with a Nomad II MG &amp; a pair of noise cancelling headphones--they make a _huge_ difference!Five stars for sound quality. Five stars for comfort. Five stars for portability. Five stars for durability. If you're not going to spring for noise cancellation and you need a folding pair of phones, then get a pair of PortaPros."
79,0,"After a year of use, I tossed it out as the velcro on it could not stick anymore and I got tired of its basic function. It tightly fits the camera and thats it. Good for a night out, not for travel. I guess I would recommend for the look of it if you are not on travel...but definitely not recommended for your next trip abroad."
80,2,"I'm not sure if you can still purchase APS cameras, but if you have one film is hard to come by. They don't even sell it at the drug stores. If you use it I would say stock up no because with reduced demand and the fall of Kodak it could suffer the same fate as betamax."
81,1,"Upon unboxing I was surprised to find no power switch and a Made in China sticker on the sub.  Not good.  So I hooked it up to my iPhone and it sounded a bit too boomy with the sub adjusted to the 10 oclock position per the instructions.  Watched a movie on laptop and the audio clarity is definitely there, but system lacks depth.  Perhaps the drivers need break in time.  For a $100+ analog setup, I'm not too impressed.  This system has been around for awhile, and folks rave about it, but I think newer versions are getting cheaper.  Lack of a power switch means current flowing through components 24/7 wearing them down.  Lots of reliability problems too."
82,0,"I have an HP LaserJet 4ML (postscript) and an HP DeskJet 5550 - relatively common printers.  I have a PC running Windows ME and an iMac running OSX.  I haven't been able to get either computer to work with either printer (the printers work fine when connected directly to the computer - but that defeats the purpose of having a print server).  I struggled with the useless manual for hours, then called tech support (twice).  The tech support people seemed as clueless as I was.  We walked through the standard printer setup process but still nothing worked.  Using the IP address of the server I can use the web browser to see that both printers are connected and properly identified by the server, but for some reason the print jobs won't go through.  I bought this product based on the reviews I found here, but somebody should let me in on the secret to setting this thing up.  After an hour and a half with tech support (NOT a toll-free call) they basically had nothing more to offer.  I'm curious if this is a problem with HP printers - I know HP sells its own print servers - maybe 3rd party servers don't work???  If that is so, somebody should say it.Bottom line - if you intend to use this with an HP printer you may want to ask lots of questions and verify that it will work before you buy it."
83,2,"For what these cost they do what they do well. They're very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the ear-piece adjustment. As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.Sound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image. Overall I think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review. They've also been surprisingly durable."
84,2,"This is a really great trackball. I have used the original PS/2 version, then got a USB and now went wireless for work. Works quite well.However, I think it's time for Logitech to create a similar one to use laser for better precision. At times it feels like the movement is not 100% accurate (as if there is a slight lag in movement). Not really noticeable though unless you have used a laser mouse before (very smooth movement).This is definitely a lot more comfortable than most trackballs I have used."
85,0,"Good lens are expensive and when people find a nice piece of glass for cheap the buzz goes around. Many time that buzz is spread by people who have never owned or used the lens. It becomes automatic assumption that because it is a 50mm prime, it should be great. Don't believe the hype.The first buzz about this lens is its advantage to the Nikon equivalent because this lens will AF with all the Canon Rebels DSLR. Just be ware that the AF on this lens is horribly inaccurate so you will end up having to manual focus anyways, and that is a pain because of the design of the AF ring.The second buzz about this lens is that it is great for low light photography because its f1.8 max aperture. Just be aware that this lens is useless at f1.8, it is soft and flat in color, and I mean it.  This lens becomes useful only after f2.8 so the whole low light advantage is only a myth.To be honest, I have gotten better and sharper results from the camera kit lens and for that I would caution you to spend your money wisely on a different lens."
86,0,"Initially, sound was good compared with the competition.  But within a couple of weeks, I started getting all sorts of crackling sounds.  The problem is probably in the submini phone plug making a poor connection with the handset.  I had the same trouble with several handsets.I have put the product in the trash."
87,1,"I am also a victim of the dreaded ""dead after warranty"" problem.While the Basslink was working, it was perfect. It filled out the lows in the music on my car stereo with rich, clean bass. I couldn't have been happier. But about 1 year into ownership, the Basslink would start randomly cutting out for seconds at a time, then would come back on and work normally for weeks before repeating. The problem then increased in frequency until it finally cut out for good right after the warranty period expired. The power light still comes on and the wiring is still securely connected, but no sound. I looked around, and it seems like I'm not the only one. Check out all the negative reviews on the Crutchfield site. The positive reviews are probably from people who have had it in their car for a month or two and are dazzled by its performance, as I was.I loved the way this thing sounded when it was working. It was amazing that such good, clear bass could come from such a small package. It's a real shame that they keep having these problems - I'd buy another one if it weren't for this, but at the current price it's just too much to be considered ""disposable"" after a year or two.For the great sound it produced while it was working, I give it 3 stars. For it's reliability, I subtract two, leaving 3 stars overall."
88,0,"I purchased this item at the end of April 2003.  Everything was fine.  I used it only a few times, then it sat for a few months untouched.  Then in November 2003 when I went to use it again, there was absolutely no display.  Swapping out batteries made no difference.  I went to the Memorex website... they don't even list it.  I don't have a clue as to why the display went out.  It plays, but without a display it's next to useless.  Of course now that more than 30 days have elapsed I'm stuck with it.  $60 wasted.  Don't buy this item."
89,2,"I bought a pair of these a few years ago based on their popularity and stellar reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. I bought a second pair to keep handy in my basement with my home theater system for when it's late and I don't want to wake up my wife while watching a loud movie. These are very comfortable to wear (as opposed to earbuds, which I can't stand and are generally weak on sound), and I haven't owned or used a pair of headphones that sound as good as these, including some $100 closed-ear models. The sound is clear, with the right balance of bass and treble. A lot of headphones do not have enough bass, or if they do, the overall sound is muffled. These find the right balance, and sound great for music or movies. And at this price, I doubt you could beat it."
90,2,"Yes, they look strange.  Yes, they look like a futuristic design from the 1980s--and indeed, they are from the 80s.However, for the price-range (under $60 or so) there is no comparison.  Still none.  These things have been on the market for ages, and folks still rightly rave about them.I remember using these babies on an old Sony Sports Walkman (tape) and the sound was amazing--big, fat bass, and loud.  These are unmatched for bass, period, in portable headphone in this price range.  They put the others to shame.Yes, they are bizarre-looking, and slightly awkward to fold up, and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two.  But if you're more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a Discman or an iPod rather than looking cool on the street with cooler-looking (but inferior) headphones, these things are perfect.  Highly recommended.  No accident that Koss (an American company, no less) hasn't changed up the design of these in ages--they don't have to.  If you want something a little 'sportier' and smaller, try the SportPro.  Not as powerful, deep, or loud, but excellent in their own right."
91,1,"... but not quite as well as it says.  It will carrying the signal from my iPhone to the receiver and will play at a comfortable listening level, but you won't be rocking out with this, the distortion starts at a fairly moderate volume.A good stop gap until I finally make that jump to a bluetooth radio for the car."
92,0,"This is Nikon in name only - the durability is just not there. Nikon created a plastic toy that looks and acts like a Nikon FM/FM2 but it is not the same. The plastic build does not hold up under use and repairs are more than the camera is worth. If you baby your equipment, then maybe this will serve your needs, but if you are looking at it for teaching purposes - then do not waste your money. I strongly suggest buying a used Nikon FM from KEH or someplace for half the cost. You will get a much better built camera that will serve your needs for years to come."
93,1,"I knew this lens did not have stablization when purchased, but even in best conditions I had difficulty getting clear, sharp shots.The problem might be with my own skills or perhaps possibly a defective lens, but I didn't want to work so hard every time I wanted a decent picture.I returned this lens and purchased the Canon EF-S 55 - 250mm lens. This lens is much better suited for me (although more costly and still not the best lens for extremely sharp telephoto shots but fairly easy to acheive clear shake-free pictures).I gave the Tamron lens 3 stars because more skilled users no doubt will get better results than I."
94,2,Used for laptop at Senior Center so no-one could leave with it.  It was easy to install on laptop and put thru cable hole on desk for security of the laptop.
95,1,"Perhaps I got the random statistical quality control failure, but mine often squeaks and it's annoying.  I was drawn to the Sony name brand, with a reputation for quality, but I'm disappointed with the performance of my particular unit.  I suspect that if I played the music loud enough it might drown out the squeak, but that's not the norm for me, and it's particularly disappointing when listening to soft music.  That said, it does function, and it's hard to argue with the price, so with that in mind I give it a ""fair"" rating."
96,2,"My second tripod, I purchased this after buying my Canon Vixia HV-30 and realizing that It didnt have a LANC port, so I didnt need an expensive tripod with handle controls. The head on this is amazing, allowing for incredible pans. The head is extremely fluid with easy control levers. Its heavy enough to be sturdy, yet light enough to cary around no problem. It also comes with its own carrying case which is really convenient. The reasons I give it four stars: The head plate comes off easy, but when putting it back on the lever has come back and jammed into my fingers numerous times. One of the other main reasons I purchased this tripod was that I do a lot of night time photography, and this tripod allows for vertical shots. Having my heavier camera on there tilted all the way forward to do a vertical shot felt very unstable.Other than that, all around great tripod."
97,0,"This was my first charger and I liked a lot of its features.  It has the attachments to become a car charger or a home charger, it has a door that can close to prevent dust/damage when it's in transit.  It also has the absolute best system I've seen to date of changing from AA to AAA battery charging.  It uses a flip-down tab thing that's hard to describe, but suffice it to say that the batteries are extremely easy to get in and out.  My major gripe was that like with most chargers, you must charge in pairs, either two or four at a time.On the flip side, the thing is not very durable.  I used mine lightly for maybe a year and now it refuses to charge batteries.  I put in a dead pair of Energizers and the charger light turned green, meaning fully charged, in less than ten minutes.  Testing them, of course showed they were still dead.  I think something's wrong with the sensor.  It may have been screwed up from the beginning, as the batteries never did give me much run time in my camera.  I threw away some batteries thinking they were bad, but those two I mention testing?  I tried 'em in another charger and they worked perfectly after that.  Whoops.While this didn't happen to me, I feel I should also mention my parent's experience.  They left some batteries in the charger, possibly to long knowing them, but regardless they blew up.  It was just described to me as a loud pop and one side of the charger being blackened and not working, though the other side was still charging.Spend a few bucks on a better charger, stay away from Digital Concepts."
98,2,I listened to several non-earbud headphones from $10-$100 and these are the best between them. While I haven't listened to headphones over $100 I believe it would sound better than many of those too (possibly the best ever). Good clarity with good bass.Very good construction too. Can adjust to a lighter setting for more comfort.Only 1 minor issue. If the earpads aren't centered on your ear or if you have big ears then sometimes the edges of the pad can press uncomfortably on your ear (only felt if you leave them on a while). Probably KOSS should offer a larger size (keeping the speaker the same though) or make the original pads at the edges (outer radius) slightly concave away from the ear.
99,1,"Sounds great but little uncomfortable to use, little tight on ears(though my face is elliptical) not to say for broadfaces...you can feel the ear getting lightly heated after half an hour...."
100,0,"Straight-wired usb to psb doesn't always work, or works intermittenly. Be sure this is what you're after before you purchase it.Tried it with various PS-2 keyboards and USB jacks on the computer side...with limited success.Though it's only a few dollars, consider that basic USB devices (like logitech keyboards for example), are usually around $10.00 in 2010 dollars U.S.  Unless you got a special use, might not be worth the hassle."
101,2,"Comfortable, sturdy, & decent sound. I certainly would buy other Koss products & I rec'd this one for those of us who can't wear those uncomfortable ear buds."
102,0,These things are cheaply made and do not last long.  We bought two and have already thrown them away as they failed.
103,0,"I purchased this laptop cooler last year at a retail store, opting over models that cost $10 more.At first, this worked pretty well. All I needed was the edge to handle some light gaming that my laptop couldn't handle without additional cooling. It worked well in that regard.This cooler has a USB powercord, but the cord terminates as a DC jack to the back of the chillmat. While some people might consider this a plus, this is the single biggest failure on this item. The DC jack INPUT on the cooler itself was poorly constructed, causing the fans to spin up and down for a while until eventually, they wouldn't spin up at all. A laptop cooler that can't spin the fans is next to worthless.However, this cooler has no channels for air and doesn't sit high enough from the table to even add airflow when the fans are off. In a very real sense, this laptop cooler is actually WORSE than simply putting my laptop on top of a book for cooling benefits.I strongly recommend other people avoid this and find a better product."
104,0,"At first I was excited with my new rio mp3 player. I downloaded my favorite songs, upgrade the card, etc. but then I dropped my rio player. And that was the end of it. I called customer service and was sent from one person to the next to the next to the next, none spoke English. I finally found out their customer service phones are answered in a foreign country. Ok, I understand we all need jobs, especially the third world, BUT they don't understand me and can't help me. Then I finally get someone who says I must prove I purchased the rio player to get a customer authorization number to replay my rio because ""it can't be repaired and must be replaced."" I only dropped it once on my living room rug -- how weak is this device anyway! This happened 5 months ago, I've yet to receive my replacement. I've lost my money. Hold off and save for a better quality player and better customer service. I do not recommend any RIO products because of poor customer service (which you will eventually need)."
105,0,"The problem is with the drivers for the TU-S9.  They are the same drivers used in an older set of usb to serial converters written by Sabrent, with some minor tweaks for the newer operating systems.  Trenda has purchased the driver software from Sabrent.  Many negative reviews are the result of the weak drivers which result in the converter not working or not working properly.All the devices I use with my original USB 2.0 ports work (camera, gps's(2), mouse, keyboard, external hard drive); however, the Trenda TU-S9 converter will not work on the usb 2.0 ports.Before purchasing the Tenda, I installed a USB 3.0 card for the purpose of increasing the speed of the system drive backup (and restore) onto an external USB 3.0 hard drive; however, I discovered that although the external hard drive worked on the 3.0 port, it would not work in the boot up environment, so back to the USB 2.0 port it went.When the Trenda converter was connected to a usb 3.0 port, the drivers installed properly.  Since all of my devices work on all the 2.0 and 3.0 ports, except for the Trenda only on the 3.0 port, I concluded that this was a driver issue.If you encounter an installation issue and create a Ticket with Trenda, the technical response is to try it in another computer, and if it doesn't work, request a RMA.  Trenda is incapable of addressing the driver issue since it is a Sabrent product.  If you seek help from Sabrent, they can only offer the drivers given to Trenda, making this a hit or miss product.This product comes in a plastic encased tear proof packaging, so if you find yourself having a driver issue, you may not be able to return the product.I can give this product some positive since I did find a work-around, but give 2 stars because of the weak drivers.  Buyer beware."

107,1,"Extremely compact and easy to use, but may need something to stand on. This tripod is amazingly small, but probably won't work for every occasion. It is too short to stand by itself to be a real tripod, but if you can find an extra stand, such as a table or a tree post, then it works really good."

109,2,"I really like making photographs in low light, but I don't care for coarse grain or the 'bugs' artifacts created by using high ISO settings (above ISO 400) with digital cameras.  This is my one issue with my old Panasonic Lumix FZ50.  I had always used a cable release with film cameras, and finding an electric one for my Lumix and a subsequent Olympus E-510, I decided this was a must-have for my camera bag.I found the Canon Remote on Amazon to be about the best price.  Receiving the remote, I found it worked great, but I felt the 2-foot cable was a little short.  It's generally not too inconvenient and it does what I expect it to do, but another foot or so would be welcome (hey Canon, why not a full meter?).  I found a 6-foot, 3-conductor stereo extension at the local cables and connectors store, and now I can get as far back as I need to.  Now, if only I could rig a decent remote monitor...In short -- I love the product, but I would love it more if the cable was a little longer.--Perfesser"

114,2,THESE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT!  THE HAVE HIGH QUALITY SOUND AND WORKED GREAT FOR MY COMPUTERS EXTERNAL SPEAKERS.  I LOVE THE QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO MY CD'S
115,0,"After reading reviews about how great these clip-on headphones were, I was rather disappointed to find how uncomfortable and ill-fitting they are. I don't think my ears are any different from the average person, and these headphones just refused to fit properly or comfortably. Perhaps if they'd been bendable, they'd have been okay. As it was, however, the actual piece that I thought was supposed to fit into your ear ended up sitting right outside of it. It was more like having little tiny speakers sitting just behind the opening of my ears, as opposed to the way normal earbuds are supposed to fit. This caused the sound quality to deteriorate to a level similar to what you get when you hear music blaring out of normal headphones... when you don't actually have them on.Needless to say, I returned these and went with something else."
116,0,"The product has a very limited library and does not support most brands. Support on the website gets you no response (have sent 3 queries in the last 2 months and not one reply).The learning feature of the remote is extremely limited (it learns only about 15 buttons before memory is full), it is not even enough to program one remote (a TV remote has a minimum of 20 buttons this will learn only 15 across all devices). The remote works for only about 10 feet and if the base unit is behind a concrete wall it does not work (only works if there is a glass or wooden barrier)."
117,2,"After spending some time creating various playlists on Spotify, I quickly realized that listening to all those wonderful selections through my laptop speaker just didn't do justice to any of the songs.  Being on a tight budget, I researched various budget-priced Bluetooth speakers and bought the JBL Flip.  The difference between the laptop speaker and the Flip was, needless to say, outstanding.  So I started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that I could turn up the volume quite high on the Flip without experiencing any distortion.  Unfortunately, my wife wasn't as enthralled as I was with my late night listening habit.  I tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low, but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details I could hear at a higher volume.  Still being on a tight budget, I researched budget-priced headphones and bought the Koss PortaPros.  I can't believe how much better the music sounds on the PortaPro compared to the Flip.  All the raves you read from other reviewers are true, but can you see my dilemma?  The Flip sounds better than the laptop, and the PortaPros sounds better than the Flip.  I'm now thinking that I will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level.  For the time being, however, I'm extremely satisfied with the PortaPros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume I want without irritating my wife."
118,2,"These Koss portapros are the last headphones you will ever need (with a few exceptions). The lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase. The headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head. The metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it didn't receive 5 stars for comfort. This style of headphone by design doesn't have very good noise cancellation, which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments, but the portapros still do a decent job with the task. Sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price. These are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos. Highly recommended!"
119,2,I only recommend buying this if you have just one camera and one medium sized lens that you want to keep safe. I thought the case would be bigger but it is the perfect size when I take out the dividers. The only thing I can complain about is it's size.
120,2,Bought a new SLR camera without the rubber eyecup for eyeglass wearers. Price was reasonable for an OEM product. Now I can use the camera without scratching my AR coated lenses in my eyeglasses.
121,0,"The sound is okay, but I don't recommend this item for one simple reason: no power cord. It doesn't state (at least in the description above) that there's no power cord included with this unit. That costs extra time and hassle. There are a lot of units out there that do come with a power adaptor: buy one of those instead."
122,0,"This adapter is NOT for use with a radio! I live in a fairly strong signal area, and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out AM 800 (a 50kw station!), which is what I listen to most often!!"
123,1,"I purchased this without researching to thoroughly. Seems moot to review a product that's been discontinued but here goes. Works almost too well. Picks up my tiny terriers wrestling outside door. Also, note: requires 3 C batteries. Who uses C batteries nowadays? And one 9-volt battery--though it does have plug for convertor (not included). If you install good batteries, it will cost more for the batteries than the unit. 15 dollars for me to get it power. In fairness, you get what you pay for."
124,0,Bad sound quality.  Not adjustable.  Hearing static after bringing to the gym for 5 months.  Not worth it.
125,0,will not work with EyeTV that no doubt requires a more robust quality cabling to power the device.  This Cable would probably be ok if it didn't need to power something.
126,1,"My dad takes audio fidelity pretty seriously, and bought me these for me as a graduation present in 2004 since they fit well into a dorm room.  I have absolutely no complaints about the sound quality -- it's better than one would expect from such an inexpensive setup.However, in the past seven years two major problems have cropped up.  The first involved lots of cracking and popping in one speaker a few years back.  I don't remember exactly what happened, but I was able to fix it by disconnecting and doing some work inside of the control pod (I saw online that others had similar problems and was able to follow a standard fix).  In the last year, I have started having the same problem with the DIN connector for the control pod as everyone else, with the sound going in and out in one speaker unless the cord was fixed in exactly the right position.  I looked at it, and it seems that it's not a bad connection right near the plug in the cord (ie, the way headphone cords often fail right near the jacks) but rather that the plug-socket connection had too much play in it.  I opened up the subwoofer  to see if I could just hard-wire the control pod into it, but the area I would need to access is encased in epoxy.  Someone here suggested cannibalizing the PS/2 connection from an old keyboard, so I will probably try that, but it's looking like I probably need a new set of speakers."
127,0,"Normally I love Belkin products, but this one didn't measure up. After 2 weeks of usage it completely stopped working. I tried it in other outlets but no luck. It might have something to do with the ""switch"" thing that another review mentioned. I'm not too knowledgeable about outlets, but my other power surge protectors all work great. I recommend trying a different product."
128,2,"No surprises, it does exactly what it is supposed to do. A bit expensive (I guess one pays for the Canon Brand). I used to have the Opteka equivalent and found it less reliable.I really like the following points: solid build, nice design, the fact that it can be attached to the strap; the delay and immediate mode.I use it mostly for outdoor landscape photography and indoor studio portrait and no complaints. The only drawback is the fact that one needs to face the camera (OK from angle, but reduces the distance and definitely unusable from behind the camera, it is IR activated, not radio)."
129,0,"These didn't really stay in my ears that well. They were also quite cheaply made and the left one broke and wouldn't produce sound after a 6 months to a year. These headphones are quite an old model though, so I'm sure you'd be better off buying a newer model of Sony ear buds if you're interested in them. I use &#34;iLuv&#34; now and they have been thus far my favorite pair of I've ever owned."
130,0,"Just okay for the price. I have had some complaints from people saying they could not hear me. Very cheap, mostly plastic. Would have give it another star if it fold like my old one for storage. Will use until I can find something better."
131,0,"Was bought so that it didn't take up a pci slot.

132,2,"The product works: I have two pairs of 12 AWG speaker cables and a Cat 5 Ethernet cable running around five corners. It hides them well and the housing blends in nicelyTwo things you might want to look out for:(1) The adhesive -- VERY sticky.  A good thing. But if you set it in the wrong place, don't expect to be able to reset it without providing your own glue (and tidying up the mess it leaves behind the first time)(2) The ""joints"" work very well IF you don't set an edge of the housing flush against the skirting board/wall/ceiling: they need a little extra wiggle room and if you apply the housing too close, they won't click into place."

This is a terrible product, and I will never again purchase anything by Hawking Tech, especially with other companies that put out products that actually work!!  What makes my waste of time and resources even worse is that Amazon.com will charge me for the shipping.  Oh well, lessons learned."
137,1,"11-22-2002 : I've had my device for about 3 months. I experience random and exceptionally annoying lockups. The system just freezes in the midst of an audio program - requiring that I power down and power on the device. I believe there are better quality devices (name brands) available and I would recommend purchasing one of them rather than this unit. Long term I expect it to be unreliable (based on the increasing lockups that I am experiencing).The documentation on this is awful, but rather than repeat what others have said I'll say that (when it works without freezing) I am really enjoying this unit. It took me about 4 hours of experimenting to figure out how to efficiently record onto the device.The things I like:1. Able to use the device like another hard disk -- easy to copy, rename tracks right through explorer.2. Huge capacity to carry lots of recordings3. Simple drag and drop organization of directoriesThe things that I don't care for:1. Manual - unusable2. Software that comes with the unit deserves its own manual - took me three hours to figure out you can adjust options so that you save the track number as part of the file name -- avoiding the creation of playlists for audio recordings.Overall I recommend this if you are technically savvy -- I'd avoid it if you don't like to get your hands dirty exploring the nuances of gadgetry. I also question the long term integrity of the unit."
138,1,This product works fine and it does what it is suppose to do but I would have liked to have had the ability to set the sensitivity on it because of it being to sensitive. The alarm would go off all the time for no apparent reason or because of the wind blowing something in front of it. I would end up having a lot of false alarms and so I stopped using it.

Why?  Because I knew someone who in retail (not a box store) I could buy it from at true wholesale prices and it was insanely dirt cheap.  Could I tell the difference when I switched speaker wires?  Of course not.  However, when I upgraded to a very high end receiver and 4 high-end massive tower speakers with a high-end giant center speaker plus two rear speakers then I (and my neighbors) noticed a huge difference.Monster products are ""faith"" based.  You want to believe that they are better with absolutely no empirical evidence whatsoever because you need to reinforce your purchase decision.I know that those of you who already bought Monster products are insecure and will mark this review as 'not helpful'.  I take comfort from that.For those who haven't yet bought the massively advertised Monster products, I encourage you to look around before making a purchase and realize that a speaker wire won't make your sound system instantly sound great or even better.  No speaker wires regardless of cost or perceived quality will compensate for mediocre speakers or an old or inadequate receiver.To further complicate the issue, in order to truly judge the quality of the sound you need to have a source of high quality sound output. I primarily listen to recent Blu-Ray movies with uncompressed sound (the difference is massive).  Go to blu-ray dot com to obtain the A/V ratings of movies.  If you're listening to movies with poor quality sound, no matter how good your equipment is, all you're going hear is junk.To give you an example how your own mind plays games with you, here's my own recent experience:  On my new Blu-Ray player I came across an audio option that was set for the default. I increased it to the max since my receiver is capable of handling the load.  When I restarted the disk, the audio sounded remarkably better.  I was impressed by this new setting and greatly enjoyed listening to the new enhanced audio output that night.The next day, however, I read the Blu-Ray manual and discovered that this audio option didn't work with HDMI which is what I have.  I had totally deceived myself into believing that the sound had dramatically improved all because I wanted to believe this to be the case.Imagine the influence advertising can have upon you."

143,2,"I'm giving this bag a 4 star... but only because it's almost too tight for aCanon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)with aCanon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Camerasimage stabilized lens (and that's without its lens shade).You can get your 60D with 24-105mm f/4 L IS lens into this bag.  Remove the LHS velcro side cushion & re-mount it on the bottom RHS of the bag, then position the camera in the bag oriented ""portrait mode"" (side with shutter button oriented up).Overall, the bag is sturdy yet light, and has enough compartments for the 60D charger & a few filters."
144,2,"I purchased these portable headphones based on information in a review by an Amazon customer.  They are great.  I replaced the earphones I received with my Zen Nano and I am so pleased. These are really superior to what came with my Zen Nano. They block out most of the outside sound and my CD recordings sound super.Since I go to the gym every day, I love the fact that these ""stay put"" and allow me to do my daily routine.  They can pretty much be molded by squeezing the eartips themselves and letting them expand when you put them in your ear.I would absolutely buy another set of Koss Plugs.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>UPDATE-January 2009-These portable headphones are still going strong and I use them 5 days a week at the gym.  I am so pleased, that when the time comes, I will definitely purchase Koss again."
145,2,"I jog alot so I previously purchased the TDK Mojo (since it claimed to have an 8 minute buffer), thinking that it's anti-skip feature would be perfect.  Well it wasen't.  After approximately 2 minutes it would just skip or even stop completely.  A friend of mine recently purchased an AVC Soul MP3 Player for jogging, and that one also skipped!! I began to wonder if there was actually a CD/MP3 player that didn't skip.  I then skeptically purchased the Philips Expanium.  I took it jogging and to my suprise, this unit did NOT skip at all!!  (I used a MP3 disc...not sure how it does on CD's).  Now I know this player lacks a couple of features, such as Id3 tags, and a backlit screen....big deal/so what?  The only real drawback was that the volumes level was not high enough for me, but I tend to like my music on the loud side anyway.  (I just ended up buying a boosteroo to take care of the volume issue).  The sound is exellent and that's important.  I am very pleased with this unit."
146,2,I have Bose acoustic noise cancelling headphones which i paid $150 while this Koss Headphones I paid $25 ( black friday deal ). I can say I love this headphone way more than Bose. 100% recommended.
147,1,Mouse is OK but retractable mechanism broke after 6 months.
148,2,"These do their job well, and are priced right.  Make sure you are getting the size you really need/want, it really matters !"
149,2,"As I'm not a heavy user at this point, I can't comment on its durability over time.  Other reviewers have raised legitimate concerns about the handle putting strain on the main zipper compartment, since there is no attachment from the main handle to the body of the back to help distribute weight.  I can see the strain breaking down the material over time.  Also, I verified as one reviewer stated that Canon provides no product warranty with their bags.  Those misgivings aside, however, I like how my items fit comfortably in this bag.  It's small enough to be very portable, yet gives you enough space to fit quite a bit of equipment. While the overall dimensions are smaller, the space allotted for each lens is larger than say, the Tamrac 8, for example.  A quick aside on bag specs: it seems many manufacturers inflate the number of bodies and lenses that can be carried inside.  Perhaps they're all using 50mm primes and entry level dslr's to arrive at those numbers.  In this bag, I fit a pro dslr without a lens attached, a flash beneath it, 2 wide angle lenses (roughly 16-35mm), a standard prime, a nifty 50mm, and a second flash.  Another note on these bags: where do you put the filter hoods? I have mine resting on top of the dividers, but none of the bags I've seen allows the type of filters that go with wide angle lenses. I digress-- the side pockets work great for stashing batteries, stray cords, and filters.  It's been put through the paces only a couple of times, so continued use will give me more information about it's reliability and resistance to the elements."
150,2,"It works as advertised. I use it for macro work. While it reduces camera jitter well, it's not an electronic remote.  It is a good buy for the money."
151,0,"I live about 30 miles away from NYC and use OTA broadcast. I have a big antenna in my attic for the last 20 years. Anyway, I was planning to move my TV to the other side of the room and needed a long cable. So I connect this cable from the splitter to a 36db amplifier. Before, I had 41 digital channels. After I put this cable in, I now have 24 digital channels. From the antenna plus this 50 feet cable, there is 75 feet of cable. With my original cable from the splitter to the amplifier, it was 6 feet long, a total of 31 feet of cable. I don't know if its the cable or maybe I need something stronger to boost the TV signals. So I guess I can't rearrange my room for now until I figure what to do."

153,0,"It was supposed to record for 3 minutes, but it didn't even record for 3 seconds.  All the card was designed, was to sell you more software (if you want to record for more than 3 seconds).  I am a victim of their scam."
154,2,"I have both the Koss Protapro and Sennheiser PX100 headphones. I love them both! I just bought the Portapros brand new. My PX100 is 5 years old and the mechanicals are wearing out. Here's a comparison between the two.The mechanicals on the PX100 are a notch better than the Portapros. The PX100 has headband padding; the Portapros do not and take a few hairs out now and then. Once placed on your head, both are comfortable. The PX100 folds up neater than the Portapros. The PX100 design is sleeker, more modern and less prominent on your head. The over all construction seems a notch better on the PX100. Here's the interesting thing though. Both are open air but the Portapros seem to seal out external sounds a little better than the PX100. I cannot explain why. The Portapros are also slightly more efficient and play a bit louder.The Sound character of each is a matter of taste. Both headphones sound excellent. Both are sweet, clean and very detailed. Both are non-fatiguing. The Protapros are a bit bass heavy. On some music that bassy sound is magnificent. On other types of music with already prominent bass the PX100 is preferable. Surprisingly, the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones. The Portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the PX100.  The PX100 may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the Portapros.The PX100 is an up-to-date modern design. The Portapros are classics with a design that goes back 15 years! The original PX100 came with a nice case. The Portapros have a hook and eyelet at the bottom of the metal headband. They hook together to bind them tight to fit inside a small bag. I use neither the bag nor the case. You may want to buy both. You can't go wrong with either."
155,2,"this is a perfectly designed case for the etrex legend.  Joystick is easily accessible, it fits snug, and the belt clip is nice and secure.  My only complaint is the plastic window to protect the LCD.  It's pretty thick and seems like it scratches pretty easily and makes the LCD more difficult to read with the heavy glare.  Otherwise, it's a good thing to have to protect your GPS from invetible drops and abrasion."
156,0,"From the reviews, it looks like MAC users have better luck with this than Windows users. I tried to install on Windows XP and it never worked. Just say no."
157,0,"First, you won't get 12 screen protectors.  You will get three lousy screen protectors, that, if your screen is REALLY small (about 2""), will be cut into small pieces that may give 12 screen protectors.  They come off really easy, they are exactly as the screen protectors that came attached to your cell phone screen, or your wrist watch, or whatever needs some protection, but no, they are definitely not permanent.  For the price I can give'em two starts, but I would strongly recommend Fellowes screen protectors over these."
158,2,"I looked at literally dozens of possible bags and finally settled on this one because of a special need. I don't have a lot of camera equipment but what I do have is somewhat unusual. I needed a bag to carry a recently acquired Fuji GSW690 III medium-format camera, along with my Rollei QZ35W rangefinder, and a few miscellaneous extras, such as a Pentax spotmeter for the Fuji, extra 35 mm and 120 mm film, my little Fuji Tiara APS point and shoot camera, extra batteries, and so on. This is every piece of camera equipment that I own, but it fits nicely inside this small backpack-style bag.The Fuji is a fairly large camera, although it isn't that heavy, since it's mostly polycarbamate plastic. But it's all-manual--it doesn't even have an internal light meter--hence the need for a spotmeter. This odd assemblage makes for an awkward arrangement in most camera bags, but the backpack format works great. After rearranging the internal dividers I had something that fit perfectly and wasn't that bulky. The only complaint I have is that the backstraps aren't detachable, but this isn't a big deal. All-in all an excellent choice for someone who needs to do some customizing on the bag interior to suit a special need."
159,0,I actually really loved this little cam when I first got my hands on it.  The thing I really liked was the ability to swivel the lens around separate from the tape transport where you actually hold the camera which made it much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time.  Problem isnot long after I had been using the camera and loving it I started to get the dreaded DEW message and the camera would shut right down.  Only way to get it going again was to remove the battery pack and the lithium backup battery as well.  Then you would have to reset the time and date.  This little tricked worked as a fix for a while and then eventually that no longer worked so I needed to find another fix.  Thankfully you can find just about anything on the internet and someone posted that the problem was with a defective solder joint on the DEW sensor and a fix could be achieved by hitting the cold solder joints with a soldering iron quickly just to re-melt them.  This also worked for a while and then it did not and I eventually shelved the camera.
160,0,"I had always thought that Monster's THX cables were the way to go, since the technical specs were better then generic cables, but I was wrong. I have 3 pairs of these THX cables, and ever pair has some hiss and mild noise that I can hear in the background. I believe these are only single shielded, so that could be a problem. I also have the optical THX cable, and that does the same thing. The only pair that doesnt hiss, is the higher end Monsters that I bought, which I beleive at the time were the Monster 3's. NOW, I am not telling you to go out and pay 80bucks for a cable. That is a huge waste of money...In fact, I discovered Monoprice, which has much better prices then Monster, and I believe better cables. Blue Jean is also good, but they are still a bit pricey. Hands down, unless you are paying top dollar for monsters Highest end cables, you are getting only a slightly better cable then a generic. Go with monoprice, or try Belkin, as Belkin used Double Shielding, and Monoprice makes some cables with Triple Shielding"
161,2,"Just bought these - they isolate sound, have very good high-end, are comfortable and stay in my ear (most ear buds fall out). I also bought a pair of the Coby CVE92 ear buds because I thought they'd fit as well. Sure enough they do, but they sound terrible in comparison. In addition, these have a lifetime ""no questions asked"" warranty - that's gold, my friend."
162,2,"The original foam cusion is not very comfortable. There is an excellent article on[...] which describe a simple mod to make it an excellent sound isolating in-ear monitor. Based on your listening preference, you may decrease the bass or mid level damping. The mod will make it a poor man's Shure."
163,2,"I do a lot of work on my computer. I do graphic design as well as network administration and various other things. I have had issues with carpal tunnel type issues on standard mice. This mouse is the best thing I have ever found. I have used mine for 3+ years. It is comfortable, easy, smooth, and accurate. Once you are used to not moving your hand, it is a breeze and is crucially useful in dual monitor set ups (trying moving your hand on a standard mouse across two screens without picking it up).Last year I got a Macbook Pro and have been using a mighty mouse and although for a mouse it is good, it is painfully obvious that I miss my trackman when using it. It is so apparent that I just bought a cordless version for that laptop specifically. It is a large body mouse as some have noted, which can be annoying physically, but it is so good at what it does I don't notice. It is great ergonomically and I have not had one pain since using it."
164,0,I wish I had just bought a regular fax machine. The documentation for using this product is pathetic. I am an experienced computer user and it took me a couple hours to figure it all out. I finally discovered that I can't send more than one file with the software that comes with this thing (my scanner creates a separate file for each page). I ended up using the Windows Fax Manager application (Win 7 OS) with the TrendMicro hardware because that software allows me to combine files.
165,0,"The cable looks good, but did not work.  The cable got EXTREMELY hot, and did not even recognize my devices.  I switched the cable with another brand, and everything worked.Be careful when using."
166,0,"Something is wrong&#8230; I have this same exact model at home and love it. I bought it a few years ago at my local camera store. I purchased this one for my vacation house so I wouldn&#8217;t have to bring it back and forth. It is nothing at all like the one I bought a few years ago! The bubble was broken off when I got it but the box was not damaged at all. I didn&#8217;t even notice the bubble was broken at first. I set my camera up on it and tried the different functions. It was jerky and not at all smooth when panning. I couldn&#8217;t find the bubble to see if it was level, I thought they moved it but it was nowhere. I looked in the bottom of the plastic bag and there it was. At first I thought I just had to snap it into place&#8230;. wrong. It had broken off completely. I can only guess that this tripod isn&#8217;t being made where or how it was before. Don&#8217;t waste your money!"
167,2,"This is the wireless version of the legendary Logitech Track Wheel we love, but I should have paid more attention to the comments in the reviews about the limited range.If I have the receiver even 3 feet away the response suffers.  I have placed the receiver right under my monitor about a foot away.  I guess it is better than the wired trackman where I was always hassling with the cord getting in the way.When you have the pair close enough it works as well as a wired Trackman Wheel, and that is the pretty much perfect pointing device, deserving of its reputation and cult status.Setting it up was harder than you'd think. You can't get the user manual - even from Logitech - but I guessed that once you put a AA battery in the trackball, you use a pin or pen to push the recessed button on the underside of the trackball and press the Connect button on the receiver.  It took several tries for me to get it working on my Mac. It only worked when the receiver was plugged in directly to the USB port and not through a USB hub.Bottom line:  The Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel works as well as the wired Trackman Wheel, but you you're only eliminating the first foot or so of cord.I'd likely get another one of these in the future. I have the Bluetooth M570 and didn't like the response of that.  *sigh*"
168,0,"I thought I'd get these guys to see what all the hubub was about, but found myself disappointing. I felt silly after buying them because I didn't notice a difference in quality.Pros: It works?Cons: They are so bulky and thick that my TV mounted on the wall will not angle down enough because they stick out of the back so far. You need a solid few inches of clearance from the plug. This is a problem if you need to have it close to the wall or need to loop them up from the bottom. Big issue for no gain and higher price. This bulk is completely unnecessary."
169,2,I have owned a pair of Koss Porta-Pros back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones. I have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce. I will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production. They are that good.
170,2,"I used to be a huge fan of MS Intellimouse (the old fashioned 2 button with wheel/button).This feels just as good, despite the fact that it doesnt look as ergonomic.The price is very reasonable.The wheel is MUCH more reliable than MSIntellimouse. It's faster and doesn't wear as quickly (I play a lot of video games and surf the net a lot -- that requires a lot of scrolling!)I've never had to clean it -- not once!And you gotta admit, that's one nice shade of blue! Very attractive.Standard USB connection with an adapter to fit into PS2.Note: Just because it's optical and you can pretty easily use it on any surface (i.e. your desk, a text book, or your knee) that doesn't mean you should. It picks up imperfections in the surface too...its better to use a mousepad, regardless of how crappy. I find it works best with the soft cloth top, not the plasticy ones."
171,2,"Sure these headphones look a bit wierd. A matter of taste at best.However the sound is great! Whether the source is a smartphone, tablet or PC this is an excellent sounding headphone for the price."
172,0,"My husband has had a pair of these for many years and really likes them so I ordered a pair to use with my iPad for use on airplane trips. I think the quality has deteriorated since my husband's purchase, but they are adequate. I forgot to take into account the noise volume of the jet engines when flying so I had to have the volume on max to hear. These are okay for listening to speech (as opposed to music) in a quiet environment. They feel flimsy. They are not especially comfortable, although I wore them continuously for 4-5 hours on a couple of cross country flights. I definitely will upgrade before I fly again."
173,1,"They look ok is about the only good thing I can say. Very poor, weak design. For Bose owners these are a rip-off. Bose was so intent that these stands only work with there one little speaker they broke every good design practice by using very small mounting screws with practically no edge distance. So if your speaker ever turns over with Bose little boxes on it you can expect a broker unrepairable stand. Being a design engineer I was able to foil there efforts by carefully oversizing the holes to take a normal screw and adding a second screw into my speaker case at the bottom. It looks great with my Gigaworks THX speakers and is much stronger than what Bose intended. Bose only provided the one undersized screw and a tiny plastic nub at the bottom which is supposed to barely hole the speaker straight. My speakers are now mounted much stronger than Bose's weak engineering and look a sound a lot better. I will be adding pictures of these.IMPORTANT NOTE: these speaker stands are advertised as 'universal' when in fact they are not. They are designed to only work with one Bose speaker, the small cube. I would have rated as one star but since I was able to mount my speaker even better than they intended, I will give them 2 stars for their failed effort a bad engineering."

175,0,"So, these are supposed to work in stand alone CD recorders?  Not quite.  When the CD's arrived. half of the CD's I tried in my recorder weren't recognized (no OPC) and those that did, I had to put in my machine more than once in order for my machine to recognize the OPC code, so I could record on the disc.  Hmm, not exactly what I was looking for, so they are going back.  Guess I should have stuck with Maxell.  I'll be correcting that mistake as I return these discs."
176,2,The used materials is durable and workmanship is good. The design & dimension is practical. The provided padding & partition is sufficient.
177,2,Works great with my Rebel XT. Being able to shoot remotely lets me take pictures of myself nekked with great ease! *HIGH-FIVE*
178,2,"These are the best pair of headphones I've ever used.  I only had to buy this pair because I somehow broke my last pair (had for over 2 years).  The breaking was all my fault; nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car.  Mea culpa!  Seriously though, the audio is the best I've ever heard from non-noise canceling headphones.  I use these on walks and jogs, so I need something that doesn't completely drown out ambient noise.  They do drown out softer noises (much more than earbuds) so be careful!"
179,2,Works only when pointed directly at the front of the camera. Otherwise...a great product. A must if you do not have a IS lens and want to shoot at higher focal lengths.
180,0,"I bought these because I've had very good experiences with this style of headphones in the past. However, these headphones are very difficult to wear and will not stay on my ears no matter how I position them. I even have problems with them falling out when I'm just sitting at my desk. My intent was to use these headphones when I go walking or running, but there's no way they can work for that because they keep falling out!"
181,2,"Unbeliveable (until you hear them) quality for the price!I'm a musician but not much of an audiophile, tho I'd wager my hearing is slightly above average.  The amount of richness (esp base) was surprising - i couldn't believe my laptop (usually very sub-par sound) and Rio Karma (as compared to the Sennheiser MX300 earbuds) could output such quality tones.  My brother recommended these (he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me), as he uses these during his commute instead of his Grado SR 125's which were getting beat up and aren't nearly as comfortable as the Koss PortaPros.  Though obviously not anywhere as 'elite' as Grados or Beyers, I find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his Grado's. Additionally, the tension adjustment is a really nice feature, and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses.  Additionally, they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accents."
182,0,"I have had these speakers for a little over a year. They are the worst set of computer speakers I have ever owned period.First impressions where that they had really tinny, thin sound to them. Like louder laptop speakers... Not good at all.Maximum volume is also not very high and they start cracking at anything above half volume.Now after a year something has failed so that only one of the speakers works...You get what you pay for but there are better cheap computer speakers out there for the same or lower price.DO NOT BUY!!!"
183,0,"Just as another reviewer mentioned, the left earbud had come apart inside the package. Looking carefully, I could see where the package had been pinched or crushed before shipping. I tried them anyway hoping that if I snapped it back together it would be OK but there was static so back they went. Disappointing because had they not been broken, I believe they would have sounded fine. They certainly were comfortable and the price was right."
184,1,"I purchased some 16 gauge speaker early this spring from Best Buy, and the size of the wire was visibly thicker than this. For my application, front and rear speakers in my car, this wire will do just fine. I will, however use different wire for my sub-woofer. On the plus side lots of wire at a very good price. When you shop online once in a while you don't get what you expected. I was disappointed -2 stars. I do like to shop Amazon!"
185,0,"The charging ports stopped working completely about 6 months after receiving back in December of last year...really upset that I have to deal with shipping and the fact that the email link on D-Link's website for tech support doesn't work, plus now I'd rather have a USB 3.0 hub and I won't be buying a D-Link."
186,2,Just as advertised. Arrived quickly.  Seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a veryold VCR with many hours use.
187,1,This product really doesn't perform as well as I had expected.Limited range and functionality.  We're disappointed.
188,0,"This is a very well constructed cable, and is probably one of the best mini-to-RCA Y cables.  However, I have found the sound from the iPod to the receiver/amplifier to be VERY low; much much lower than the signal from a CD player (1/5 of the CD output loudness).  This forces you to turn the sound level way up, both on the iPod and on the receiver/amplifier, consuming lots of battery power on the iPod.  If you have a low power receiver/amplifier, you may not be able to play it loud enough.  The sound quality is adequate, but not great, as one can expect for this type of Y cable, regardless of build quality.  I also purched the NYCO iPod Stereo Link for comparison, and the sound quality is much better with a much louder output volume (3x louder than the Monster mini-to-RCA cable).  The NYCO is also more power efficient as it drains much less power from the iPod.  It does not go through the mini-jack, and also bypasses the volume control (a good sign if you care about sound quality).If you don't need to recharge your iPod while you play though the cable to a receiver/amplifier, I would definitely go with the NYCO Stereo Link Cable.  I am an audiophile enthusiast, with quite a bit of experience in high-end audio."
189,0,"...I purchased this mouse after reading the many positive reviews. But its performance is very disappointing. It won't move the cursor to where I want it to be and it's very frastrating sometimes. It is lot worse than my old microsoft wheelmouse. This is my second bad experience with optical mouse. The extra functions with this mouse like navigating are nice, but I seldom use them since a lot of browsers now provide mouse gestures that are more convinient than using the mouse."
190,0,"I have had this camera for almost two years now...just after the one-year mark (when warranty expired!) it started having problems.  Before then it was great.  Small, nice LCD, strong zoom, easy to use, nice video.  I never tried it for digital snapshots, though.Problems started at the worst possible time...trip to Brazil half for vacation and half to document my wife philanthropic work that she is doing (and starting a nonprofit org).  For no apparent reason, as we were in a drought, the ""DEW"" warning kept going off and not allowing any use of camera.  After days of frustration, we just gave up on it.Back in the states, weeks later the DEW problem seemed to have gone away but then the camera started eating the video-tape!!So, I bought a new tape....and, guess, what?  The ""DEW"" indicator goes off again -- at my kids TaeKwonDo testing for Black Belt!Ironic how you save a couple bucks shopping around for a value product and then realize you have lost priceless memories due to poor engineering/manufacturing....I am now using our 10-year old Sony videotape camcorder...big but RELIABLE.I'm going to try soldering the DEW problem per other review...pathetic that consumers are soldering Japanese camcorders!update:  GUESS WHAT?  I called Sharp USA and complained to Tech Support and they transferred me to Customer Service who knew immediately about this issue and they told me to send it in to the repair facility and they would issue a special approval for a free repair even though i have owned it beyond the 1-year warrany period...they said they'd pay for labor & materials,..i only have to pay for shipping.  I am satisfied."
191,2,"Above average camera. Overall, a good starter digital camera. The pictures are great, with color reproduction being its greatest strength. In addition, as many reviewers attest to, this camera is easy to set-up and use right out of the box. No problems with the software installation, although I quickly uninstalled the included Arcsoft PhotoImpression. Quirky interface and useability issues. The LCD is more than adequate, and unlike some reviewers, I actually had no issues with battery life. I got 40+ pics from the included alkalines and have been using rechargeables since then with well over 100 pics before recharge. Pretty much what I expected from a digital camera. The menu system is easy to navigate, but some settings that I use more often, such as resolution and compression, should have quick buttons on the camera to make switching back and forth easier.My biggest complaint is with the zoom. I knew what I was getting with the 2x zoom, and it has been a limitation at times. Wish it was a true 3x or greater mechanical zoom. In addition, the zoom settings are not variable like a true SLR. Also, as I get more used to the camera, I wish I had greater control over more manual settings.Thus my overall conclusion is that this is a good &quot;starter&quot; digital camera, although one could argue that $399 is a little pricey for your first digitial camera. What makes the price more justifiable to me was the quality of the highest resolution pictures. They are great, leaving only some camera features as limitations.Pros: Great color reproduction. High resolution pictures are excellent. Easy to set-up and use out of the box.Cons: Limited mechanical zoom (2x). Limited manual adjustments."
192,1,"I bought this item twice.The First time, Fall 2011.Now That was a Great item. i used it as a Cat doorbell. it worked great.5 STARS.Unfortunately, i never protected the sensor from the elements.So, two years later, it finally dies. the sensor would beep/chime All day for NO reason.No problem. i will buy it again (and be for careful).The Second unit was identical to the 1st, but the packaging was Updated.Instead of coming in a Box, it came in that hard-to-open-HARD-PLASTIC crap we all hate.It also had a label on it &#34;As Seen on TV&#34;.Performance: CRAP.it would do the random/constant chiming slash beeping.VERY Annoying. I threw it out in 5 days.1 STAR!No LONGER recommended."
193,0,"For $100 more, buy the 28-105mm 3.5-4.5 version.  results are far better.  This lens (4-5.6) is not quite there. don't even buy it."
194,1,"I thought these would be lightweight. I like the item, but prefer headphones to have a light band around the head.  I was not that happy with it.  I compared it to my old set, and saw a noticable difference."
195,0,"Do yourself a favor and limit your camera search to those that use the industry standard memory format, COMPACT FLASH."
196,2,"I have been a Portapro enthusiast for the past 4+ years. You've already read the hundreds rave reviews of the Portapro's phenomenal sound and being that I am in agreement with them all, I have little to add. I have several head phones from different manufacturers such as AKG, Sony, and Sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones I have. The only headphones that are better are in-ear variety which I use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym.However, recently I have fallen out of love with my Portapros and I think there are a lot of Portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that I'm about to elaborate on. First of all, let me explain that I have several mp3 players. Recently, I acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory (16gb). Because of the long battery life inherent in these players (25 to 30 hours), I'm pretty much listening to them all day long, along with my Portapros. I wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because I need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them.With my extended hours of usage, I've been noticing that when I remove my Portapros, about 7 times out of 10 they pull at least one of my hairs out. I have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this. This acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism. However, because many times, I have to answer the phone quickly, I find myself having to pull off the Portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal.Because of the great sound of the Portapro, I have been will to put up with it...until last night.Last night I was at Office Depot and on a whim I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds (with the wind-up case) for about 10 bucks. These are the most generic basic earbuds that Sony makes. Over the years, I have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entry-level headphones with entry-level sound. But when I plugged them in, I was in for a pleasant shock. These sounded great. They must of done some design improvements since I last tried them. Excellent full spectrum sound for metal, jazz, classical -- everything I listen to. Tight, natural bass response that, in my opinion, is at least 97% of the greatness of the Portapro -- all for a measly 10 bucks. Better sounding than the other headphones I have that cost several times as much.Long story short...I've switched to Sony Fontopia's for the time being. The fact that they're not ""in the ear"" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people. But best of all -- no hair pulling.I still like the Portapros for their sound. In fact a week ago, I wrote an email to Koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn't compromise the positive qualities of the current design.That's cool. I'll be waiting. For now, I've hung up my Portapros. If there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like I did, the Sony Fontopia are a nice alternative for the being.Revision 2/28/2011In recent months, I've migrated back to using my Portapros. I'm just more careful when I take them off. There's nothing else like the sound on these babies. While I hope you guys fix the hair pulling, you're back to 5 stars."
197,2,"The Sony digital camcorder records excellant video images and sound, but most TV set fail to reproduce the image quality and conventional VHS recorders lose the video quality when copying.  The still image quality is poor compared to stand alone 1 mega pixel cameras and cannot be used at the same time you are video taping.Works well with a iMac and iMovie for editing, could not see doing it any other way for less.  Some Sony home PCs also allow for editing using the same firewire interface with the Sony camcorder.Recommendation:  If you want super high qulaity video images and want the small size get this camcorder...But don't get it because it has a still image capability, instead get a nice digital still camera for that function.A side note: if you use a IR filter on this Sony and use the night shot mode you can view and record in infared.  Cool for experimental video effects and can be done likewise with most digital cameras I am told."
198,0,"Got this item thru Staples--at a substantially higher price than Amazon. What a waste! This item was DOA.It SHUT DOWN MY LAPTOP INSTANTLY. Dead. Kaput. Gone. The chill pad's fan never worked--AND it shut down EVERYTHING on my laptop--no response at all. Wouldn't even go thru the startup sequence. Once the ""kill pad"" was unplugged from my laptop, the computer returned to life, with the help of a complete restore cycle. I could not return it fast enough.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. BAD CHOICE AND A COMPUTING HAZARD. MAY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER. I learned this the hard way :("
199,0,Had trouble with it connecting the ps3 just wouldn't work so I brought the cheaper version by treadnet and it works great. Why spend more for a name and less ports.
200,2,"I bought these headphones a few years ago, after reading all the glowing reviews on Amazon, and I'm so glad I did.  I'm pretty rough with my headphones, and these things can take a beating.  I ended up replacing a pair after 2 years, which is unbelievable in itself, because I usually go through a pair of headphones every six months.  And it wasn't because they didn't work, it's just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed.  Here are all the pros:Value:  They are a great value for the money.  I've had more expensive headphones that didn't sound as good.  Even if you don't want to spend thirty-something dollars for headphones and don't care what they sound like, I still think it would be worth it, because you won't have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them.  These headphones are very durable and aren't made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are, so in the long run, they would be worth it.Comfort:  These are very comfortable.  There are 2 settings, tight and loose, to adjust for different head sizes.  I've never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears, or whatnot.  These fit very comfortably on my head (I have a big head btw) and I've never had a problem with them sliding off.Portability:  These aren't the smallest earphones in the world, but certainly not the biggest.  They do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in.  I bring them along on trips on all the time and I've never had a problem with them.Sound Quality:  They sound fantastic!  Better than a lot of more expensive headphones.  Though any headphone with the Koss name sounds great, I think these are the best.  Just the right amount of bass and treble.  Doesn't sound tinny, or like you're playing music in a tunnel.  If you're used to less expensive headphones, you're going to hear stuff in your music you never heard before.Ease of Use:  Well, most headphones aren't hard to use, and these are the same.  The only drawbacks to these is I found it hard to adjust to loose/tight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up (which is why I never fold them up).  I've owned foldable headphones that were much worse though.Build:  Awesome!  The headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable.  Not long ago, I accidently broke off one of the earpieces.  Guess what, it pops right back in!  Five stars for build!I've never buy another pair of headphones, ever.  I bought 3 pairs of these, (One for home, one for the gym, and one to replace the ones from home) and I plan to buy more in the future, if need be.  I love love love these headphones.The only slight con I can think of is they aren't 'sleek' looking like other headphones, in fact they look like they came straight out of 1982.  I don't really care what they look like though, and quality of these headphones more than make up for the ugliness."
201,0,"My order was cancelled after I was told it was shipped.  I received a full refund, but I needed the switch not the money.  I am still looking for another provider.However this is a great product, I use one at my office."
202,2,"This product works great to organize and hide the cords coming from your tv.  I would definitely recommend painting them the color of your wall so that it blends in and isn't noticeable.  If you the actual electrical plug running from your television is too short to reach your outlet, you will have to figure out another solution because the casing is too small to house the plug or extension cord ending. After installation, I had plenty of casing left to use on another project."
203,1,"Noisy? Only on rewind or fast forward.Eats tapes? Hardly.Bad recording? Not from what I can see.This was a better machine than the JVC I've reported on. I couldn't get this machine to automatically program the clock for me, but it did fine with the cable channels and programming the clock is pretty easy.Overall, this is a very easy machine to use. It's my third Panasonic VCR I've owned. In fact, it's the third VCR I've ever owned, my first two being Panasonics as well. My first lasted 20 years, the second 10 years. Hopefully, this one will last as long if not longer than the previous ones.Unlike the JVC and many other VCRs I looked at, this one does NOT require you to hit a TIMER button in order for it to go into standby recording mode. Just program what you want to record (whether it's one time, daily or weekly), hit the power button and your done. You have up to 8 slots to program, which is nice and seems to be the standard these days. My previous Panasonic only had 2 slots, so this is a VAST improvement for me.The remote can program various name brand TVs unlike the JVC remote, which ONLY worked with JVC TVs. Also, I was able to get this machine into my universal remote whereas with the JVC, I couldn't.Picture playback is pretty clear and the colors look fine, whether on a pre-recorded movie or from a recording I did from the TV.No tapes have been eaten and playback from the machine is NOT noisy at all. I guess those other people have VERY sensitive hearing or else, they bought a bad machine.Featurewise, it's pretty standard. My only gripe with this machine (and the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of possibly 4) is that I have experienced a problem that others have stated in that it rejects tapes sometimes. You'll put in a tape sometimes and then it spits it out. After another try or two, it generally takes it. The only thing I can fathom is that the spindles on the machine are not sensing the spindles on the tape correctly, so it assumes it's not seating correctly and spits it out. Either shaking the tape or just trying it another time or two has worked for me and I have experienced this with my other two machines once in awhile, but not to the degree that I experience with this machine. But, that is a MINOR factor for my wife, who  is the main user of this machine.Overall, this is a pretty good machine and I've had pretty good experiences with Panasonic in the past, which is why I finally came back to this one."
204,2,"The back is light weight, nicely padded throughout to protect your lens and camera.  I like the pouch in the front portion of the back, good space for the battery charger and cable.  When you open the main compartment, you will find a zippered pouch for small items such as your lightning bolt connector for your IPAD to transfer pics from your media card along with other small items you may choose to carry.It is easy to clean when it gets dusty from being out hiking.  The dividers are nicely padded, although somewhat frustrating to remove and move to change the compartment sizes. However, not a reason at all to avoid this bag.My only reason for not giving this bag 5 stars is that the strap is a little short for a big person as myself. I wish the strap was longer to accommodate a better hang from my shoulder.  The solution I found is to replace the strap that come with the bag with another strap I borrowed from my laptop/office messenger bag.Great price for an Very Nice bag.  I would not hesitate to recommend."
205,0,"I ordered a SanDisk Flash Card & received a brand that would not work in my embroidery machine.  I store all of my embroidery designs on flash cards & the computer in my machine only excepts certain brands of flash cards.  I can only store 100 designs on each card because that's all that my machine will recognize.  When I order SanDisk in the future, this is what I want."
206,2,"these headphones to me are my favorite, after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear. they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass. plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones, this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged."
207,2,"I bought a pair of these while I was in New York - I bought them from one of the big camera/gear brokers there and paid about $35 for them. I bought them because my IEMs are too dangerous to wear on city streets and my AKG K271s are too big to wear out. So, these seemed like a happy medium. They're very durable, they have excellent bass for something this size, and they have a cool retro look. With the lifetime guarantee I'm comforted in the idea of getting them replaced if I should accidentally break them. So far so good though, 6+ months later."
208,2,"A good product, works well in the canon, very useful for pictures of precision. It would be better if he had the longer cable"
209,0,"I bought four of these, all at the same time and all from the same vendor.  Perhaps it's a lot problem, but they are all junk.  They are constantly dropping connection and I have to unplug the hub and plug it back in to get the devices that are plugged into it to be recognized again.  I've used these hubs on XP, XP 64-bit, and Vista and they drop connections on all.  These are all different brands of computers and in two different physical locations so I know it's not my computer.  Cables To Go 7 Port USB 2.0 Hub that I replaced them with has had no problems with dropping connections."
210,1,This is a cheap basic splitter. I had no problems with it but when the cable guy came to look at something he ripped it out and gave me a new good one. This one is not recommended for cable modems and causes a lot of distortion apparently.
211,2,"I recently reviewed a camera bag that looked (by the picture) like it would handle my needs. Long-story-short: it didn't and I should have questioned the image vs. dimensions, but I don't want to revisit that one again. Since that review I sold all of my 4/3 gear and went with the micro 4/3 format. My old camera bag, which I purchased back in the late 80's was a Tamrac, and I carried it through many airports, up and down the mountain trails in Colorado and it always protected my gear. It's been showing some signs of wear, and I chose this Tamrac bag as it's replacement (judged by the photo and dimensions). While I haven't moved all my stuff into it completely I just wanted to let you know that I didn't have any problems put my Panasonic GH3, and G5KK camera bodies in it along with the following lenses (all Panasonic Lumix): 25mm, 100-300mm, 45-200mm, 7-14mm, and a 45-150mm in the main compartment. I see no reason I won't be able to put various accessories in it either, and just in time for a field trip. This was well worth the price paid!"
212,2,"I purchased this for my Canon ES40 and it fits perfectly. There is enough room for 3 extra batteries, a charger, memory cards, cables and even a small tripod. This is bulky, but it protects everything inside. Very well padded."
213,0,"This was a good router for almost 3 years, then it just stopped working one day. It froze up and the manual reset did nothing. The lights came on but I didnt have anything plugged in. It would not network LAN or send internet. All functions entirely DEAD. I think I'm not going to even try to get a replacement, but will buy a linksys or something. Pissed that I don't have wireless internet right now."
214,2,I got the Koss volume control mainly because I listen to books when I walk and the traffic often makes it difficult to hear.  Being able to just adjust the volume with the Koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my Ipod or MP3 player to do it.  It also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player.  This works exactly like it is advertised.
215,0,Well same thing here i bought this cap thinking it was going to fit the lens i had it didn't fit...will wait for future nikon lens purchase.
216,2,"Works as it should, fits well, with the same quality as the original OEM version, fits all EOS versions that I have."
217,0,"If you are looking for something simple that is as easy as most things for Windows XP, look elsewhere.  Notice that most of these reviews are from Mac users.On the PC side, there is no 'easy' install, like is being claimed here.  Yes, as a geek, I figured it out, but it was not for the normal people out there.  You have to follow instructions!  Worse, the instructions aren't easy to find.  You have to know to search for the manual on the disk.No compatible software!Even though it mentions that it's 'compatible' with all the operating systems (it is), the software that comes with it for backups.... does not work on XP.  So, that leaves you with a hard drive that you need to know how to install.If you are looking for something simple, this is NOT it.  My low rating is based on installation and setup.  I am not knocking it, but want you all to be cautious if you're not a geek or Mac Addict."
218,2,"These external headphone or ear bud volume controls are dificult to find.  This one works very well. Wide range of volume control. Note that miniplug is straigt and not angled as shown in photo of product.  Actually I wanted the straight plug.  Only wish that the small pocket clip was removeable.  Minor detail, however."
219,0,"Received these today and wore them for 3 hours straight (I usually go 5 hours or more with my current headphones). My ears are so very sore now. The ear pieces are very small and the design causes them to poke out from your head instead of angle and curve to your ear.Since they don't fit about my ears, the sound is actually pushed away from them causing a canned effect. I'm not an audiophile by any means so sound quality has never been a big whoop to me, but this canned effect along with being able to hear the ambient noise around me is quite annoying.Because I have a small head, the actual head portion of the phones is also a problem for me. After a few minutes they just slide down my face and I'm constantly adjusting them. Even adjusted to the smallest configuration, they are still too big for me. And dance with them on? Forget about it.I mainly got this to use the volume control knob. It works perfectly fine. Too bad the rest of the phones are an uncomfortable, painful fit."
220,1,"I loved this player when I first picked it up. But it doesn't seem to stand the test of time.I drive truck, so I wanted something that could hold a lot of data (at least 8 hours worth), so a flash player wouldn't cut it (unless at an unacceptable 16kbps). I decided to pick up this player based on it's reviews and 8 min buffer. I figured, just start it playing before I start up the truck.No good. Well at least, not for long. It started to freeze after a couple of months.example:Mary had a litt (pause 90 sec) lamb whose (pause 45 sec/skip) white as...I'm only guessing that's a buffer issue, but either way, it's unacceptable. Player plays fine otherwise, but has done this once while not moving.PRO:Great features on easy to use remoteLooks sharpPlays all bit rate mp3s I put in there (8-196 and VBR), and wmaFantastic battery life with supplemental battery pack (included)!CON:Doesn't keep it's place with very long files (audio books), and bookmarking is a pain in the tucas.Buffer fails with vibration of truck (maybe not an issue in a regular vehicle)Would not consider this for biking or running (If that's what you are looking for, it is a given you need a flash player)As to be expected, the included earbuds are sub par.  I use the Sony Earbud Headphones (MDR-EX70LP).  I can wear those for about four hours a day and not get sore ears"
221,2,"I don't know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions, but the sound is even better. They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years."
222,2,"This little gadget has several uses.It works on Canon Rebel and G series compacts like G 11. You can get steadier tripod pictures when you don't touch the camera when firing.Also if you can't see over a wall or a crowd you can stick the camera over the wall on a tripod or mono pod. Then take the picture with the cable. This works best with a tilt screen camera like the latest Rebel, g-11 or g-12. Or if you are narcissistic you can take pictures of yourself.You can also lock the shutter open and take long time exposures such as night photography. Obviously this device works hand in hand with a tripod"
223,2,"I recently purchased two of the Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel trackballs. I needed/wanted one for my desktop Windows PC and one for my desktop Mac. I first hooked it up and installed it on the Windows PC and immediately loved it. Its ergonomic design makes it very comfortable (only for right handers) and the tracking is very responsive. I looked forward to installing it on my Mac.I researched customer reviews, Logitech's Web site, PC World's Web site and Mac World. I could not find any support or even troubleshooting ideas for getting this product to work with my Mac. I was disappointed because I really do like the trackball. Additionally, the packaging claims that it is Mac compatible but if that's true, there's no help or Mac related instructions. Even the CD ROM that comes with the trackball does not have any MAC executables on it. So, I sent it (the second one) back. After doing some more research I bought, for my Mac, the Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball (model number 646325). Guess what? IT IS WAY BETTER than the Logitech. It is more expensive and it is NOT WIRELESS but in addition to being extrmely comfortable and responsive, it comes with a detachable wrist rest. I've priced comparable wrists rests and a comparable one is $15 - $20.The Logitech is not suitable for laptops because a wired USB receiver needs to be plugged into your computer for the trackball to work. This would be very cumbersome in a laptop environment.So, while the Logitech is a very good product, it is not, in my humble opinion, the best or most comfortable trackball out there. That, and the Mac non compatibility issue are the only reasons I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5. While some may argue that the price difference makes the Logitech a better ""value"" I disagree. These are items that I use 10 to 15 hours six days a week and having a comfortable solution that will prevent stress and/or carpal tunnel...well, an extra $15 or $20 for that is prevention I'm HAPPY to pay.Buy this product for your Windows PC with confidence. If you buy the Logitech, for additional comfort, also buy the  ""Fellowes Gel Flex Transparent Mini Wrist Rest (Blue Crystal)"" for $12.99 at Amazon.Or, if you don't need a wireless solution buy the Kensington, which has a very comfortable padded wrist rest included.Happy Computing!"
224,0,"Installation of the driver was easy, however this converter did not work for my application and my computer is unable to recognize the device I am connecting to this coverter."
225,0,"I bought this cooler at the same time as I bought my Acer Aspire 5600 laptop (almost 2 years ago now). It worked well for a few months and then began cutting in and out forcing me to jiggle the connector the USB cable plugged into to keep the fans running. Eventually it stopped completely. I took it apart to see if I could repair the connector but it wasn't possible. I've been using the laptop without a cooler but I'm very careful not to block any vents. So far, so good."
226,2,I think is better have two ways for take the pictures without touch the camera.... but is a good deal any way!!!
227,2,"I have had a pair of Koss PortaPro headphone since they came out about 20 years ago.  They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?  You will be very happy with the PortaPro."
228,0,"I bought this lens a few weeks ago and it consistently produces out of focus images at f/2.8 through f/4.0  Amazon was great to work with, and they sent a replacement which turned out to be defective as well.  I've shot several hundred images on each, under various lighting conditions, using my 5D Mark II body.  The two exaples I evaluated are very poor performers at f/4.0 and wider.  One went back to Amazon as defective, another went to Canon for a warranty claim.I hope they can fix this lens, because I really want it to perform as well as some of the better examples of this product out there.If you buy the 70-200 f/2.8 L IS, be sure to test it at wide apperture values while you can still return it.Shame on Canon for a poor quality control process."
229,2,"The Velbon 607/F is a pretty nice tripod, especially for the money. I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy."
230,0,"I love the security of knowing the camera is water resistant, and the battery life is so good I have hardly ever used the second battery I purchased.But... it has a big flaw, one in common with other Olympus products.  If you hand the camera to someone to take a picture... 99 times out of 100... they will accidentially turn the camera off.  The slide switch is annoying, overly sensitive, and very very fragile.  If (or when) it breaks the repair charge is a minimum $125.Flash pictures are another issue... they always come out with wierd yellowish colors.  Overall I'm just barely satisfied with this model, and very unhappy when compared to my prior (stolen) Canon PowerShot."
231,0,"I've had the PX200s for about 2 weeks now, and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed with them. I've had several sets of Sennheisers in the past, and this is the first set I've really been disappointed with. I could just be jaded by my AKG K701s, but I don't think that's it. Even after breaking in, I find the sound on these headphones very harsh and unpleasant. I purchased them as a set of lightweight headphones for more casual use and travel (the K701s are really a home headphone and needs a headphone amp to sound best). The midrange on the PX200s I find to be over emphasized, there's very little bass response, and the high end it shrill. There's nothing smooth or refined about the sound at all. It is possible to use a equalizer to smooth out the sound some, but it requires huge changes in the signal, way more processing than should be necessary. With enough changes, it's possible to balance out the midrange and high end, but the low end never really develops. For someone who is less critical these may be fine, but I can't really recommend them.A better option, even though they're twice the price (as of this review), is the Ultrasone Zino (also available on Amazon). I have recently received them, and they are a much better choice for sound quality, and even overall build quality. The Zino's have much more balanced sound, better build, and a more comfortable fit, though slightly larger. They may be twice the price, but they sound 10x better. They are worth the extra money, by far. If you're going to spend this much, you might as well make the jump and get your money's worth.Ultrasone Zino S-Logic Natural Surround Sound Portable Headphone"
232,0,"While I am not a complete computer geek, I do have some experience working on/fixing computers. However, the WRT54G Wireless router has just about been the death to me.Yesterday, I received my new Gateway 4500 with a built in wireless network card... the whole thing was going to be ""Plug-and-play"" I would turn on my comuter and it would automatically find my Linksys router... awesome... or so I thought. After 4 frustrating hours on the phone with my internet provider, Gateway, and Linksys - I stll do not have the dumb thing working! Apparently, Linksys routers are known to be tricky in configuring to a wireless network - Gateway even provided SPECIAL instructions for this particular router (they didn't work... of course).Also, while the technical service response was friendly - Linksys should hire native speakers to help their American clients. Our inability to communicate doubled a 45 minute phone call into 90 minutes - I literraly spent half of my time saying ""could you reapeat that"". More frustating is the fact that it wasn't one person at the help desk - both people I talked to had horrible English.To sum it all up - 4 hours of wasted time - still no internet access- My suggestion - unless you are truly a computer expert (or plan to hire one) do not buy this product."
233,1,"So, I got this card from a Dell 4600.There doesn't seem to be much support from Creative for the drivers for Windows 7.Sound hardware hasn't changed by magnitudes like chipsets or video cards yet Creative cant make available or write some simple drivers for Windows 7.Search the net for SB0200 and Dell 4600 and you'll find my drivers for Windows 7 (x32)!"
234,2,"There are 3 remotes for the Canon Rebel XTI.A wired remote, and two wireless remotes.This is the one that can take instant pictures, and be programmed with a 2 second delay.It works, exactly as expected. It clips on your neck strap securely.Be warned, the infrared receiver is on the front of the XTI, so both wireless remotes will only work from the front."
235,1,"I have owned two of this headphones. The 1st one, which was also purchased from Amazon, lost sound in one ear after using for two years or so, without any noticeable sign of faultiness except no sound and I ordered another one from Amazon because I liked this headphone for its sound quality and comfort. After 15 months, the 2nd broke again, much faster than the 1st one, this time the line wears off and was broken at the connection to the earpiece. I think I am not going to order one more of this kind any more."
236,2,"Better than I could have hoped. They are comfortable, sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound. Makes my iPod Touch the music machine I always wanted."
237,0,This didn't work with my laptop/phone combination [IBM ThinkPad T43 / LG enV].  Amazon was great about returning it and I received a full refund and they paid for shipping!
238,2,"Ok, I went on a headphone buying spree, so I'm comparing these PortaPros to headphones that cost many times as much (Sennheiser HD595), headphones that cost a bit more (Sennheiser PX100) and my old Sony headphones. Well, my Sonys are history. I never realized how smeary they were--no detail.These Koss PortaPros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones I mentioned. Good detail and the frequency balance is excellent, far preferable to the PX100s and even comparable to the expensive phones. Very pleasant to listen to. If I had never heard those expensive phones, I would be happy to have these Koss PortaPros as my only phones.What I've learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as ""soundstage"". With the Koss phones, everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears. Not unpleasant, and you won't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself, but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your ears--far more realistic. I know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison, but I just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid for.So the bottom line is, I am in love with the sound of my expensive HD595 headphones and at the same time I am very happy to have these Koss PortaPros for portable use. As a bonus, the PortaPros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones. And, unlike some folks, I wouldn't say they are ugly at all--just different."
239,0,I listened to these and the bass is way too deep.Feels like youre gonna fry your ears.Even if you set the bass to the middle it still sounds like bad.Trust me if you want a great product from this company just buy the Wave Radio youll be much happier.It is almost indistinguishable from my expensive Sony stereo and the speakers sound just as good if not better than my SSMB200H bookshelf speakers.That is a high peak in technology and worth the money.These headphones are horrible though.
240,2,"Not much to write, this is a great addition for those headphones which don't have their own volume control and you don't want to mess with the Windows volume or your music player volume.I just put them on high and control the volume through this instead.Recommended."
241,1,"Its a very nice headphone... nice sound... but I found it very heavy.. after using for about an hour of so, I used to get head ache.. so stopped using it.. but I will still recommend it for its good quality and also for a short time use..."
242,0,I used this product for a few months and then it just completely died.  I kept it in good condition and everything but it just stopped working.
243,1,"These were wonderful until one side stopped working. I tore it apart and resoldered the wires, it worked well for a while, but now acting up. My little brother now uses them, and deals with it. I wish mine wouldnt have broke. I've contemplated getting another."
244,2,"It's true, when I'm on the go, these are what I take with me.They leak sound, but what does it matter when you're smashin' a DJ set?Bestow these on your head, and you might look like something from Tron.So work it, because these have a very clear sound. The bass isn't amped, but you don't want it to be if you're producing music.For what it is, plus the lifetime warranty ($6 for shipping) - I've suggest these to many a person.P.S. - It's been over a year of heavy use, and even losing them once in a moshpit, only to later find them sweaty, but unharmed!These things can take a hit, and the bass is still better than I thought it would be."
245,0,"I must have gotten a bad lens based on these reviews but then again maybe they don't have to look at thousands of images at 100% in a photo editor. This is the worst lens I've ever owned. It is soft, soft, soft. Even my cheap 50mm 1.8 is significantly sharper.One reviewer said it's sharp on all four corners; not mine. It is embarrassingly fuzzy on the corners at any aperture and the edges as well as the middle too and forget about zone focusing. One of the great things about a lens like this is you can supposedly zone focus so that at .f.8 everything from 5 ft. to infinity is in focus - wrong.For the price this lens is a rip-off. This lens does have a sweet spot but you'll wait a long time finding it and it'll happen once in a blue moon. How can an image from a lens shot with a Canon 5D at 1/500 and .f.8 on a sunny day be soft? Unbelievable. Another reviewer wrote it can be had used for 30 Euros - I don't doubt it. Whoever buys mine when I upgrade should call the police."
246,2,"i have tried a lot of portable cans - everything ranging from cheap gumdrops, all different beats up to bose noise cancelling) - I always end up coming back to the koss porta pro. Its can fold up into a small package like a mini transformer, its comfortable  (i never got hair stuck - unlike my akgs) and the sound is amazing. Bass is strong, the mids are pretty good. Its very good for current day music. It is very energy efficient - can set your iphone at halfway and still get good sound.I wouldn't recommend it if your musical set is acoustics or other lighter genre however still much better than say stock buds."
247,1,"Nothing special. Just plain 'ol speaker wire. It did, and continues to do its job. My only complaint is that the last 10 feet of the roll was cut from the rest of the roll. 50 feet in all, but not a continuous 50 feet. This could have been an issue, but I only needed two 15 foot runs (30 ft. total)."
248,0,"The big speaker on this baby sounds pretty good and it gets decently loud, but getting the radio to lock into a station is difficult and when you walk by or move your hand near the radio it can disrupt even strong signals. I was expecting more from Panasonic.Go for the Sony ICF-F10 or ICF-18 if you're looking for a radio this size with good sound and better tuning."
249,2,"I was a long time loyalist to the Sennheiser PX 100 headphones. I went through two pairs in a few years but was absolutely bummed when I heard that they were no longer producing them. Instead, they improved on the design but I didn't want to spend the extra money and the reviews weren't as promising as the original models.Instead, I looked around and settled on the PortaPros. The sound is awesome, the storage is very good (not as great as the PX100's), they are very durable, the cord length is perfect, and the 1980 throwback design is just a bonus. Once I wear down my current pair that I'm using right now, I will definitely have to buy another."
250,0,"The router described on Amazon's page and in the downloadable user's manual offered as part of that description is not the router you will get. All information describes Netgear's original model the MR814. You will get the MR814 v2 which has no stand, is half the size, has a 2db antenna rather than the original 5db (and it is not removable like the original) etc. The MR814 v2 is an inferior, cost cutting product. Which probably accounts for the wide range of ratings you see in the 400 customer comments. Except for those that didn't get their rebates which means they paid even more for an inferior product. Read those comments carefully before you decide to buy on price alone.And Amazon - how about updating this page with current information."
251,1,The ear pieces are very tight for me space wise.  My ears are not abnormal in size but I have to put them over my ears carefully so that they won't hurt after awhile having some portions pinched by the ear pieces.  They clamp pretty tight also.  All else are great.
252,0,"I've been a long time Palm user starting with a Pro and owning 6 or 7 since, most recently an M515.  The screen was what first attracted me to this unit plus the wireless network, well, it 'sort of' worked for a month, but I've had enough.  This unit seems like it would be a good idea, but isn't.  Installation and initial sync went very smooth, but that was only the beginning.DAY 1: First day carrying it, it locked up solidly - it wouldn't turn off or soft reset, I didn't have the CD w/the manual on it (bad idea) with me, so I didn't know how to hard reset.  I tried taking the battery off, but the unit just came back on (in it's locked up state) when the battery was reinstalled - so I just let it die.  I spent that evening getting it running again and trying to get the wireless networking to connect to my Linksys WAP11.  After fiddling way too much, I finally got my mail and MSN Messenger to work, but not the browser.  Finally I called HP's support site and was warned that any help he gave me was on a 'best try only' basis - no promises - we couldn't get the thing to work.DAY 2: I left the wireless networking enabled and went to work - the battery was completely dead by Noon - with wireless enabled the battery seems to have a painfully short life.  So I spent that evening restoring it again.  I went to HP's website and found an external battery ...Perfect huh?  - Ordered this puppy immediately - only to find it only works with the expansion pack which adds expansion slots,  but also a LOT of bulk - just to have a reasonable battery life?  I called HP to return it and the agent sent me to the parts department for a second battery to carry.  ....  he assured me that I didn't have the skills to replace the battery.  I told him that it just had a little latch on it and it flipped out and I was quite sure I could handle it.  He replied that the case was sealed and that no one but HP was authorized to open it.  I told him that tech support had asked me to remove the battery to retrieve the serial number from the label under it and didn't see the problem with removing it.  He was then VERY annoyed, told me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and hung up.  I figured that there will be higher capacity batteries in the aftermarket soon.Now it's over 3 weeks later and although I haven't missed any meetings or anything because this thing failed me, I've come close, and instead of just grabbing my Palm and using it without giving it any thought, I find myself reaching for it and wondering if it's going to work.  I finally decided I've had enough.  I picked out one of the new [brand name] Palm OS units w/MP3 and ordered it.  I then decided to call HP and see if they would consider a return for a one month old order - they did so without hesitation - they looked at their records and saw that I had several tech support contacts on it, appologized that it didn't work out and even sent FedEx with a pickup tag.The Palm is by far a better platform for simple organizer tasks, but the PPC 'horsepower' is great when using spreadsheets and the like - I thought I could have both...."
253,2,"This Is a Good bag, its really good for the beginner Camera Guy, i just got a rebel camera, and so far i can fit the camera and 2 other lenses in , (really kinda looks like its made just for the Rebel slr cams nothing bigger) i may be able to fit 2 more lenses depending on the size, i dont have enough room for my cords like my adapters and things. i can kinda fit my charger inside, i can fit my sd cards inside as well, but its worth it , has a fanny pack strap as well as the shoulder strap"
254,0,"I didn't buy this from Amazon. It was a delayed ""impulse"" purchase from a local store a few days ago. After getting it home, I became curious about product reviews and checked with Amazon...user experiences were a bit scary, to say the least. Creative's scant 90 day parts/labor warranty only added to the insecurity. However, the player worked, sound was beautiful, so I tried to convince myself that everything would be all right.That was Monday evening. As of Friday morning, the player was totally dead. Pressing/holding the power button did nothing, even after inserting a new AAA battery...in fact, I tried TWO brand new batteries, with the same result each time.The memory module still functions--I inserted it into my computer's USB port and all is well. I didn't buy it as flash memory for my computer, however. I bought it as a portable Mp3 unit--and that's totally dead.My faith in Creative Labs is shaken--from other user's comments, from my own unhappy experience with this product, and from the pathetic excuse for a warranty--and Creative even wants you to pay to ship the product back to them during the warranty period. Forget it, this item is being returned to the place of purchase within 24 hours. There are better choices, from better companies, with better warranties.Buyer beware!"
255,0,"I do not recommend these.  First of all, there are a lot of wires that always get tangled up.  For some reason one ear piece has a much shorter chord than the other, which is often frustrating and leads to the shorter one falling out.  As for the noise reduction, it's not what you'd expect.  They do perform well on airplanes, blocking that annoying engine and air sound, but they do nothing on a subway or while walking.  While walking, you'll hear brushing from your clothes mixed with your music.  Also, most of the noise reduction comes from the ear buds blocking noise rather than the technology.  Spend a little more for a better brand."
256,2,I bought these zip ties to put up Christmas lights on my deck so I wouldn't have to nail/staple and they worked very well.
257,0,"Hmm, since most of the glowing reviews here are written by people without a profile, I wonder if they are not fake reviews.I'm a real user, and I'm not happy with the Netgear MR814v2 which I bought from Amazon.  Note this regards the ""v2"" version, not the older one.Basically the cable router part works ok.  But wi-fi is a joke.  I checked out negative reviews here and also on CNet and found that many people including myself get no more than 20 ft. of reception with the Netgear, even in the same room.  This is a far cry from the 500 ft. indoors promised in the user's guide.Worse, I e-mailed customer service (no phone number to call) over a week ago and didn't even receive an acknowledgement, let alone a response.  I e-mailed them again this morning and it's been 5 hours, still no acknowledgement or response.  This is one terrible company to deal with, in the leagues of Apple and Samsung, in terms of simply avoiding to assist their customers.I suggest you avoid Netgear until they improve their products *and* customer support.  In the meantime, go with a better brand like Linksys or Microsoft."
258,1,"This is the third of these I have purchased because I like the design and the price, but these are made in China with sub-American standard tolerances on machines and poor factory quality control.  There are three large pieces, apparently made on different lines, and they just mis-fitting together.I give 4 stars for design, four stars for stability and functionality, but ZERO stars for construction quality.Two pieces are the wired tops.  Inserting the bottom wired piece into the base finds it going into the holes in the base, but not in near the centers of the holes.  The plastic fasteners need the inserted wires to be in the center to screw on properly and without stripping.  The tool they provide makes it easy to strip the threads in the soft plastic, but it can be done with patience and firm, but not excessive force.  Put the force on centering the wire, not on the plastic fastener, or the threads will be stripped.  Two people can do this better than one.That done, then the job is to put the two wired assemblies together.  Again, they require a good bit of adjusting, difficult because there are four wires to be placed into the receivers, and you cannot put one down to far, or the others are at too great an angle.  Again, it requires patience, firmness, and four hands are better than two.The little decorative balls on the top are worthless.  In my three units, 12 balls, only two have had properly sized holes in the wooden balls.  One was way too large and just wobbled on the top with no friction at all on the sides.  The other 11, including all four of these, were way too small.  For the first unit I bought, I went to a woodworker friends and borrowed his vice and drill bits and made the holes big enough.Now all of the balls have been tossed without loss of aesthetics.This is a very nice design, and it is a pity that the manufacturing tolerances are so substandard."
259,0,"You get what ya pay for! This is the much-talked about ""Nifty Fifty"". Out of the box it feels cheap and plastic, why because it is a cheap build and plastic!1) AF in low light... Not good it hunts2) Sharp Not at all3) Build well as stated, plastic build plastic lens had it for less than a year and it is CRAP4) Go to ebay and buy a Asahi Pentex 50mm and an adapter ring and learn to focus manually for half the price! Really I own 2 and they way out work this cheap Canon lens geared towards the hobbyist looking for a correct all ""I am a pro"" lens.5)"
260,2,"I had a pair when I was in college back in the mid '70s and they were tops then.Great sound hi and low...not for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch. All others...get your KOSS on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich, full sound."
261,2,"It works pretty much as described, but the problem is that if you ever have to remove the pieces from the wall, and move them, then you're in trouble, and if your power cord is a little bit short, you have another problem. The adhesive on these is good, but if you stick it on the wall, and then have to move it, maybe 2 inches over, the adhesive may or may not stick. And if your power cord inside the plastic pieces is short, and you have to put it at a slight angle to the outlet, the pressure it puts on the plastic runners will pull it off of the wall. The thing I liked the  best about it, was that the color matched my wall, so you have to look hard to see it. And as long as you don't have to remove any piece from the wall, and stick it somewhere else, it works great."
262,0,The left speaker blew out after a short while.  Return window is only 30 days; thought I'd share my pain...
263,2,"Sure these are not the worlds greatest speakers.  Yes the bass is a little low, but you are only paying thirty something dollars.  For the price the speakers are amazing, they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars.  I put a pair of Inifinity Outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource.  So I took the Inifinity's back and had enough money to buy a 300 disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the deck.I would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price.  If you are looking for surround sound speakers, then look elsewhere."
264,0,Buy only COMPACT FLASH compatible products.After your camera dies your memory will live on with other Compact Flash products.
265,1,"10 gigabytes is probably more than you need to store all of your music, so unless you have an incredibly huge collection, the studio 10 is sufficient. This player has great options for playback, and the file system works well. However there are quite a few bugs in the OS, even though I downloaded the most recent version. The supplied computer software is pretty lame, I must say. I bought this player because I though I would put all of my music from CD onto mp3, but I find that I don't use it often. Playing a CD always has better quality, unless you encode at some huge bitrate. Also, the USB connection takes its time. One great feature is the audio out, so you can attach it to a sound system. The rechargeable batteries are great. There's a line in as well, but that is completely pointless since you cant record mp3s. I also thought people would be intrigued by the player, but a lot of people I know confused it with a tape player when they first saw it. If you want to buy this because you dont want to lug around all your CD's, and if you dont mind slightly [worse] quality, go ahead and buy it."
266,2,"The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month."
267,0,I'm sure when this camera was released back around 2003 it was all the rave. I bought this camera back in July 2003 for $350 from Beach Camera. Alot of major annoyances with this camera such as the lens cap- you have to remember to take it off before you turn the camera on or else you get a message saying to take the cap off and restart the camera. The menu is tedious and cumbersome to work with. The manual settings take too much time. The start up time lags. Time between shots lag especially using flash. It can take up to 16 seconds between shots using flash. (You will definately lose alot of good potential shots using this camera). Its only a 4 megapixel camera. That might have been good in 2003 but in 2009- its time to buy a new camera. Does not have image stabilization.(IS is a must in 2009).The camera is pretty noisy while focusing. Battery usage is very low as is expected with all PS cameras. The included software is pretty much useless in 2009. Picture quality is pretty good which is one of this cameras highlights. So in conclusion- if you are on a shoe string budget then this is the camera you are going to get. I would not pay more than $70 used as this camera is over 6 years old in 2009. Dont expect any keeper shots if you need fast recycling time between shots. This camera was state of the art 6 years ago. Not anymore.
268,2,"I've had this remote now for about 2 weeks and have used it several times for a beginning photography class I am taking and our first assignment was taking self-portraits. If you are taking self-portraits or group photos with you in them in a well-lit scene, then this remote is perfect. I have found that you DO need to point the remote pretty much directly at the sensor on your camera (so that will be just to the left of the lens as you face your camera). It does not seem to register the click from any other angle. And as I stated, there MUST be good lighting to use it. I tried a few shots in a candle-lit setting and the remote did NOT work. The camera sensor doesn't seem to be able to pick it up in darkened situations. So if you want something for more than self-portraits in any lighting condition and at any angle from farther than 15 ft, then you should get a remote that uses radio frequencies, but I think those cost upwards of $100+. And one more note, this remote comes with a plastic cover that you will want to keep on it when not in use because it prevents the button from being accidentally pressed if you have it stored tightly in with all of your other equipment. My friend learned this the hard way when he pulled it out to use it and the batteries were dead because some of his other equipment happened to be pressing against the button when he had it in his pack."
269,1,"This speaker set does produce amazing sound, and I did get several years of use from them before the plugs that connect the speakers caused issues and the sound would not feed properly to the speakers. After a lot of fiddling and fussing around with the faulty plugs, I decided to just quit trying to fix it and replaced the entire system. So yes, they sound great, but it was a real bummer to have to retire this system just because the plugs they use to attach the speakers don't last."
270,0,"The upper limit on my D-Link 7-port hub seems to be four devices regardless of whether they are self powered.  Some devices don't work properly in one port, but do in another, even if they are the only devices plugged into the hub.  Furthermore, some devices seem to collide through the hub.  For example, only two of my USB drives will run concurrently.  Worse, I've seen data corruption when a drive is plugged into four of the seven ports; I thought a La Cie USB hard drive was defective until I plugged it directly into the PC.  The center three ports seem to blank out occasionally, but recover after a reboot.I'm on Amazon now looking for a more reliable replacement. My experience with D-Link products has been more miss than hit.One final nit is the power connector jack is a right angle type and is a bit loose.  I had to improvise a strain relief with tape."
271,0,"I owned this hub for a year, and twice had to call D-Link for a RMA number to exchange it under warranty. After the third one died, I just gave up.  I spent more on shipping than I would have spent on just buying a new hub from a different manufacturer.So what went wrong?  In each case the hub seemed to overheat and die.  I could actually smell that distinct odor of frying circuit board.  Never had anything particularly power-hungry hooked up: two iPods, a scanner, a digital camera.I understand if it happened once, or even twice, but three times a bad hub?  Not likely.  Since the new hub I got from a different manufacturer is working well, then the conclusion must be that it is the D-Link design that is at fault."
272,2,"I've been using this headphone for a few months.For the build - It looked filmsy, but even I haven't been using it very carefully, it's still working well, no parts broken.For the sound quality, the bass is very good, mid-range is good. I hope the high range could be a bit clearer.  Meanwhile, I found that this headphone is quite musical, no harsh high range, and enjoyable to listen to, especially for piano music, easy listening, and jazz music.  Still the high range could be a bit improved; but, at this price range, it's very okay."
273,0,"I bought this router to establish a wireless network at home, under windows xp. I had a lot of troubles when i first installed in in my cousin's computer. Allegedly, there are compatibility problems with Mcafee products and this router.I bought this one because my uncle bought one a couple years ago and everything worked flawlessly. The in ternet speed was amazing and I did the installation in just a few minutes. They never reported any problems and they dont know anything about OS or networking. I had read about linksys reputation and being a cisco company I went and picked this one without a doubt, paying more than the average price of the competition (dlink, netgear or belkin).For my unpleasant surprise, i realized linksys had changed the operating system of the router for a much worse one. This is the reason of most bad reviews. This one, after version 5,included, has become an awful product. with lots of imcompatibily problems and in general a bad performance. The DHCP server doesnt work very well. If you use P2P programs to download from the internet your D/L speeds will be very low. You might find yourself losing connection without any reason or logical pattern, and it will result in long hours of frustrating efforts TRYING to solve the issues.If you want to stick to linksys for whatever reason, pick the one with linux compatibility and get some 3party firmware. Do not waste your money and time with this. Another good option (probably the best) is the Zyxel x-550."
274,2,"I bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great!  Sure they don't have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers, but at this price they do they job perfectly.  They have already been through several rain storms here in Georgia and continue to work fine.  Highly recommended!"
275,2,This is a nice bag to keep a compact DSLR in. It has just enough room for my D40 camera and strap in the main section while a spare battery and lens pen is in the outside pocket. It is tight to fit the strap in however it feels secure in the case. I would have to get a larger one if I upgrade my lens over the 17-55 I have now.I feel the cushioning is quite good for the bag and it is just great for a person who wants to travel light.
276,2,"These headphones has very good sound. They fold up well being careful.  I like them. But, I wish the quailty of the audio was  bit better."
277,0,"The headphones stay in place very well during jogging, workouts, etc.  My major complaint is that they do not fit tightly in the ear and so all the sound is higher end tinny.  There is absolutely no bass whatsoever."
278,0,"This item seems like a good idea, but the truth is, it really does not work well.  The threads are too shallow and the hinge part is always in the way.  I used it for about an hour, then took it off and went back to the teathered lens cover.  If you want one for free, I'll send you mine!"
279,0,I have had trouble with both mini plug and RCA plugs. They are too large to use with my MP3 player and my receiver. They plug in part way and the connections are not tight enough to use. I think it is due to the large cable size.
280,1,"A major shortcoming of this offering is that you cannot convert your existing MDs into mp3 files.  I wrongly assumed that since you could place MP3s onto MDs that you could perform the reverse operation, BUT you cannot.Therefore, my existing MDs cannot be converted to mp3s, which is exceedingly frustrating.If anyone knows of an offering where this is possible, would you post it here??"
281,1,"I had these for about a year and I can't really comment on how ""great"" the sound is since I just use them. The right side just stopped working so I might get another pair of headphones soon."
282,0,"After using KOSS products for years I am disappointed. First the headband was too big, so it did not fit on my ear right. If that was not bad enough, then there is the sound. The lows and highs are good but the midrange is weak. The vocals sound like they are in the background and are almost muffled at times. The cheap KOSS clip-on's sound better. This headphone just makes KOSS look and sound bad. Don't waste your money."
283,2,"I bought one of these cameras and find it to be all that the others have said. However, I find that in the bright sunlight you have trouble seeing  the image in the LCD display. It would be of benefit to have a viewfinder,  wish it did."
284,1,Since we have no installed the battery in the camera we are not able to give it a review at this time.
285,0,"I have just bought this new canon NP-E3, at the first glance I was so disappointed, it's made in CHINA, unlike the original one supplied with camera was made in Japan. I have not been trying to shoot to see how long does it last yet but if you think there is no different between the products made in Japan and China then you were totally wrong. I call Canon sale support and ask for this information, they've told me as what they see it supposed to be made in Japan. To be confirmed more information about this battery, I called Canon dealer BHphotovideo and Sammy's camera and ask for this. Guess what! They said made in CHINA. What a shame on Canon new generation. I hat off to you."
286,2,"If you have a 50 dollar budget for headphones. Stop looking. Add to cart and buy.I'd heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels, and finally had to give in and try them out. I'm so glad I did. The sound exceeds my more expensive, mid-level Klipsch Image One, and I kind of like the way they look too.I'm serious, though. Don't let the looks fool you, the PortaPros are performers! If these are anywhere near your budget, just get them.Note: They're not noise-isolating by any stretch, but the fidelity more than makes up for this."
287,0,"I bought a couple of these to work with a pFsense router.  Not many of you will know what that is, but it is essential an obscure but highly secure router/firewall software package, based upon FreeBSD.  It is likely this has nothing to do with your life, so take this with a grain of salt."
288,0,"I bought this as soon as I bought my 40D with the 28-135mm kit lens.My first impression was that it was made of tough material that was at least water resistant.With my setup, this pack was a perfect fit for my needs.Quick access, discreet, very light, extremely accessible, and cheap.One thing I did right away was cut off the waist straps that are tucked away in the rear of the pack.  I decided I would never need it and was just taking up space.Then I upgraded to the kit lens to the 24-70L lens.  This pack was no longer a comfortable fit.  Although it would go in, the fit was extremely tight and impossible to zipper (only zelcro shut).Last week, with this pack slung around one shoulder, I got out of my car.  The strap slipped off my right shoulder and caught on my elbow.  Unfortunately, the front element made contact with the pavement from about 6"" of the ground.  At that time, I didn't think there would be any damage.  I found out later that it was enough to crack my $80 B+W UV filter on my 24-70L. I recognize that it was due to my negligence, but it would have been more safe for me to sling my 40D with the standard camera strap (which is shorter and has more grip), than to store it in this pack with a more slippery nylon strap.I would NOT suggest getting this bag because:1)  NOT ENOUGH PADDING!2)  DO NOT buy a camera bag that only lets you store your camera lens down! (Too much risk)3)  Doesn't protect camera from minor drops. (Actually may increase risk of damage to lens because it can only be stored facing down)4)  Minimal to no extra storage space.If you spent $$$$ on your camera set up, don't go cheap with this bag. Invest in something that will sufficiently protect your camera!(I have since ordered the Crumpler 5 MDH and store the camera sideways, so that the lens is no longer facing down)"
289,0,"When I bought these speakers I was very, very pleased with the quality of sound and the sleak design. Unfortunately, after about three months I started getting distortion even at very low volume levels. I talked to a speaker salesman that said I probably just got some lemons. A contributing problem is that I cannot get in touch with Monsoon. Their site is down [[...] and their new site has been &quot;coming soon&quot; for several weeks now [[...] Now I am stuck with once awesome, but now terrible sounding speaker."
290,1,"I bought these headphones on the basis of the great reviews and the price (remanufactured at &lt; $35.00 US).  After three days of burning in I turned the headphones on.  HEY WHERE IS THE FULLNESS??  The sound was detailed but thin; clear but lacking in soundstage; also although I heard the vocals clearly there was a minute disruption in vocal continuity. The sound was also too slow. OK, my basis are the Grados SR60 which are bias towards fast, exciting sound but are not the most open soundstage themselves.  Still I even found most of the music fatiguing - I wanted to say, ""come on...please? pretty please make my music PLAY!!""In any regards, I turned on some classical and the music was tranquil, non-fatiguing, gentle, detailed and very nice.  I guess these are classical headphones.  I was hoping for more."
291,1,My honest opinion... Its cheap and the quality is not as reliable or as good as Sony.  The sound quality through any of the earphones I tried (I tried quality ones too) which I subsequently tried on other portables did not produce a strong sound even at the highest sound setting.  The hinge under the top lid looks like it would break very easily as it shifted side to side.  The sound comming through the line out was superb I must say but I dont want to carry around my speakers.  Stick with the more reliable and consistent sony- they just keep ticking this one is fragile and week.
292,2,"Killer Compact CB for motorcycle or any vehicle.  Even if you rarely have need for emergency roadside communication this radio has options that exceed many full size CB radios. Mujltiple freq scanning and programmable favorites.  instant access to the channels you follow. Compact, portable and simple to use."
293,1,"Do not expect much reliability from this player. I have two of these vcrs for about three months now and I have not had any problems yet, they work fine. However their built quality is poor and they feel very flimsy, but for [the price] you cannot ask too much. If it breaks I will get a new one. I had a JVC before this one and it was way worse than the Panasonic. The loading mechanism in the JVC was terrible and some tapes kept getting stock in there. The loading system in the Panasonic is much smoother and it takes any tapes I throw at it. I have also another Panasonic which is 6 years old (it has a blue display instead than the green one) and it has a higher built quality than these new models. Unfortunately most electronic components today are designed and built to break easily in order to sale more units. Gone are those days where reliability was the most important aspect, it just isn't profitable anymore. Overall: GOOD to FAIR."
294,1,"I bought this a bit ago because I was having problems with my cable modem disconnecting during downloads and since I had tried different coax cables/network cables/routers I figured this would be the last step to try.For cable TV it worked great,channels come in perfectly,cable modem synced up and worked and all seemed well until it started to disconnect again on downloads.I happened to find an old splitter in my closet that I thought I had lost and now everything works perfectly..it so happens to be another RCA splitter.I am not really sure what the problem is with my original splitter from the cable company and this one but just to warn anyone with a cable modem that if you experience problems this could be it."
295,2,"Just an everyday case, nothing to fancy, but it does fit well.  Exactly as described.  Great fast shipping.  There are however better ways than this to carry your handheld."
296,1,"The product does exactly what it is designed to actually do, and it does so reliably. But the real question is does what the product actually do stand up to it's marketing as a way to stop telemarketers from calling you.The answer is, to some degree, sort-of.The way it works is this: The telemarketer calls you. You (or your answering machine) answers the call, and the TeleZapper beeps. If the telemarketer is using the right equipment to recognize that tone as being a non-working number, the telemarketer will automatically disconnect from the call, and theoretically delete your phone number from the list it is using.So let's look at this closer. Your phone still rings. If you (or your answering machine) does not answer the ringing phone, the beep-tone is never heard by the telemarketer's equipment. The result of not answering the phone is the same with or without the TeleZapper.Okay, so we have to answer the phone once. But after that one time aren't we deleted from the lists they all use? Well, no. There are lots of lists out there. Some are used only once. Doesn't do much good to be removed from a list that will never be used again. But in all fairness, you will be removed from a few lists that might have gotten used again.My personal experience was that initially there was no change in the number of calls. It took some time before any of those beeps my TeleZapper made had any effect on whether or not I was going to get called again. During this first period, I still got to talk to a lot of telemarketers because they weren't using equipment that the TeleZapper had any effect upon.After about three or four months, I realized that there were far fewer times that I answered the phone, and no one was there. That could mean one of two things: Either the TeleZapper was working, and I was really was being taken off the lists, or telemarketers stopped using the kind of equipment that's stopped by the TeleZapper.It's been over two years now, and at one point there was a big change in the number of calls coming in. For a few weeks I was suddenly again getting lots of calls with no one there. My speculation is that the TeleZapper worked, and I was taken off of quite a few lists, but at that point all new lists were put into use, and those lists once again included my name.You can't really control who calls you on the phone any more than you can control which people you pass on the street will say something to you. But just as there are things that you can do to discourage people you pass from saying something to you, there are things you can do to discourage telemarketers from calling you. The TeleZapper can be a part of your arsenal, but don't expect it to be the best tool you can use. And since the TeleZapper doesn't start to do anything unless you (or your answering machine) picks up the phone, don't expect this tool to take the lead, either.So the TeleZapper functions. It does have some effect. Is it worth the price? Well, I don't have any regrets about spending the money, but I wouldn't do it again.Unfortunately, as I rewrite this review, the Federal Do Not Call List is being challenged by the telemarketers. Some state's Do Not Call Lists were disassembled because of the coming of the Federal list. But despite the problems, I still would suggest signing-up for the Federal Do Not Call List, and if your state still is accepting new sign-ups, get on their list, too.Still, I believe the best tool is to simply say, ""Please put me on your do not call list,"" and hang-up. On the other hand, if you're not as assertive as I can be with Telemarketers, the TeleZapper saves you from having to speak directly to sone telemarketers, so the price may be worth it to you. Just remember that the phone will still ring, and you, or an answering machine will still have to pick-up before the TeleZapper does anything.Also, check-out the newer version of the TeleZapper. It is smaller, and is also capable of generating not just the simple beep that this one can, but the three-tones that you often hear if you call a number that's not working. (The problem with the three tones is that people you want to talk to assume there is something wrong with your phone, and hang-up.) Both the old and the new TeleZapper essentially work the same, so I would suggest choosing by price."
297,2,This was a suggested item from Amazon when I purchased the Garmin eTrex Legend HCX.  The handle bar mount will fit all eTrex except for the HCX model because the memory card makes the back case a different size.  Was still able to use the handle bar mount because of the adapter that came with the GPS.  If you have the HCX just order the handle bar mount without the battery pack.  It will save you $4 and do the same thing.
298,0,I bought this for the celestron astromaster 70 which is only good for lunar observation. I found that the filter darkens the moon too much and details are lost. I feel better viewing without the filter...its even worse if you use a 2X barlow lense I also bought.
299,0,"As much as I want it to work, NetGear's MR814 wireless router does not work with my Compaq 2500 54g enabled laptop. The laptop works great at Borders T-Mobil Hot Spot, CompUSA's many wireless networks in their store, etc. The router does indeed work with NetGear's own PCMCIA card in the laptop, but not the built in 54g which should indeed be compatable with the 11.b standard. If you use NetGear's own PC Card (PCMCIA) you are fine, but be careful with any other vendor which claims to have compatability with the 802.11b standard using NetGear products."

301,0,"The markers were dried up, but I was given an immediate refund, so I'm happy about that."
302,0,I have used these before...But this version didn't work well.A very short distance being used and it worked for a day and then could never get it to talk again.I would try another brang.
303,0,"This set of headphone is cheap. As a result doesn't have a good quality.The construction is not good, giving a feeling of some very cheap plastic.The sound quality is flat, not appealing for any kind of music.It is loose. I don't understand how such a designed for sport headphone cannot stay on my ears firmly; it cannot fit into ears well either, 1/3 of the ""head part"" is out of ear.However, for such a price, this headphone is ok. I just use it for working out at gym so I wouldn't tear up my good one.The shipping is really good! It's free shipping and arrived within 2 days. Amazing!"
304,1,"I had another RCA (with no powered amplification) and that one was as good as this one. I was hoping that the amplifier would give better quality and might receive more channels, but no. So, this one as good as any other cheaper RCA model (atleast my ANT120B) and not worth extra price."
305,2,"Reluctantly I've been converting from paper to my new Palm m105. While I have gotten grafitti pretty well down, it is a slow process for adding data. And forget taking notes with it. Now I add in a lot of data using the Palm Desktop program, but there are times I'm just without the computer and need to get more than a line or two of data in.This is where the keyboard shines. Coming in its own case, I just throw it into the briefcase and keep it handy. Now when I'm at meetings or off doing some research, the keyboard can come right out, sit on the table and allow me to enter in info quickly (and more importantly - accurately). Those memo files can then be synced to the desktop, copied and printed or emailed as needed. An invaluable tool that lets me make one more step away from carrying paper around all the time. The keys have a great feel and the resistance is just right to let me know I'm typing what I want.My only caveat is I don't know how sturdy it will be in the long term, but it seems to be built strong. Highly Recommended!"
306,1,"Good for background music, maybe for a small gethering, but if you want to rock the party. NO.They work well outdoors and have not given any problems in the 5 years I have had them."
307,0,Nice little package with deep sound for such a small unit.  A little heavy on the bass.  But the FM reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only 2 stars.
308,0,"I have gone through three of these coolers. All with the same issues. Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans. It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long. It does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor. Go with the antec laptop cooler, excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year. The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one."
309,2,"Would have been nice to have one more long strip in this kit.  Seems they are designed to make you have to purchase additional (separate) pieces.  I had just mounted my flat screen over my fireplace and needed the cords covered.  The size worked perfectly across the top and down the sides, but I was a little short and had to improvise a bit.  It was nice the adhesive was already attached so all you have to do is remove the backing."
310,1,Seems OK but as I said it takes both plugs.  I also do not like the fact that if a surge does occur the powercenter is killed and cannot be used again.  Would a simple circuit breaker really be out of the question?
311,1,"inexpensive indoor antenna that works ok overall.  surprisingly, hooked it up to an HDTV randomly and am able to get about 20 crystal clear channels, 5 in HD, 6 in digital.  sure beats paying over $100/month for HDTV cable if you don't watch much tv.  (HD reception will depend on location, building set up, etc. of course)"
312,2,"These headphones have excellent sound quality, especially in the Bass ranges. The foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear, even after hours. It requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion, put it in your ear canal, hold it and wait for it to expand, then carefully remove hand, but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit. The dark purple plastic is a little strange, and they do look funny, but that is a very minor detail. Great product."
313,1,Nice flexible wire. My only gripe was that the last couple of feet towards the inside of the spool was slightly tarnished. I don't know if it was on the shelf for several years or if moisture contacted it before it was spooled. Used it anyway cause I needed every inch of that 100 feet.
314,2,"For the price, there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace. It's that simple."
315,2,"I bought the Sennheiser PX200 and returned them since they hurt my head (7 3/4 hat size). These headphones sound better, (better range and low end), fit better, and cover more of my ears.  Solid value."

317,1,"I did extensive research on this model (the whole ZR series) and I must say, a lot of things are positive for this little camera.* light weight, * small, * bright outdoor pictures, * PRICE.And some negative points raised by many so far, which of course I have not been able to test as I have not bought this item, is the motor noise being recorded and the night shots being grainy.I will not discuss anything about it as they have been beaten to death by now.What I want to talk about is the smaller CCD resolution on the ZR series camcorders.As we know, the US spec ZR series have the 460K pixels, out of which only 290K pixels are used for video (effective pixels). We need about 420K effective pixels to get a 500 line video resolution on the TV. Most of us know that, the VHS format (video tapes) allow upto 240lines of horizontal resolution. The S-VHS tapes allow upto 400 lines and the Digital Video format goes to 525 lines (really crisp and sharp pictures) on the TV/visual media.So now, with mere 290K effective pixels of video resolution being recorded on the ZR40/45/50, the best lines of resolution would be around 300. Now, not everything is bad. If you intend to transfer your videos into VHS tapes for storage and future viewing, you will not have any complaints as VHS tapes store at 240 lines of resolution. But someone like me, who wants to store the video digitally, by burning them into DVDs or storing them in DV tapes, I would like to get the best resolution that I can, right?In simple words, I want 500 lines of resolution for my video, full stop! Even though ZR40 is a DV camera, its resolution is very poor for real digital quality video.By the way, the resolution has got everything to do with what we call SHARP, crisp and colorful pictures. It is the same difference you see between the movies played from the VHS tape and movies played from the DVD.Oh by the way, if your TV doesn't have a 500 line horizontal resolution capability, you are not getting the money's worth by renting DVDs. The TV I bought about 4 yrs ago, a proscan 32 inch, has 700 lines of horizontal resolution. So I can assume most TVs in our houses have capable enough TVs. Going slightly off topic, do you know why the picture quality of HDTVs are so sharp? Bcoz their resolutions are almost double than the 500 lines I am talking about."
318,0,"I purchased this unit based on owning a prior Sennheiser headset.  This unit is nothing like the old one.  It is quite a bit flimsier, less comfortable, not loud enough, and the noise cancelling unit is large and unwieldy.  In addition, the power button is easy to turn on by accident and thereby drain the battery.  I will be returning it when I return from my trip."
319,2,They are a little overated do sound muddy depends on the track you listen to but highs never sound like they should.I wouldnt say there bassey but more of a swamped out muffled.You could do better if you look around but there not bad but if you own these they cant be you only pair
320,2,"It is a label that goes in a brother label printer and it works... not much else to say... so I'll tell you why it is special....1. background sticker.2. special thermal paper3. clear plastic.the thermal print head creates the letters behind the plastic - it does NOT print the letters like a normal printer and this is why the letters don't rub off.  Brilliant idea that no other label maker, to my knowledge does.CONS:The labels are expensive and I have never found and after-market generic alternative."
321,2,They sound every bit as good as my ear-surrounding headphones.  I find them much more comfortable than the now popular ear-buds.  I think they are stylish -- Geek style.
322,2,"Highly recommended on their own, and especially if you're wanting to spend less than $60 on open-air headphones (in fact, these are a LOT less than $60, almost half that).I ordered my Koss PortaPros from Amazon after having to admit the Sennheiser HD 202 phones I ordered in August 2010 were not comfortable and had muddy bass.  I wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed, and I really wanted to LOVE the HD202s.  The reviews were great, the price was great, and they are ""Sennheisers"".  All to naught.  I should have listened to my gut and heeded the few reviews that commented on the boomy bass.I had a pair of the original Koss PortaPros back in the mid 1980s and remember them very fondly.  These current PortaPros are simply great headphones.  They are clear, free from distortion, the bass is all there and punchy, not boomy or muddy in the least.The best thing I can say about headphones is that they don't just ""sound good for headphones"", they produce a very good sound.  And these Koss have great sound - really, very excellent.To be objective - I don't think I'd be quick to let a child use these.  While the build quality feels good, these aren't made for rough handling.If you want some incredibly rugged excellent-sounding budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers, mp3 players, portable DVD players, etc, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones.  I buy these 2-3 pair at a time and always have a pair or two still in the packaging ready to bring out as needed."
323,2,"A classic, ergonomic design.  These devices have been very popular for years.  But this product is long overdue for an update.  Logitech's customer forums have dozens of requests for new versions of the thumb trackball devices, but Logitech hasn't even bothered to reply in years (one customer got an email reply acknowleding that they got lots of requests for new Trackman models).This model uses antiquated 27 MHz wireless technology.  The range is very limited, and the receiver is a large, corded blob half as big as the Trackman itself.It doesn't have many of the buttons and features that most of the newer Logitech mice have.PLEASE, Logitech, listen to your loyal customers and come out with some new trackball-based devices!"
324,2,"28 years. 28 years and counting. This is how long since the Koss PortaPro was introduced, and to this day, they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since 1984. Talk about market endurance and lasting appeal. This headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry, from the cassette Walkman, to the era of MP3 players and the iPod and now, the streaming era. It's baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a feat.One probable cause is the quality to price ratio. The PortaPros have gone up in price over the years, but still, currently at $40, they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point. Koss, for the most part, is known more for their budget headphones but the PortaPro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about. These pump out sound so decent, they compare well enough against headphones way beyond  their price range! In fact, I like their sound signature so much that I use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets. They are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphones.So what is it about these cans that make them so great? Why are they revered by fans all over, sparking a rather vocal cult following?Seeing them for the first time, you might not even dare venture to try them on. They look like light, flimsy, cheap 80's headsets. (Which is in a sense, what they really are.) Some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous, it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin. ( I find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way, though. Like how sci-fi movies in the 80's imagine what future thingies will look like.)  There's a minimalist no-frills commitment to these headphones' presentation. See, there's just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin, even more plastic, grilled sound drivers, thinly wired, with black foam padding, terminating into a 3.5 mm 45 degree jack. But that same plastic mount gives the PortaPros their unique iconic look and character. It's called the ComfortZone slider and together with the metal accents, it lends the PortaPros that RoboCop/Terminator aesthetic. It was probably a gimmick back in the day because the ComfortZone settings (Light to Firm) hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting, resting the foams on my temples. The PortaPros, therefore, are known and remembered for this look and Koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic. And you don't get the PortaPros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality. They feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat. They feel so delicate and fragile that Koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty! So basically, if you buy a PortaPro now, you are set for life.At the end of the day, you get the PortaPros because of their sound characteristics. These would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties. This is why we obsess over headphones anyway. They are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing. These are honest and straight-forward consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselves.What you get with the PortaPros is surprising clarity and detail, you can't believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out. The drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect, of course.The high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy. Bass is substantial and not overpowering but, however, could get loose in the higher bass frequencies. This low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality. The proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness. Technically, with these faults, you could argue that these shouldn't sound good, but all in all, when you combine these traits, it's actually a pleasurable listening experience.I think, coupled with their specific sound signature, what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation. Since they are technically open back sets, the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance, giving them this feathery, airy feel.  Instrument separation, as a consequence, is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out. Of course, there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better, but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the PortaPro's price point then the sound difference will be life changing. Like I said, these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price. Some people compare the PortaPros to another open back can, the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone or theGrado Prestige Series SR-60i Padded Headphones, but nothing could be more different. These Grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people. The PortaPros are tuned more as balanced sets, if not bass focused, what with their slightly forward mids.  Both these Grados and the PortaPros are brilliant entry-level sets , although the SR80i are twice as expensive. I use the PortaPros, appropriately enough,  more for 80's synth pop, rock and new wave while I prefer the Grados for acoustic guitar recordings, and  if you must, do get both.So in summary, the iconic PortaPros are a 20th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal. Their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following. If you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank, then get yourself the PortaPros now!"
325,0,"I received my lens quickly in the mail and of course immediately started playing with it as soon as I got it. First off, the motor is INCREDIBLY loud. Secondly, it wouldn't focus in auto mode and continued to distort the colors. I don't know if this is just me or this is true for everyone. It was usable on manual focus and I had to keep playing with the exposure settings and white balance for it to expose correctly and be true to color. Keep in mind this was with the same environment. The pictures I got after all these adjustments were nice but I'd sooner save the 100 bucks and put it towards upgrading to the USM motor. Unfortunately, mine is going back immediately."
326,0,"After reading the mixed reviews on Amazon, I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase this USB2 hub. Oh man o man o man... I have had problem, after problem, after PROBLEM with this thing.First off, if ALL OF YOUR DEVICES ARE NOT USB2, it will revert to usb1. For USB1 purposes, it's decent.Secondly, I am experiencing massive and sporadic incompatibility issues with my 2.5"" hard drives, Canon PIXMA 4000 printer, etc.I have never ever had any other problems with USB hubs, so I assumed this would be a decent experience, but it's been a nightmare"

328,2,I bought this CB radio for my Jeep.  I use it when I am wheeling with my Jeepin' buddies and it works very well.  I like how I can plug it into my Jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the go.
329,1,"I got this mouse for an iMac (Core 2 Duo) because reading all the information and reviews told me: this is the mouse for me. However, this mouse is not what I was expecting. So allow me to comment on any ides you might get from other reviews and the software description.I thought it would be quiet. The main mouse buttons and scroll button are medium-medium-quiet (which isn't very bad, but I wanted quiet). But the side option buttions are LOUD.I thought it would be pretty comfortable for my medium-small hands. It isn't bad, but it is kind of tall at the center (the hump is in the middle) and a little wide.The software was no good. It installed fine on my Mac OS X 10.4.10, but it wouldn't open the preferences it installed in the System Preferences. It said I needed to update the software, which was especially funny since mid-install it asked me if I wanted to download and install a newer version (which turned out to download 2.5), and I did. I had to go to their website and download 3.0, which worked. However, I did not like the configuration of the buttons, and there was no option to make the side buttons do Expos&eacute;. It also put an ugly icon of a mouse inside a gear at the top of the menubar (next to the time) which let you know if the single-direction scroll wheel was set to go up-down or right-left. Guess what? Clicking the scroll wheel changes this back and forth, which means no more opening and closing tabs in my web browser with that button. I decided to un-install the software, and now it acts more like a regular Mighty Mouse (excluding the sideways scrolling).A minor (or not so minor?) thing is that the mouse cord has lead, and it says ""wash hands after handling""! Wash my hands every time I touch the mouse wire? Why don't they just use regular rubber or something?Another minor thing, scrolling the middle wheel a little (so it doesn't actually scroll a notch) makes a sound like the wheel is loose.Finally, the optical sensor which gives the mouse its location doesn't work on all surfaces it should. I work on a white table that has a kind of matte reflection, and for some reason I cannot find, the mouse doesn't work properly over the part of the table I usually use; I have to use a mouse pad! A funny thing is that a Logitech mouse I have which doesn't work on a raw wood desk (in the same way this one doesn't work on my white table) does work on the white table, and this Kensington mouse does work on the wood table. (The Apple Might Mouse works on both surfaces.)So, in summary, it is a decent mouse, but it has many areas that need improvement in order for me to consider it a mouse I would recommend or buy again.UPDATE: After less than two years, the cord on this mouse has become unreliable. At certain angles, the connection breaks and I have to jiggle it around before the mouse resumes working. I'm stuck back with the bluetooth Apple Might Mouse. My new rating would be two stars for a two-year lifespan."
330,0,The base is not the standard size to go on a tripod. It is a smaller bolt size and will not go on a monopod or Sima Tripod. I did not return item due to low cost. Maybe someday I will have a tripod it will fit.  The product description did not say not standard thread.

332,0,"Either it was damaged in shipping, or I got a defective lens.  For whatever reason, the picture quality on any photo taken on this lens (with every setting, stop, is on/off, tested) came out blurry, particularly on the left side.  Photos taken with my old stock 18-55 lens were dramatically clearer.  The zoom range was decent, but I'm disappointed.  Sending this lens back.  It didn't even come with a manual.  I was really looking forward to a lens upgrade.---Update -I reordered the same lens from the same folks and, surprise, this one came in a real Canon lens box with manual and everything.  Clearly the one I sent originally was not brand new.  Be advised, if you don't get a manual and a canon box, you're getting sent something that someone else returned.  That said, the new lens is beautiful.  The shots are crisp and even using it for a few pictures, it's pretty awesome and the best lens I have.If I could, I'd change my rating from 1 star to 4.  For the hassle I went through returning the bad lens, I have to take away a star."
333,0,"I recently purchased a 50 pack of the TDK music audio CD-R's as well as a memorex 50 pack. The memorex worked great, 100% usable. The TDK not so much. So far I am seeing about 90% failure rate. Either my CR recorder (Philips brand) can't recognize it, or if it does, it won't finalize it after recording. Would not recommend these to anyone. However, different recorders react differently. Mine doesn't like the TDK brand. Recommend buying a single CD-R or two and trying out before investing in a whole spindle of coasters."
334,0,"The driver for this mouse caused my Dell Vista system to freeze repeatedly, which it had never, ever done before. I put my old Dell mouse back on but the system kept freezing. I called the support number in the mouse software help screen to get advice on how to uninstall the software, but it referred me to a new number for paid support at 9.99 per call. So I hunted up a Microsoft support number and got an overseas call center. I spoke with three agents, all of whom insisted that the Product ID number on the back of my mouse had insufficient digits - 20 digits vs the 16 my mouse carried. Lacking a valid PID number they refused to connect me with free tech support, but only offered me paid support. I've waited a LONG time to speak with a supervisor...  As I write this I've been on the phone to MS for a full hour with no help at all. I'm still on hold. Where will it end?  Oh! 28 minutes into the call the line went dead. I guess that's Microsoft's commitment to customer service in action. Now I'm on the phone to MS itself, via the corporate number I got from google finance. They're concerned that the PID lacks digits, but they've finally told me how to uninstall this. Total time on the phone was 1 hour and 22 minutes. Now to call Amazon to return this Chinese-made piece of junk....  UPDATE: Microsoft speculated that the mouse was counterfeit, owing to its not having a valid product ID number. So that's fun. Returning the wretched thing to amazon turned out to be wonderfully simple. Wouldn't you like to know before you order what country these things are made in?"
335,0,"This is, quite simply, an unvarnished Nikon rip-off. I bought an identical version of this release cable on eBay for eight bucks, shipping included! See link below. Nikon seems to think that once you have bought one of their cameras, you are forever locked in to buying their expensive accessories exclusively. A previous reviewer was quite right. It's just an expensive hunk of Nikon plastic.[...]"
336,2,"You get 3 strips of plastic which can each hold about 3 'cable-size' wires. The strips have a self adhesive back to attach on the wall/floor. It also comes with a few 'elbows' and connectors which is nice. only downside, that cutting the strip short was a bit difficult.  Otherwise a good product and delivered as always on time and quickly by Amazon.  Be prepared for it to be shipped in a larger than expected box (some 6-7' long..)."
337,2,"I first bought this transmitter as an alternative to the pocket wizards. Most of the work I do with this transmitter is outdoors. Greats pretty good outdoors, even if both, the flash and the receiver are under direct sunlight (flash has fired every single time). Of course, since it is an infrared wireless trigger system, the only limitation you have is that the flash has to be in front or above the camera to be triggered. Outdoors, you have to be within a horizontal  working distance of 10-15 feet, and you can be about 30 feet away from the flash within the horizontal working distance (although most of us, will be working within 12 feet of our subject). I would highly recommended. i even got to use it with an umbrella directly in front of the flash, and the flash could still be triggered without any problems."
338,0,"I bought this thinking since its expensive, it will be better. but I plugged it in and the red light came on, I read the manual and it said if the red light comes on you need to change the wiring at your house(which I didnt have time nor money for it) then I threw it away and bought a cheap one which is working perfect."
339,0,"We got one of these some years ago for about $130, and though that seemed a bit steep, this has been a swell little radio: easy to carry around the house, goes a long time on a charge, sounds good for its size.But $220??? What changed to make it cost $90 more? So 5 stars for performance, but 2 stars due to plain greed on the part of the manufacturer."
340,0,I was a little surprised with how flimsy these were and how average the sound was.  I would not buy again
341,0,"I bought this product because I use them on my macs so I figured stick with dlink on this but what a mistake , the driver is a total disaster! it loads generic drivers then it complains about a security code then if you get that all worked out the driver will then declare you do not have a valid license! This thing is useless in windows! That driver is a joke! Seriously do not buy this for windows it will not work!"
342,2,"Decent amount of options, good lens quality, but do wish it had exposure compensation and spot metering, I've found many lighting situations where this camera could have used those features. Also wish the lens were a little wider angle so found a used Canon Z90W."
343,0,"I wish I had read some of the reviews here before buying this program. It looked great, very nice design, lots of options. A few crashes here and there, but I've learned to save often. The real problems come in when you try and burn a DVD. Its really bad at only burning part of your DVD, which causes your movie to stop in the middle. Adjusting brightness can lead to an black screen on final DVD burn. Still images, which you lay titles over etc, all get lost when you save your project and reopen it.Its too bad, the layout and design is just awesome. I had such high hopes when I read through it. I hope they can fix some of this for the next release, since this version is nearly useless."
344,2,"I have been using my Palm VIIx about a week now and definitely like it. As a deaf individual, the wireless email is as close as I can get to being on an equal footing with cell phone users. The service plans offered by Palm.net actually appear to be cheaper than service plans offered by Skytel.com for their Motorola text paging devices. The ideal solution for me would be a cell phone costing not more than $50 with a monthly service plan of not more than $10 and no data transfer charges. It would send and recieve text messages and surf the web anywhere in the world and talk to any wireless network, anywhere, for exactly the same price. We don't have price/performance like that yet. So I took the VIIx because I was impatient for wireless email. Now I have a minimally frustrating way of getting in touch with family while I'm on the road. It's really nice being able to carry all 427 of my contacts and a few tons of notes in a 6 ounce package. Is it worth my [$]? I am willing to pay that much just for the wireless email. (wireless web clippings appear to be well beyond my financial means at this time.) As for the rest of the device I don't know its true worth to me yet and suspect I  will not for several more months.Linux users, you can HotSync a Palm to a Linux machine. Look for the pilot-link software for your distribution and be sure to check the O'Reilly web site for their Palm articles. Pilot-link, however, is focused on a serial HotSync connection. How about a little USB software too? There is for Red Hat users, but it is not targeted expressly for the Palm. If you have Red Hat 7.0 look carefully in your kernel sources for a module named visor.c. Open it in emacs and you'll discover it is USB-support code for HotSyncing a HandSpring Visor. Methinks with just a little work it can be ported to the Palm also, since the 2 devices use the Palm OS.The Palm VIIx has fairly severe limitations:1. The Hotsync cradle ought to ship as USB hardware with a true USB interface just as the Handspring devices do. My desktop computer only has one free serial port and that is in use for my modem. (That's a tipoff that I'm a Linux user.) Few new computers have more than one RS-232 (serial) port. Old computers had 2 or 3, but new ones usually give you just one and a bunch of USB ports. Since a serial cradle ships standard, I may have to spend another $40 for the USB connector. (I'm thinking I might be able to go to CompUSA and pick up a serial port card for a lot less than the Palm USB kit. Is there such a card? Hmmm.) I think a USB option should be offered to Palm users free.2. It should be easy to connect to a home network but is not. The VIIx is just another computing device. If you can hook it into a Windows or Linux based network, either with an ethernet cable connection or wirelessly, you can surf the web on a (far cheaper) landline connection without needing Palm.net. Palm OS 3.5.2 has TCP/IP code for making network connections. The interfaces Palm documents are through a serial (PPP, SLIP or CSLIP) connection. That means a hardware-based connection. I can assign the device an IP address or it can use DHCP. I should also be able to assign a hostname like 'bobspalm.lingpgmr.com'. But wait a minute! I'd like to sit down on my sofa (with a strong overhead light) and literally tap the VIIx into a wireless network connection to my home network. That must be possible because the handbook documents how to change the IP address of the proxy server, and there is now or soon will be wireless ethernet connectivity hardware available for the home.I should have a relatively easier time turning the Palm into a PPP-based network client in Linux than in Windows. But I would still be tied to the Hotsync cradle instead of relaxing on my easy chair and checking my stock account.3. The Palm OS seems brain-damaged. For example I can only have ShortCuts of up to 45 characters in length each. Why that limitation? Why not 1K or more to each ShortCut? That way I can use ShortCuts to help fill in boilerplate text entries in DateBook or my To Do's. I'm limited to how many categories I can have as well. Why impose such arbitrary limitations? I might need 80 or 100 or 250 or 500 categories. The person next door might need 1250. That's flexibility. Memos and Notes are limited to 1K in length each. If you sync to Outlook 2000, an Outlook Note can be 32K long. There goes your notes if they are longer than 1K. Contacts in Outlook 2000 can have a large number of fields such as &quot;Nickname&quot; that the conduit will throw away no matter how badly I want access to them. What happens then? You suddenly find yourself reinventing the wheel, spending your valuable time paring existing data to fit the handheld platform when it really ought to be exactly the other way around: the handheld should accept whatever is thrown at it from the desktop application so that you can press that button and go. Instead of finding yourself with a mirror image of a desktop database you have 2 very different databases and each requires time to customize. What a waste. I think this is the fault of the Palm OS and very shortsighted design decisions. If you must reinvent the wheel someone was stupid somewhere.4. I agree with all the other complaints made by others. The screen especially is very hard to see and use. I hate the greyscales and the reflectiveness of the screen and the difficulty of writing Grafitti. You have to be really determined to enter a lot of text using Grafitti.Complaints like these plus the presence of the Handspring platform may work to bring some humility to the Palm folks and convince them to make the Palm much more user and network friendly. If you are considering buying this device, waiting a year or so might not be a bad idea."
345,1,"sent me the wrong cable. Apparently, the one in picture no longer being made. They sent me something else. A complete false advertisement. Never buy again."
346,0,"This product is just below average if you ask me, and I have never been thrilled with its performance.  You get what you pay for."
347,0,"If you want a switch, then, don't buy this, because it product terrible output pictures,tons of shaking. What is the point if a switch does not product the same picture to start with? It creates a problem by solving one. I hate product like this."
348,1,I had a very difficult time keeping the earbuds in my ears.  My ear openings aren't that small.  I'd say they're average in size and these earbuds kept falling out.  Could be because they're flat rather than being cone shaped or having different sizes to fit the different size ears. I just found them difficult to use.  The best thing I liked about them is the in-line volume control.
349,0,"Just because its a BOSE you tend to think that they sound better.  Indeed if you go to a BestBuy store, where there is lot of ambient noise and try these haedphones you perceive it to sound better.  But return home and then compare them with other cheaper headphones and you will find that the BOSE is not tremendous after all.I listened with these headphones for 3 weeks and returned them because I eventually found that I got more satisfaction from the cheaper Sennheiser HD 202 headphone for which I had paid only 20$ at Amazon whereas the BOSE cost me almost 160$ including taxes.So please don't go just by brand name.  Trust your ears and not your eyes because you are going to listen through your ears and not eyes.  Forget the BOSE symbol on your headphone and compare them to any other headphone that you previously own.  They will sound as good.  Don't waste your money on this product.The audio is too loud.  The treble is too high pitching and almost pains your ears after some time.  The bass is reduced, that's the reason, it does not blur even at high volumes.  Overall mediocre sound"
350,2,This Koss is very good one for volume control. There is no noise sound when I adjust volume. I can't distinguish whether I plug my headphone with this Koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all. I use HD555 which has 50 ohms impedance so I think this Koss may reduce some power of my headphone. But not at all. My HD555 still provides great sound. I love it.
351,2,"As a replacement eye cup.....perfect.  But, do not expect it to have a diopter or any form of lens, it doesn't.  Being used on a Canon 60D, I also purchased a 'special' diopter to supplement the original equipment diopter.  In reality, I didn't need to, but now, I have a spare.  In other words, you can add a 'special' diopter lens without the need to purchase this."
352,2,saw this case in a camera store and it was exactly what i wanted except for the price. looked around online and found this one at a fairprice and purchased it. very good quality with enough pockets and seperators to keep all you need at a monents grasp.
353,2,"I've had a history with Koss, and they provide such amazing sound quality!Two tips:1. Take care of them or they will get destroyed.2. Try to keep them in your room (or they will get destroyed)."
354,2,"I was seeking new headphones to replace my iPod nano headphones which are pathetic. I had some Koss earbud headphones that I loved but lost, so I needed new ones. So I came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the PortaPro were great. Since I had a great experience with Koss in the past (they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free, no questions asked), I decided to try these. The reviews are right-on.I'd describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers you've ever heard were on both sides of your head. The sound is great at all volumes. The clarity is such that I can hear parts of songs that I never heard before. The lows, mids, and highs are perfect. Some headphones sound bad at high volumes, and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear. Well you don't get that with these. It's like you're in the studio recording with the band. You can tell the difference between a 160kbps, 192kbps, and a 256kbps mp3 file with these headphones. The only thing I don't like about them is that I can hear outside noise, like cars whizzing by (a good thing, I guess) or the engine on the bus. This can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume up.The headphones look big because of the ""headrests"" they have, but  they are ergonomic. I was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because I didn't feel them on my head. They have three comfort settings: light, medium, and firm. They also come with a little case which is nice. The phones fold up to the size of a baseball, and both speakers fold inward. A small clip exists on the bottom of each phone, which attaches both sides together when you fold them. You then wrap the cord up and go. They can fit into a typical pocket. These are portable headphones, and I don't know why people say otherwise.They are some of the best headphones I've ever heard. No surprise Koss makes them. They are also manufactured in the USA so there is no outsourcing of jobs with these phones. I can understand why these phones have been on the market since the 1980s. They're fantastic."
355,0,Do not get this lens if you plan to use it for video.  Very low and jerky motor when focusing.  I actually found it a little too loud even when shooting stills.  I decided to return it and spend the extra money for the f/1.4 50mm instead.  I've been much more happy with it:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009XVCZ/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1
356,0,This is a old school gadget that no longer works well in modern age. It did not work as it should. The Co. and Amazon both were nice about it and took it back. Did not work for me. If you get it make sure its worth it. You may want something more current or a better cell phone with the same options.
357,2,"I've had this camera for about 3 years now.Picture quality:- takes great pictures outdoors, and indoor pictures with adequate lighting.- flash is not adequate.  pictures with flash are horrible.  they come out all blurry - the shutter speed isn't fast enough/CCD not good enough (when using auto settings)Use:- I like having the ability to change the f-stop setting on the fly with the knob on top of the camera.  Sure beats using the menus.- The battery lasts a long time, but it's always good to have a spare, especially if you use LCD alot.Construction:- Solid.- I've fallen on this thing while skiing (back of case is cracked) and took it with me when I accidentally fell into Lake Tahoe (camera was submerged), but amazingly it still works.Summary:I've taken thousands of pictures with the camera.  Certainly got good use out of it over the past 3 years.However, newer cameras have better flash capability and record in video.  My friends have the Canon SXXX series.  They are 1/2 the size of the Kodak, and perform much better."
358,0,"The same that I wrote for the Sewell. Insufficient instructions for use. Better than the Sewell, as it should be since it cost twice as much."
359,2,"Best sounding open ear headphones I've ever heard. I've used them almost every day for a long time. Bass is very powerful for something that doesn't enclose the ear. Sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power. As others have said, the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally, but that is the only complaint I have."
360,0,"I bought the DI-514 because I wanted to have a wi-fi router and it was only $20.  What a mistake.  First, if WEP (encryption) is turned on, wi-fi simply does not work.  I've tested this with three laptops and two Pocket PCs.  Wi-fi does work with WEP turned off, but it's painfully slow, and keeps dropping the connection.Second, the router's firewall cannot be configured, even though the documentation says so and there's an area in the ""advanced"" configuration that supposedly lets you set specific firewall rules.  No luck.  I set the rules and tried everything, but the firewall was still blocking my applications.  Very frustrating.  The website support is just terrible, with lots of errors in their knowledge database.I'll never buy anything from D-Link again.  My previous router (a Microsoft) was easy to set up and worked like a charm.  I shouldn't have given it to my dad... should have just bought another one."
361,2,"I received the Palm M100 for Christmas of 2000 and it proved very useful until the fall of 2005, when it suddenly began to have the same problem reported by other reviewers: it began draining batteries very quickly and could not hold information while changing batteries (I would have to reload all my backed up data every time I changed batteries.) I am usually on the road so this created a problem, unless I replaced my desktop with a laptop.To make a long story short, I trashed the old Palm and bought a used one to replace it for fifteen dollars, and when I replaced my PC with anApple iMac G5 Desktop with 17"" M9843LL/A (1.8 GHz PowerPC G5, 512 MB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD-RW Drive), the Palm made the transition well, after I added aKeyspan High Speed USB Serial Adapter  ( USA-19HS ).Would I buy another? It depends on price: It has an inherent flaw, but I found a replacement quickly and for a good price. It serves my needs, I can concentrate on my work because don't have to learn to use another device, and it works well. Moreover, my first Palm worked well for nearly five years, which is pretty good for an electronic device that got carted all over the country multiple times.Last, because the Palm is ""outdated"", there are many accessories that can now be purchased for pennies on the dollar, such as thePalmOne m100 Series Slim Leather Carrying Case, and colorul faceplates like thePalmOne m100 series Faceplate Cover (Pacific Blue)."

363,2,"What can I say about wire ties?  These are really good for the price.  Have you ever priced these in the store??  I don't expect to use these outside in the weather, or to withhold a lot of pressure, so these will work just fine for my purpose.."
364,1,Good enough for the bedroom but sound does not travel well.  Bass is very weak even on a decent denon receiver.

366,2,"This item arrived on time and in good condition.  I have several VHS players, and this is a must for me.  Very easy to use to get great results without having to open up the VHS unit to clean it, though I still do once in a while just to visually check the bands.  This works as good as the wet type head cleaner, but without the hassle of adding drops into the head cleaner tape.  I recommend this head cleaner.  I give this a 5 star rating because this is the simpliest way to clean the video and audio heads of a VHS."
367,0,This has been extremely unreliable. It loses WAN connection frequently( within minutes). Sometimes it is connected but will not pass any DNS traffic. Even resetting does not help. Stay away from it.Update: This is completely dead now. Even the ethernet ports are dead.
368,0,"Got this refurbished from Costco.  Good screen etc.  BUT, the power runs out every time you turn your back on it and there IS NO BACKUP (watch-type) battery.  When the power runs out, you LOSE every program you ever installed, and the software walks you through an insultingly stupid nano-tutorial before you can use it again.  Stupid design of the decade.  Bought a stowaway keyboard for it and whenever the keyboard got near it, the Ipaq got flaky.  Tonight the thing died again and I destroyed it (dead, it makes a better work of art than it ever did a PDA).  Reason:  I had to spend more time and effort reviving it than using it.  A great concept with severely crappy reliability."
369,0,"Worked just fine for a few months, then it died.  This was my third one.  I gave up and went with an Ethernet wired connection.  I do NOT recomnmend this.  Only needed on an older laptop.  Its really outdated for the ones manufactured today."
370,0,"This cable is just what I needed! It's awesome!There are, however, a few things to note:-Seems to be well-constructed (only time will tell)-Little tough to get headphone connector to go in, but no real biggy-Six feet seems to go a little longer than you may think, it's probably somewhere relative to your height (I only mention thisbecause I sometimes have a little trouble visualizing length of cables, so I hope this helps others who think the same way)Over all, I'm very well pleased. This cable seems to be worth more than a penny, but I'm not going to argue about that!UPDATE (12/12/10): This cable stopped working a few days ago. If it was touched, then all you could hear was static. If it wasn't positioned correctly, you could only hear one speaker. Obviously, I think it's a waste of money looking back since it failed."
371,2,"Am using the car charger with a Garmin eTrex Legend and it works just like it should.  I can use it on car trips without worrying about the batteries running down (Be aware that it does NOT charge the batteries, just powers the Garmin so the batteries are not used.  A separate battery charger is needed.)  Main complaint is that the charger is specific to only my Garmin eTrex and that all companies are doing the same thing.  Presently I have to travel with a charger for the Garmin, one for my cellphone and another for my iPod.  As a result I own six chargers; three for the car and three for the wall. And add three more cables for connecting each to the PC."

373,1,"Sounds great for the cost, and at least appears to be durable. But, despite being of average size in this department the earcups are too small. Can't be worn for any period of time. Also, could use some kind of cord-management system-- cord is too long for use with shirt-pocket MP3 player."
374,2,"There's a large market for headphones in the $20 to $40 price range, and this set is among the best.The earcups rest comfortably against the side of your head without pressing into your ear at all. I find that I can wear these headphones for hours on end without getting sore ears, which would happen with several other similarly-priced headphones I have tried.The level of sound blocking done by these earcups is phenomenal. You can wear them without even plugging them in and enjoy a significant reduction in ambient noise. This also adds to the quality of sound you get when listening to music, particularly in noisier environments.My only complaint is the volume knob in the cord. The knob sticks out symmetrically from both sides of the plastic housing, so it's impossible to tell which direction to rotate it to increase or decrease the volume without either trying and listening, or looking at the black-on-black markings, which are very hard to see.These work great with an iPod, I find that leaving the headphone volume knob turned up all the way (which essentially means that it's passing the signal through without dampening it) and the iPod around half volume is a comfortable listening level."
375,1,"This is a rather basic player, but it does play MP3's from folders and subfolders and allows you to navigate around to find the song you like to hear.But I've been having some problems reading some of my MP3 discs. I'm not sure if it's my CD writer, the MP3 file itself or this player. The MP3 songs will play for the first 10 seconds, and stops dead. The very same disc will play no problem on my pc.And because it uses a non-standard sized power jack, I couldn't use my existing portable CD power adaptor for it even though it is the same voltae and polarity. I view this as a disadvantage because I already have the home and car power supplies for my other portable CD players.There're other &quot;noname&quot; brands out there that could play MP3, WMA, VCDs and even has FM/AM radio built-in for slightly more. With the glitches I've experienced, the only thing that's still good about this player is the Rio brandname (which by the way has already been sold, now known as Sonic Blue)."
376,2,"I got the camera today and proceeded to try it out both at work and at home. I had no problems whatsoever setting up the drivers and software either on my iMac at work or on my Win98 machine at home. The camera's really easy to use, the only possible drawback is that all the menu items appear as tiny little icons on the LCD screen - perhaps not a good choice for those with bad eyesight. We've been taking pictures all night, and everything seems to be working out fine. Obviously, I haven't tested it in all possible conditions, and I know that battery life will be an issue. I did a lot of shopping around, and this really did seem like the best bang for the buck. ...I'd definitely recommend looking around on the web, taking your time, reading reviews, and deciding what you'd like out of a digital camera. If, however, you're a novice user, would like something that's easy to set up and equally easy to use, I'd definitely recommend the Finepix 1300. The USB interface is quite speedy, it's lightweight and portable, and picture quality is pretty good. I'd think about purchasing some rechargable batteries, a carrying case (there's no lens cap), and perhaps a wall adapter (especially if you'll be using it for Ebay or something like that). Anice beginner's digital camera, with a lot of good deals out there if you look around."
377,1,"I'm disappointed with this system.  I got it to replace my Creative GigaWorks T3 2.1.  Not because I was unhappy with the Creative system, but because I got the impression the Klipsh would be *that* much better than it.  One of the big reasons was that the Creative system's subwoofer is fairly low watts, and I'm a bass-head.  The thing is, though, the Creative subwoofer, whatever the wattage is, produced super clean, super deep, rich booms!Well I got the Klipsch and unpacked it.  My first disappointment was that the satellites are connected by connecting stripped speaker wire to screw terminals on the sub.  Not a huge deal, but less clean that a plug-in system.  Next I noticed the satellites are roughly 3-4 times the size of the Creative satellites.  Of course I expected them to produce even more than the Creative system, and so I wasn't concerned.After wiring it up I went to go turn the system on, expecting some control on the left speaker, but found none.  Did a bit of research, there's no way to turn these damn things off other than unplugging the entire system.  Yeah, ridiculous.  So to unplug it from the your computer you have to turn the volume all the way down to silence the crackle it makes.So I've got the system wired up and am ready to hear the mind boggling sound.  Turn it all on, and it sounds marginally better than my awesome Creative system it was sitting right to.  And!?!  It sounded marginally better than the Creative system.  I mean _marginally_."
378,0,"First off, the router works fine for normal consumer use.  It was easy to install and was as simple as any other Linksys product I have purchased and setup (I have owned the BEFW11S4 for nearly 4 years, I have version 1).  The range and speed are great.HOWEVER!!!!!!!If you wish to use this router with static IP addresses (or static PPOE) it is impossible.  There are forums after forums complaining about the same thing I will tell you below.I recently bought a Dell PowerEdge 2850 for an online music lyrics website I am starting and purchased the WRT54G as well.  The BEFW11S4 simply doesn't offer any type of UPNP setup which is required for remote assistance.Shortly after setting up the WRT54G I realized that there are no adjustable WAN settings.  Supposedly it ""automatically"" configures to your WAN.  Well that is probably all hunky dorey if you are a normal consumer however when you are trying to set a specific IP address for the WRT54G to use to connect to the internet, it creates a problem.Furthermore, the router is not user friendly regarding the opening of ports that are necessary for setting up a web server (i.e. port 80 for HTTP, Port 21 for FTP, Port 3389 for Remote Assistance, etc.).  It allows you to DMZ however doing that simply opens up an entire can of security worms that no one wants to mess with.So what do I recommend instead? The D-Link DI-624 router.  Why?  Because not only does it allow you to manually set just about anything you can think of, it even gives examples of how to setup a web server and which set of settings you will need to do so.  It is EXTREMELY easy.  Don't worry it also offers the ""Wizard"" to help the normal consumer.I was a very very very loyal Linksys fan, but this D-Link has me changing my mind.Hope the review was helpful for all you folks trying to setup your own site."
379,2,"I purchased the Tamrac 5694 bag for my Canon S45 digital camera.  The bag is a little too big for my camera.  However, by using the recommendation of another reviewer of stuffing a sock into the bottom of the bag, I was able to ensure a snug fit around my camera.  The bag has little pockets for the compact flash and memory.  The top of the bag is fastened by a clip and Velcro on the front face of the bag.  The fastening method does secure the camera in the bag, but I would hesitate to put any loose items in with the camera since the top flap could easily let unsecured items slip out of the bag.  Overall, a good bag, but a zipper around the top would have been more appropriate."
380,0,"This is my first wireless Router. I like the freedom that it gives me. I can take my laptop anywhere in my home,on the porch and even down the block. It does seem to need rebooting more than my wired router but, I'm getting good at reseting it. It disconnects all the time. I would NOT recommend this router to others."
381,2,"This thing is mainly useful for bulb exposures (you have to manually lock the shutter and unlock it when you have completed the exposure time, it doesnt count the time since it doesnt have any procesors or logical electronics inside). Another thing it may work great is to be taking pictures with the camera mounted on a tripod when you dont want to move it even by the shutter button being pushed.It works just great for those two things. The remote has a shape to make easy to roll the cable around it in the bottom has a little hole to ""connect"" the cable so that it can be stored without the cable going everywhere, its kinda clever. I would recommend this product if this is what you want it for and if you dont want to spend much."
382,2,"OK, mine just showed up in the mail, so some thoughts:1.  Let's start with the sound.  It sounds great, but the earphones do suck, and the volume is too low.  I knew the earphones would suck, though, so I replaced them with some Sennheiser 495s, which sound fabulous.  On the volume thing, I think it may have to do with safety -- you're not supposed to blast headphones, and this unit will not let you.2.  The thing does not skip.3.  It does not play all mp3s perfectly.  Now, I get all my mp3s at 128 bps over Napster (but not for long!) whether this has to do with the quality of mp3s I'm getting or not, I don't know.  I create my discs with Easy CD Creator, which the unit seems to handle just fine.4.  The display is fine.  s far as not displaying the name of the song, what CD player does this?  I think we're getting a little spoiled here.5.  The display does not look cheap.6.  When these things actually get down to what they should cost -  about 60 bucks -- this thing will rock.  Until then, its an expensive toy."
383,2,"Purchased this to replace my $10 Sony ear buds. Sony is not bad, but sounds a little dry and boring. I was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a PC. Bass sounds more natural (not over emphasized as woofers do), and mid-range sounds fuller. Yo-Yo Ma sounds better with this compare to Sony.Even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones, I still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while. I think it is the case for almost any headphone.However, this is not the best for conversation. I prefer my cheapo ear bud for Skype, which sounds a lot clearer. This is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud's frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources.By the way, I got a chance to try a Koss TD-80. This Portapro beats TD hands down in sound quality. If you enjoy music, but not on an AM radio or very compressed files, give this a try.Update: to improve the clarity in conversation (Skype) or vocal, I cut a hole in the center of the foam pad. Now everything works beautifully. By the way, its cheaper to order replacement pads through Amazon. Koss charges $5 for a pair, while Amazon sells a pack for the same price."
384,0,"The speakers work good.  But then you plug in your headphones, and the volume drops way down.  You have to have the volume all the way up to use headphones... and then... if you unplug them look out!  crazy loud."
385,0,"These items are very thin. I purchased because I tried to install a new PCI network switch I had on hand in a new Windows 7 64bit computer, just to find out it was not compatible with Window 7 64bit.I then needed to purchase a replacement and got a PCI Express card instead. I never use the built in network cards due to all of the lightning in my area. Would rather risk blowing a network card and reduce the chances of main board damage. At least you have a 50/50 shot of only damaging the card. Not always helpful but sometimes it works out.Anyway my new computer had the type of mounting where you can not put screws in the filler plates or any add on card to lock them in place, you can just put the cap over the cards and plates to hold them in place.With this item being so thin it just rattled around in the slot opening and if you just touch it, it will fall out.It you can screw your plates in place these may be ok but if you can not I suggest more a more solid product or find the kind that will clip in the hole and not require any thing else to hold it in place."
386,0,"First, the CD had no files on it, so I had to download a driver from their site.  It installed OK and showed a working port, but would not communicate to either of my devices.  An old adapter works fine on this PC, so I returned it."
387,2,"The Tamrac System 3 camera bag is perfect for SLR owners who also have one or two compact lenses (e.g., the typical 28-200mm or 70-300mm zoom lens) in addition to the lens attached to the camera, plus a small external flash.  The bag is small compared to other SLR gadget bags, but the inside can be partitioned in flexible ways.  It's also well-padded, both inside and outside.  It also has lining pockets for things like USB cables, camera body cap, lens caps, filters, etc.  At the front, there's a compartment for miscellaneous items such as film, memory cards, pens, lens cleaning paper, etc.  Hidden behind this is a pull-out pouch for batteries and memory cards, plus an ID tag (kinda hard to write on, though).  You can also use the compartment this pouch is in to store film, etc, although stuff might fall out if you are not careful.  At the back is another compartment, which I use to store the manual of my Nikon D70.As you can see, this ""small"" bag is very versatile.  In addition, you can get Tamrac's add-on pouches and pockets to attach to the strap or the sides of the bag, for additional storage.I looked at many bags before settling on this one.  It's compact and weighs about 1.5 pounds, so it's material enough to withstand tough conditions yet light enough for shoulder-use.  As I mentioned it's also well padded and can accommodate extensions.  If you are the typical SLR enthusiast with a total of 2-3 compact lenses and/or a small flash unit, you'll find this bag a very good fit for your needs."
388,0,Does not work on Windows 8. Emailed TRENDnet Support and they replied with &#34;Sorry&#34; I will be returning it and get one that does work on 7&8 since i have both OS.
389,2,"I gave these 5 stars because the price of $6 !! They are somewhat heavy on the bass side but thats ok with me since its not overkill and you can always adjust the bass with an EQ. I did not read any of the reviews before buying them as they were cheap enough, but now im amazed at how good they sound. I wont tell you these are great, just letting you know they are a good to try. I also liked the KSC75's which for a few $$ more are another great buy and sound better but are clip-on (over ear) style."
390,0,"Been a long time waiting for the opportunity to get this zoom lens based on reviews.  It's my first L series lens and once received was horribly disappointed in the results.  Based on the number of others who have shared they had excellent sharp results (even hand-held), I must have received a poor quality lens.  The build date was Aug 2011 according to the stamp on the lens.  Testing from 100m to 400m on and off a tripod, all results were soft or out of focus.  My Canon D60 kit lens (18-135mm) produces much sharper images than this professional L series lens.  I am returning for refund as I'm a bit leery now of trying for a replacement.  I sure hope this isn't the quality of all newer builds with this particular lens."
391,2,I like this remote a lot - nice to be able to be in the pictures without having to use the 10-second delay.  My only issue is that the remote must be in the line of sight with the camera's sensor.  It would be nice to be able to trigger a shot from the side of the camera in certain situations.
392,1,"Well, I just got these headphones. First test was with Camels ""a nod and a wink"". Wow! they sound excellent, rich tight bass not muddy or boomy, smooth highs never shrill or distorted. Crystal clear vocals. Really exceptional sound for 27.00 and had I paid more, I would still be happy regarding sonic quality. Now the down side. I have a very small head and these still fit so snug that it hurts my ears. I cant imagine anyone with a medium to large head being able to wear them. Unless my ears are just out of wack somehow.  If the comfort level increases for me...i'll come back and add a star. If they fit you well, please don't crucify me, this is just my own experience!"
393,2,"Make sure your lens is under 5.5"" otherwise there might be a good chance that it won't fit.Other than that it is an excellent bag."
394,1,"I bought this hub because of the Linksys name and didn't need a power input. Agree it is kind of chunky, looks pregnant enough to give birth to a USB cable jack!! Please note that if you need USB 2.0 this hub is not compatible. When I plugged in my Fujitsu Scanner I kept getting alerts saying I wasn't getting optimal speed to/from the scanner so I just plugged in my Mouse and Keyboard into the Linksys, and plugged the Fujitsu into a USB port on the PC and all was fine."
395,2,"I have had this camera for about six months now.  As a serious ammateur photographer for 15 years, I swore that I would still use my film camera for some things, but I haven't touched it.  I take this Sony everywhere.  This camera is a great all-around digital camera.  It is compact, easy to use, the menus and controls are easily understood, and it takes great pictures.  I was thinking about getting the S30 without the video feature instead, but I am very glad I got the video.  I really like the video feature and I use it a lot.  Below are a few major points you should consider about this camera.First of all, no other digital camera brand I have seen comes anywhere close to the lens quality of the Sonys.  The marco (close-up) setting allows you to take a picture from literally a half inch away from the subject.  Most other digital cameras with macro settings let you get as close as a couple feet.  This means that when you can get, at closest, a full-frame picture of your whole hand with other digicams, the sony lets you zoom all the way in to just a fingernail.  Incidentally this camera also has a text-capture mode which I have used quite successfully for taking pictures of blueprints and other documents.  These kinds of images show up nicely on the computer screen.Secondly, This camera is fully mac-compatible.  It comes with a USB cable and software that actually does work on the Mac.  When you connect the camera to the cable, it shows up on the desktop just like a drive.  The only problem I have had is when reading files right off the disc - sometimes it thinks there's a problem with the drive.  If you first transfer them to your hard drive and then view them there's no problem.Some rules of thumb for file size:  A high resolution pic (1600x1200) typically takes about 900k, so I figure about one meg each.  The medium res (1024x768) is about 300k per pic, so I figure about three pics per meg.  These are still pretty high resolution pictures.  The lowest res (640x480) pics take about 100k each (a nice size for emailing).  That's about 10 per meg.  On video mode, the high res (320x240) takes about 100k per second, so about 10 sec of video per meg.  The low res video mode (160x112) does about 40 sec per meg.  So with the 4 mb memory stick that comes with the camera you can get about 4 or 5 high res pics, 15 med res pics, 40 low res pics, 40 sec high res video, or 160 sec low res video.  So in summary, get more memory.  I bought two 64 mb cards and they lasted a whole 4-day vacation, and I am pretty snap-happy.The one problem that I have to complain about is that there is about a one-second delay between pushing the shutter button and the actual capture of the image.  (And I am not talking about the  wait time for writing the file, I am talking about the actual moment of the photograph)  This means that if you are taking pictures of subjects in motion you will have to anticipate the moment and push the button a second early.  If you take a lot of action shots, this camera will proove frustrating.  Often a critical moment will have passed by the time the camera actually takes the picture.  Baby pics, wedding dance pictures, sports shots, all of these are very hard to do with this camera.  For regular static subjects this is not a problem, but for objects in motion this camera is difficult.All in all I highly reccommend this camera.  Happy shopping."
396,2,"The rubber band is apparently a handle.  I inadvertently tossed it out when I opened it to look at it.  Then the next day I saw the hole on the side and thought  &#34;Oh, that is a bracelet handle. Duh&#34;"
397,2,These are what you'd expect from velcro cable ties but I prefer these to the velcro brand version.  They have tags that allow the tie to be easily removed and do not attach throughout the cable but only on a small section near the end of the cable.  This allows you to more easily wrap a cable and hold it tighter then the velcro brand straps.  Definitely recommend!
398,0,"The sound quality is bad. It's too soft and somethimes full of static. However, it is, in a broad sense, what I was looking for."
399,0,"Why why why do I keep turning to Memorex? I don't have too many choices and for the most part these are ok CDS. Yet, out of every stack I have bought at least 10 of these CD's will not burn, multiple computers do not recognize them as blank discs. This has happened time and time again and unfortunately this paired with the ease in which a CD will become scratched and unplayable forces me to stop buying Memorex. 2/5"
400,0,"I returned this lens and got the Sigma 50mm.  There's a reason the Sigma is more expensive, it takes better photos.  Don't waste your precious photographic moments with this Canon lens. You can have better bokeh, more clarity and less distortion with the Sigma.  Also, if you have other 77mm filter sized lenses, the you can share your polarizer, ND and UV filters with the Sigma 50mm f1.8 instead of buying a whole new set for this little Canon lens.  A good polarizer, UV and a couple NDs will end up costing you the price difference."
401,2,"I use it to convert old tapes to CD (via computer), as well as playing CDs and cassettes on it. Having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient, too. The mechanicals and sound performance are excellent. Headphones port with its own vol. contol a nice feature. Thanks, Teac."
402,2,"This is a great case for theCanon PowerShot A470 7MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Gray). Good padding and protection. Camera fits snug and the small pocket will hold four rechargeable AA batteries. The camera only needs two at a time, so you have good backup power."
403,0,"Keys started failing after about 2 months, and some of the key markings rubbed off too.  Not recommended."
404,2,"I bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews I'd read on the internet. I wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldn't break the bank; I will be traveling abroad for a semester, and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not much of an audiophile, but I was very pleased with the PortaPros. They are very comfortable, provide ample bass and overall sound quality, and fold up to make them quite portable to boot (go figure). The included case and 1/4"" audio adapter were nice bonuses. I am using them with an iPod and my laptop, both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros. Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in ""travel mode"" doesn't hold all that well.If you buy them, consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with (Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions). The headphones will last, but the pads might eventually tear (they did on my old Sony headphones)."
405,2,"I put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyard....and boy does it produce nice sound.  I placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier.  I live in rainy Houston, we have had 4 or 5 heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine.  This pair was a great price, arrived very quickly, and sounds just fine.  Buy it and save money."
406,2,"I noticed several negitive reviews for this case that focused on a problem with the case apparently being too deep for the Vista, resulting in it covering over several of the operating control buttons on the GPS itself making the device difficult to use while cased.  I have to say that either this reported problem has been corrected, or the reviewers commented on the wrong case.  The vista HCx eTrax that I bought fits just right in this case.I very much like the 'D' Ring on the back of the case.  This allows the GPS to be lashed to an equipment loop on your backpack or some other convenient place.  I would give this case a 5-star rating but for the fact that I do not much trust the belt hook provided on the case.  Though it has not happen to me, I fear that the GPS could slide unnoticed off a belt and be lost if a backup means of attachment were not used.The overall construction of the case appears to be sound.  The case should provide adequate protection for the eTrax unless it is severly abused and beaten up beyond what one might expect from normal use, which does not include throwing it and having the dog retrieve it, or dunking it in a river to see how many times you can do that before it fails.  You get the idea.Anyway -- great product.  Worth the money."
407,1,"I wanted to buy a good headphone for my iRiver Slim-X 350. Before buying Sennheiser HD-497, I read lot of reviews and finally decided to get this one because it seemed to have what I wanted: great sound, comfort wearing, light weight and long cord. When it arrived, I was surprised to see that it came in such an [enexpensive] plastic package compared to the price I paid and the quality seal was off the place where it should be. But I was still excited to try it on. The first impression I got is it was big and felt very tight on my head. Then I was somewhat disappointed about the sound it delivers. It is not as good as I expected. It does deliver clearer layers of sound from different instruments, but not that great. I tried lot of regular CDs and mp3. The conclusion: the earbuds that came with my iRiver SlimX is not that bad at all in spite of lot of people saying so.Another big problem I got is it is really TIGHT. My head feels pressed and very uncomfortable. So After just two days with Sennheiser HD-497, I'm returning it. The ... return shipping fee is the price I paid to try this product. I will look for something [less expensive] but more comfortable."
408,0,The thing was useless to me because my device needed a power plug about 1 mm larger. Advert was misleading that it would fit the listed CD players.
409,1,"Compare with the Mediabridge one, which is 5$ expensive than this one, I can only give a three star. The Mediabridge  is much heavier than this one and you can feel the difference of quality. For the metal heart inside, Mediabridge is much harder than this. Highly recommend to buy the Mediabridge one. But if you want to buy the soft-line type, this one may be your choice."
410,2,I got this bag for my wife for Christmas 2012 when I got her a T3i.  This bag is well made and holds all kinds of stuff that I got her for the camera.  My only complaint would be that the camera with a lens attached has a hard time storing an additional lens.  It can be done but not with ease.
411,0,"I have tendinitis which prevents me from using a mouse on the right side, even though I'm right handed. I must use a trackball on the left side.This is yet another wireless trackball from Logitech that only works for the right hand.Logitech has no excuse for leaving out left-handed people. It is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sides.Apparently the Logitech marketing department must think that left-handed people must love wires, since all their wireless trackballs are for right-handed people only. I wouldn't be posting this negative review if they had a wireless trackball product that worked for me - but they just don't have any."
412,1,"I don't think there could have been a true 100 feet of wire on this spool.  My room is 26X9 feet, and allowing an extra 6 feet of wire from speaker to floor and 9 more feet at the front to allow me extra wire in case I have to pull my receiver out to hook up something, I figured that was 50 feet, but when I cut off that length of wire to run to one rear surround speaker, I was about 7 or 8 feet short of enough for the second speaker and had to order a second reel of wire to finish the job.  Still waiting for it to show up."
413,2,"Bought 2 pair for an outdoor screened porch for $30 per pair.  They sound great, were easy to mount, and oh so inexpensive!  We've had some gatherings and the sound has been plenty and when sitting out quiet, it sounds great too.For the porch setup, I also purchased a stereo receiver (Sherwood) for $85.  My main goal was to allow radio play and to use an iPod as source for the screened porch.  Well, the sound is great (nice lows and can even blast all the neighbors), the components were cheap (except the iPod) and I can feel okay leaving the receiver outdoors (out of direct rain path, but definitely gets plenty of dust and humidity.)"
414,2,"I'm on my second pair of these headphones. I'm no audiophile - just a gym rat who uses them every day to drive my workouts.Considering the class of headphones under $50 that I have used, for this one:The Good features:  great sound, light on head, excellent bang for the buck.The Bad features:  I carry them in my gym bag along with my other stuff. The cord gets tangled up half the time.  Also, after some time (1-2 years) the ear cushions become shredded, and must be replaced.June 22, 2012 update.  I have purchased another pair, and I'm very impressed. (New headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal.)  The cord seems shorter, and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled. Also the ear muffins appear larger.  For the price, I know of nothing that's better.  A great buy."
415,0,"It works fine, eaven with a compact flash adapter and a pcmica notebook, so you only need one wireless card for both pocketpc and laptop, but one weak after I boughtit it dies, it dosent work any more! Im angry because I live in mexico and I cant use the waranty. bad choice"

It cost me time and aggravation.  For what an item that is well under 10 bucks.  well if you want gray cables that don't work with apple keyboards buy these "" white "" ones. This  company should be avoided there is no way the over label of white 2.1 usb can be an accident.  they are just hoping People don't return them.  Thanks for nothing but more work for a lousy few bucks."
417,1,"...I like it, bulky as it is. This isn't a shirt pocket player, but it's tolerable on your belt or in a coat pocket. The sound quality is very good, and the headphones are _excellent_. The menu system and controls take some practice, but are adequate once you get accustomed to them..."
418,1,I loved my first m130 which lasted about a year. When the case I cracked I bought two more for my husband and me. Both of ours cracked after about a year plus the OS is not compatible with XP for syncronizing. Plus I had a lot of problems with getting a recharger that would work or last long for the M130. I have since bought the Zire 22 which I have had for more than 2 years and the case is still intact.
419,0,"To preface this review, I am probably not the typical USB hub user. If you are a computer-based musician i would urge you to run as fast and as far as you can from this hub. This hub will not allow my Logic Pro dongle (XSkey) and Novation ReMote SL to function simultaneously. My Mac will not recognize the dongle and the SL is spotty. This combo worked (and still works) flawlessly on a Belkin hub. I really needed a 7 port hub but this was not the solution. D-Link's customer service was terrible, blaming my hardware for being out of spec instead of admitting that their hardware was to blame. If anyone can recommend a decent 7-port hub for music I'm all ears..."
420,0,"I bought the DI-624 and a DWL-G520.  Bad, bad, bad, very bad.The problem is the g520.  I cannot get any decent signal strength.  I even added a 6db microstrip antenna and it made no difference at all.  More money wasted.  All I can get under any circumstance is very low signal strength.  It works somewhat until it drops the signal entirely.  How useless it that!!??This card is junk!!  But at least it doesn't freeze my computer."
421,2,"These headphones are the best idea I've seen in QUALITY sound for several years!First the foam is similar to those &#34;in-ear&#34; safety earplugs- you simply roll the foam between two finger and insert the headphones into the ear. The foam them re-expands blocking out sounds and noise letting you hear your music, books, etc. much cleaner. The foam on these In-Ear-Headphones is easily replaceable and come with a replacement set.KOSS has been known for years for their quality sounds equipment and these headphone/ear-bud's are no exception. The sound quality of these was 100% BETTER than my BOSE ear-bud headphones and the noise blocking was unsurpassed with these KOSS &#34;The Plug&#34; headphones. They have even replaced my $249.00 headphones with their quality and great sound experience.A word of caution however, they do block sounds around you, so make sure not to wear them if you need to hear anything else around you. Then again you might want too especially when those around you are boring and annoying!"
422,2,"Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !"
423,2,"The Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite is a great flash unit for use at fairly close range. As the model number indicates, it has a guide number of 14, which means that its effective range is about 14 meters (or 46 feet). This is only slightly more powerful than the built-in flashes in Canon's low-end DSLRs (which have a guide number of 13), and considerably weaker than Canon's other external flash units (the effective range of which varies from model to model, from 22 meters to 58 meters). But the low guide number is not really a problem for the intended use of the MR-14EX, which is close-up and macro photography. By mounting the Macro Ring Lite on a lens, the subject of a photograph is made to seem to be illuminated equally from all directions. This avoids the harsh shadows that are commonly seen in pictures when a single flash unit was pointed directly at the subject.The MR-14EX allows each of its two semi-circular lamps to be adjusted individually, allowing one side of the subject to be illuminated more strongly than the other if desired. It also provides two smaller lamps to aid auto-focusing in dim conditions. It can even serve as a master controller for off-camera Canon Speedlite flash units. It is powered by four AA batteries; rechargeable NiMH batteries are recommended.The MR-14EX mounts easily on theCanon EF 50mm f/2.5 Compact Macro Lens, theCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens(now discontinued), and theCanon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Lens. To mount it on the newCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens, aCanon Macrolite Adapter 67is required. To mount it on theCanon EF 180mm f/3.5L Macro USM Lens, a Canon Macrolite Adapter 72C f/ML-3 is needed. On some other lenses, it can be mounted with reasonable stability simply by attaching an appropriate 58mm step-up ring to the lens. I have done this with aTokina AT-X 100mm f/2.8 PRO D Macro Lensusing aKenko 55mm Step-Up Ring to 58mm. Other lenses will probably require different rings to step up from their native filter size to 58mm.Canon also offers the somewhat more expensiveCanon MT-24EX Macro Twin Lite Flash, which also mounts two lamps on the lens, but instead of a ring the MT-24EX provides two small lamps that can be positioned independently. I have not used it, but it seems to be well regarded."
424,0,"Though it is listed for use in ME, I am not able to get a connection, even 16"" away from the signal.I wanted to add wifi to the laptop I carry on trips instead of the small screen on the phone. Even downloading from Cisco didn't help. It always hangs at aquire. Could be the laptop, could be there isn't any service for older OS's hard to say. Don't need the card with newer laptops, because they already have wireless connectivity installed.The seller I got it from packed it very well & it got here from across the country fastest of all the products i ordered that day."
425,1,"I use this for listening to audio books off my MP3 player, and it's a good solution for this application.  My only complaint is that the tape unit clicks while it is turning, which can get a bit annoying at low volumes.  But for less than $15, I don't know that you can expect crystal clear audio.  Overall, it solves my problem listening problem.Oh, and I ran into the low volume problem when using it in a friend's car -- I only had to change the direction of the tape deck and suddenly I had LOUD volume."
426,0,"What I ran it on: My computer was a 600MHz AMD, 768MB RAM, 128MB ATI Radeon, running Win98SE, with an AT&amp;T Broadband Internet connection.The Install: The installation appeared to go without a hitch. If you don't follow the very specific instructions that the software provides then you will probably run into problems.The Picture: The picture on the Quickcam Messenger was surprisingly good. The friend I was having a Video chat with through Yahoo Messenger had a webcam from a different vendor that cost about half as much and her picture quality was consistently poor.The Framerate: While recording a video to my hard drive the framerate was more than adequate. Over the internet was another story, but I question whether any other webcam could have done better.Reliability: This is where everything goes bad. In the 60 minutes I spent video-chatting with my friend I had to reboot my computer more than 6 times. Even when I wasn't broadcasting images over the Internet, and simply stared at myself on my desktop, the camera (or software) consistently locked up. The software provided is loaded with bugs and merrily installs itself everywhere on your computer (quick-start toolbar, desktop, program menu). I finally gave up on the camera after 2 days of trying to get it to work reliably (updating drivers and such) and returned it. My guess is the camera works great, but the software was thrown together as an after thought. After un-installing the software my computer has never been the same. I can no longer play Windows Media files and I can no longer run graphic intensive applications. I ended up having to re-format my hard-drive, I used this as an opportunity to install Windows XP... 98 is outdated now anyways.Annoyances: If you bought a monitor, and the monitor manufacturer said &quot;You need to subscribe to a 3rd party service in order to view the Internet through your new monitor.&quot; I bet you'd be pretty annoyed. Well that is essentially what Logitech did when they teamed up with SpotLife. You can use the webcam to broadcast video over messenger services such as MSN Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo, etc... But, if you want to broadcast live video from your computer to a web host (as a browser accessible nanny-cam or something) then you'll need to do so through SpotLife. SpotLife gives you a free trial period of course, but the freedom of doing what you want with the streaming images generated on YOUR computer has been taken away from you.Summary: I waited a week after returning my Quickcam Messenger before I wrote this review. I knew that I should let my emotions cool down a little so I could try to write something informative and objective. The webcam may have performed reliably on a system with a different OS and some people might like the idea of SpotLife (it's actually a good idea for people that can't write HTML). If you can buy it from someplace with a flexible return policy then give it a whirl... just have your OS CD handy... for the install... and for when you need to re-format your hard-drive after the un-install.The Bottom Line: I will be buying another webcam, but I'm going to avoid products by Logitech. That's too bad because I used to really like Logitech."
427,0,I tried this converter on three different computers and it was unable to communicated with my old PCMIA card reader/writer.  The drivers loaded properly and all my computers recognize the adapter when it's plugged in but it will not communicate with the one device I needed it to.
428,2,I bought these for my husband since he has sensitive ears.  He loves them!
429,1,"For getting information and e-mail on the go, you can't do better than this.Too bad.The i705 is a viable optoin for the business user or high-end (i.e. rich) home user. It sports always-on Internet, a battery that lasts a lot longer than most cell phones, and some text-based web access (although still limited by the small screen). The main advantage is that you know instantly when you receive an e-mail, with either a flashing light or a buzz signaling to you. I can imagine for a corporate exec, this would be particularly useful for trading messages with your mistress while sitting through another long, boring, inane meeting about network synergy from a high-priced, high-snooze factor consultant.But there are some big drawbacks that have to be solved before Palm will be able to sell these en masse to the consumer market. Price, for starters. The Palm.net service costs about the same as my cell service or high-speed home internet, equalling the cost of the unit after about 15 months. This is just text, folks. A low-bandwidth solution. Prices must come down.Because Palm needs to sell a bunch of these to convince investors to stay with its stock, expect the prices to come down, and fast. Mark my words, this product will be half what it is today by next January. They could even offer it for free with a two-year Palm.net commitment.Second, for the price they are charging, you would expect at least some color. Nada.Third, unless you are going to use the e-mail and Internet functions A LOT, you should consider the larger form factor of this device. It is significantly bulkier than the Palm Vx/Palm 500/505/515 family, yet unlike the Handspring Treo, it doesn't replace your cell phone.Fourth, this device is essentially trying to keep up with the Blackberrys, but the i705 should have been released two years ago. It already looks and feels dated. All you have to do is head down to your local electronics store to see all of the fancy Palm OS/PHONE devices that are going to be far more useful for most people. Most of them are cheaper than this device (you can get some major deals from the cellular companies), include color, and save you major pocket space.Also, don't be surprised if in about six months you start hearing about Palm's likely next promise to try and keep its long-suffering shareholders from jumping ship: A Handspring Treo-like device with a color screen, better battery, Palm/Phone that is smaller, sexier and sleeker than the i705, for probably the same price.Do you really want to shell out major dough for a device that will be state of the art for zero months? If you do, more power to you. In a year or two, the i705 will join your collection of TI Sinclairs, Commodore 64s, Amigas, brick-phones from the 80s, and $20K plasma TVs (that are now $5K?).And, to tell you the truth, there isn't much that's revolutionary here anyway. Palm already had the Palm VII (which you can find for, oh, about zero bucks used) and the Palm Vx/Phone solution, and Handspring will sell you a Visor Deluxe with phone attachment for a fraction of the I705's price. These are a bit less elegant, but who wants to pay several hundred bucks for elegance?If the answer is you, more power to you. For the rest of us, we will just have to wait a while longer."
430,0,These headphones fit my head fine but the sound is awful. From previous reviews I was expecting something that was of a bit better quality. They were inexpensive and look like they are made well but the sound quality makes them almost un-usable.
431,1,"This part is so bad & almost broke, yet still works. Seems like cheap quality, got another wave matching transformer same price but better quality"
432,2,I've had this flash about a month now. I've been pretty happy with it and it does everything I need to do with an off camera flash. Great price.
433,2,"I installed this into my 93 dakota and it works great! I didnt give it 5 stars simply because im not an expert on radios, but for casual daily use while driving it works WONDERFULLY! It is paired on my truck with a k-40 35in antennae, but i am planning on upgrading."
434,0,"I bought this router to use with my dynamic PPPOE DSL connection.  The setup and interface were easy enough to use, but no matter how I configured it, it would not connect to my DSL connection.  The router would get PDAT messages and disconnect immediately.  I found out that other people have had this same problem with this router.Also, I couldn't get the router to update its firmware.  It would repeatedly give me a message saying that the firmware version is incompatible."
435,0,I attempted to use this for the JVC Everio GZ-HD7 camera.  It didn't work.  I couldn't screw it on because the tripod screw was too small.  So please be forewarned all HD7 users.
436,2,"For $15, by far the best choice for portable applications, particularly when there's a moderate level of ambient noise.  Excellent for Walkman or MP3 player use at the gym; they block enough sound so that I can hear the music, but I can still hear if someone is talking to me (although I have to remove at least one of the plugs in order to hear what they're saying).Be sure to save the spare ear foam pieces - you'll probably need them eventually, since they don't fit as well after they soften up too much."
437,0,I have always had a zoom lens and I found it extremely difficult to use a fixed lens.  Having to move your body back and forth to get the right focal length is harder than it seems.  I missed so many great shots.  I also used it at night for a jack o' lantern blaze event and I felt it still was too dark considering the speed of the lens - I expected a little more.  I quickly switched back to my zoom and no longer use this lens.
438,2,The canon remote switch works as advertised.  It would be nice to have a longer cable.  Works on my 70D.
439,2,"I actually use the Canon 200EG photo backpack and it's about the same as this Lowepro, but for a lot less money. Sure, it's not quite as well made and sturdy as this Lowepro but it's also not nearly as expensive. While I wouldn't really hesitate to buy this Lowepro, especially if it were a bit cheaper, I'm very happy with the Canon backpack as I get nearly the same functionality (minus the built-in all weather sheath) for a lot less.A note about the layout-I like this style photo backpack better than the type where the camera gear is placed in the bottom of the pack and the top part is for other items. This style is more space efficient-it can hold more lenses and photo gear in the main compartment, yet the outside dimensions of the bag are less. Granted, you do have to take the pack off and set it down to access it. But I tried a Tamrac backpack (the kind where the camera stuff goes in the bottom part of the pack) before buying the Canon one and I found it way too big and not any more convenient to use as I had to also remove that one from my back to access it. In the end, the Canon pack (and this Lowepro) holds extra stuff too. In the flap pocket, I can fit a shirt, light lunch and other items like a magazine. In fact, I can even fit a small laptop in the main compartment (in a separate laptop slipcase for protection). I would say a 13""-15"" laptop would fit fine, but not a 17"" or larger one.If you want something that you can work out of without having to take it off and yet carries all of your photo gear, I doubt you will ever find it. I would instead recommend a shoulder bag that you carry only one or two lenses in (for weight reasons) for walking around with, and a back pack for transporting all your stuff. I also use the backpack for long walks/hikes and it works fine not fully loaded too. In other words, just because you can take every single photo item you own, doesn't mean you have to or should."
440,1,"First the PROS of this Product:You will NOT find as many features packed in ANY OTHER PDA today on the market. The fact that it has BOTH type of Memory slots, the built-in Wifi and the removable battery - yet 1/2 the thinness as the Compaq, would make this unit the BEST unit on the market. HOWEVER....The CONS:- Battery life is extremely short. 1 Hour if you are using the Wifi - 3 Hours at the most for everything else- The display really sucks, especially when you compare it to the Casio E125. Forget about using it in the Sunlight.- TOO many lockups. 2 to 3 times a day I have to reset. Toshiba is well aware of this problem. No service pack available today and no date for the release.- The buttons are too easy to touch and turn on the unit by you just ""blowing"" on it - so you take out your unit ... and the battery is DEAD- The Record button is in the WRONG PLACE. It is EASILY turned on every time you take out the unit from the sleeve.- USB Problems with Synching.Overall - this is a BETA unit with WAY too many problems.My recommendation is to WAIT till Toshiba has posted the Service Pack - then re-evaluate. I personally am NOT happy with it..."
441,0,"It is fine when I use wireless w/o wep encryption. (although when I transfer files between two computers using this router, wireless lan is disconnected after few MB of transfer)I can surf web for long, and play counter strike w/o much of lag.But when I enable 64bits wep (128bits also available), it drop my connection after few minutes.So it keep ask me if I want to connect to available wireless network every 2~3minutes.And Of course, if I was downloading some files, then I get disconnected. I had to re-download that again.I can use it w/o wep enabled, but I don't want other people stealing my bandwidth, so I'm going to return this and pay $20 more to get linksys"
442,2,"This is one of those ""must-have"" headphones that you can use as a reference to compare other headphones with.  It's the best in its class and beats many other headphones that are way more expensive.This headphone require some breaking-in period (at least 40 hours), otherwise you may find the bass to be overpowering and fatiguing, as I did at first.  I put the headphone in continuous play through an amplifier for over 40 hrs non-stop at med-high volume.  Now they sound better-- less fatiguing and more ""laid back,"" as the audio geeks would say.If you want more portability, try the cheaper Koss KSC-50.  They are clip-ons but sound almost the same as the PortaPros.  I said almost, because the PortaPros are punchier and have more defined bass."
443,2,"You seriously can't beat the price on this. It's a bit bulky, but I'm not sure if the Canon model is the same in the way of bulkiness. It works great and the price is awesome."
444,2,"This is a simple electronic cable release I bought to use with the Canon 7D, and it works perfectly with it. Gave it 4 starts instead of 5 because it is very easy for the slider lock to become engaged. I disabled it by simply taping it so the slider switch cannot move."
445,1,"Both my cars came with tape players (which I don't use), so this unit was perfect for me to route the audio from external units to a vehicle's stereo system.I use this for my Garmin Nuvi 360 and Zune without having to run any wires behind the dash. It doesn't provide any control of the external accessories (i.e. I still have to use the Nuvi's touch screen, or the Zune's touchpad). Now all my songs and playlists are in one MP3 player that goes with me.The only caveat is that the stereo will be in tape mode all the time. So, when hooked up to a GPS, one can't listen to the radio/CDs and have the music interrupted when the GPS issues turn instructions.It worked out good enough to get another for the other car."
446,1,"I ignored tales of caution regarding this because of the remarks I'd heard regarding the sound on these cans, and they are pretty good. I didn't spend time measuring how warm it is or anything because I found these incredible uncomfortable. The phones them selves can with not much effort be popped off of the main headband, which itself is very tight on the head.They do have great sound from what I gathered in my months having them, but these headphones feel cheaply made and aesthetically are not too pleasing. You're not going to want to wear these in public."
447,2,"Porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there's a reason they've been so successful. It's because they sound so good!  I've had several versions of these since the late 70s, and never been disappointed. Get some, you'll be glad you did."
448,1,"Very easy to use but overpriced, however there is not much else out there with similar design. Radio Shack carries similar banana plugs, but they cost only a couple of dollars less.Obviously, sound quality wise these are not any better than $1 banana plugs where you have to tighten the screws, the question to ask is whether the convenience is worth $$ to you.Three stars only because they are overpriced, if they were $10, I would have given them 5 stars."
449,1,"Does the job, but flimsily built. Connecting wires are too short to fit most of the antennas. Connectors detach from the wires too easily."
450,2,"This is a good backpack for someone with a small amount of equipment.  I use it with my Nikon D40, which usually has the 18-200 zoom attached.  It's easy to get that combination in and out without completely unzipping the bag.  I also carry my SB-800 flash, and there is room for a couple fixed or small zoom lenses as well.  The bag will also accept a small book, up to trade paperback size, or notepad lying flat on top of the equipment.The outside pocket is good for temporary storage of filters while you're shooting.  It's not my style, but if you like to have your phone clipped to the backpack straps it's set up for that.  When I was shooting at the AirVenture show I used those clips to carry my aviation radio.One thing that can be a little frustrating is that the tolerances around the zippers are pretty tight, meaning that it can occasionally be a little tough to get the zippers to move.  The upside of that is that the zippers are pretty well protected from light rain if you're wearing this as a backpack.Like most backpacks, you'll need to grab some of the straps to avoid having them drag on the ground if you're using the top carry handle.The tripod holder is useful.  You can't put a monster tripod on there, but any basic 3 leg tripod would work just fine.  The straps that hold tripods in place are not fastened to the backpack (they loop through straps on the bag), so there is some potential for losing them if they aren't closed after use.  The plus of that is that they are replaceable and if you needed something different it would be easy to install.  It's not clear whether the tripod straps are enough to hold a monopod in place.Overall build quality is excellent.  I expect the one I have to last for several years."
451,2,"I always liked Koss Headphones. The price and the Sound. Some reviews say that it is bass heavy. If you have an EQ mode on your Mp3 Player then try that to adjust the sound to your liking. Ipods and Zunes players have good EQ Settings. Love the ear cushions. They fit really good. Would recommend these headphones especially for the priceNote:To get the Cushions to fit in properly. try this, lightly squeeze the foam then insert in to your ear and hold for about 5 sec. it should form inside the ear and you not have a problem of them slipping out."
452,2,"I bought my EBM-901 a few days back and it is better than I thought.Positives:1) Light and compact. Easy to carry.2) Very Easy to set up once you read the manual.3) Great UI, easy to use.4) Backlit display is a great feature.5) MP3 player and ebook reader, TO-DO list, address book and calendar.Negatives:1) Less memory for your content(just 3MB after you install the OS and other meaningful software)2) Backlight makes a weird sound when used(very low but can be heard at night when it is quiet).3) Consumes batteries like a monstor.I knew all these problems(except 2) before I bought the device. I was alo prepared to invest to upgrade to 64 MB and buy rechargable batteries. So now I have a great book reading device and MP3 player that I use everywhere."
453,2,"I needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds I had.  I'm very happy with these on both accounts, and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options."
454,2,"We were moving and didn't want to leave the Bose 161 speakers (that I had installed in every room of our home.)  I looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place, and took a chance on these Audio Source LS 200 speakers based upon the reviews here in Amazon.com. Although the reviews were good, one doesn't expect ""real"" quality at this price. You cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced! They are not as spacial as the Bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent.  Like the Bose they fall off rapidly below about 80Hz but are very linear up to the audible limits. (If you want more bass add a sub-woofer.)"
455,2,"I've had my PortaPros for several years now, and they've served me very, very well.Pros:- Best sound I've heard in a small portable headphone. (My Grado SR-80s sound better, but there's no way you'd walk down the street in 'em)- Fold reasonably well into a coat-pocketable clump- Durable as heck (other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers).  I use the heck out of these, and they take it in stride.Cons:- Look pretty un-cool.- Foam earpiece covers need replacing every 50 or so uses - cheap and readily-available from Koss, takes a minute to do."
456,1,I bought these for  my kid and they didn't last very long.They are cheaply made and not worth the money.
457,2,"Overall, its a pretty cool little product. I bought the corded Remote Shutter Release because, I find the wireless one don't work as well. Great Purchase."
458,1,"This is what Monster says: ""AC Power by nature is ever-changing, appliances turning on and off in your home causes voltages to surge and spike, and this is sometimes noticeable in the form of lights suddenly dimming. This causes a state of flux for the power running your delicate electronic devices, lowering the performance of the audio/video as well as causing damage to the components. Other conditions such as power outages and lightning strikes only increase this fluctuation. Proper connection to an advanced surge protector that offers integrated system protection can help minimize the risk of permanent surge damage...""Now, come on guys, a surge or spike is NOT going to cause your lights to dim, if anything they will brighten. A sag will cause dimming. If this thing could prevent you from feeling the effects of a power sag, it would be very good, but it would also be an UPS or a big mother SOLA transformer...and it's not. This is just a surge supressor, like many others, and certainly well worth having, but it will help not at all with very annoying sags, as Monster implies."
459,0,"rugged, totally manual.the ""B"" side has stopped working.Wasn't used that much. took a whileto troubleshoot, since I did notsuspect the switch would fail."
460,0,"After using this lens with other lens, I conclude thatthis is the worst lens I have ever used so far.And it is useless for crop sensor cameras. And I am wonderingwhy this lens came with Canon 7D as a bundle.Whenever I bring this lens out, I always regret.28mm is not wide enough.  And the general purpose quality of28-135 mm is below the general quality.If I compare this lens with Sigma 17-70mm, Sigma is so muchbetter. Sigma has so much quality and the sharpness is reallyamazing. I normally don't realize it until I switch the lens withthis low quality Canon 28-135mm. Comparing with Tamron's18-250mm, within the same range, I think that Tamron isstill better. And I am wondering why you should use this lenswhen you use cropped sensor camera.And I you use an expensive full frame camera, there is noreason why you make your full frame camera a cheap point andshoot by using this lens."
461,2,"I got hooked on the Brother P-Touch label maker at work, and even though I could borrow it occasionally for home use (and not have to pay for the label tape, which is expensive), I got sick of not having it at hand to print a label on the spur of the moment (which is how you want to be able to print labels). I bought what seems to be a top-of-the-line unit which prints on several tape widths (our last machine only printed on 1/2"" tape), and I really like having recourse to this wider labeling tape, which allows more room for clearly printing information such as name tags with address, etc."
462,2,What can you say about a tape. They are going the way of the dodo bird but I still use them until I can no longer find them.They work for me.
463,2,"I decided to get this after buying the Rebel XTi and already owning the Rebel XT (this works with both.)  I already had the corded shutter release which was nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even a little camera shake can make a huge difference.  But this goes to a new level, you can set the camera up get everything in focus and then step back and take as many shots as you want without any risk of touching the camera.  Make sure to cover the eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure.  This is also handy when you want to take pictures with you in them.  I have even used it with two cameras at once to get multiple angles of the same shot.  I am thinking about setting up a blind and setting up the camera on a tripod to try to get some close up pictures of wildlife that would not be possible otherwise.  Basically if you ever have a need to take pictures without holding the camera this is your solution."
464,0,"Just returned from an airline trip where I tried out my new Sennheiser phones for the first time.  Based on reviews here and elsewhere I was not expecting complete noise cancellation, but I would estimate these phones only reduced the jet engine noise by less than fifty percent.  Pressing the phones closer to my ears improved the performance somewhat, but I have to wonder if it is worth the effort to haul these phones onto the plane if they only reduce the noise by half or less.  On the other hand, I have used the phones with a new Phillips portable DVD player and find them to work well with this device, though you do need to have the noise cancellation turned on to get better, full sound. The phones are very comfortable to wear and fold up easily for compact storage in the provided case."
465,2,I always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that iPods provide. I've got smaller-than-normal ears and the buds are really painful after a while. These Koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in. Then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear. Fantastic. They also have great sound. Definitely worth ordering.
466,2,"The Palm m100 PDA has revolutionized the way I keep track of my appointments.  I can't imagine life without it! Using a stylus, you can easily enter appointments, phone numbers, to-do lists, etc. by writing in the small screen.  The handwriting recognition is less than perfect, but it has come a long way since PDA's were first introduced.  Most letters of the alphabet are straightforward to write, but a few (such as K, Q, and T) require specialized, although easily remembered, strokes. Numbers are intuitive, but punctuation requires a little more study.You won't find tons of features on this model, but I find that I rarely use everything it DOES offer.  Its simple gray and black screen is easy to read in both bright and dim conditions.  Have an appointment next year?  A standing one every Tuesday?  No problem.  Navigating the calendar, from daily to monthly to yearly displays, is a breeze.  I frequently use the alarm feature to remind me of obligations I'm likely to forget - it can be set to go off a minute or several hours beforehand. With a push of a button, you can go to your address book, to-do list, appointment calendar, and a Palm stroke tutorial.  Icons on the screen itself take you to the overall menu, calculator, and search features.You can synch the information entered on the Palm to your PC, so you'll have two updated copies of all your information.  (The Mac requires a little more finagling than does a PC, but is compatible.)I highly recommend this for people who have not yet tried a PDA.  You won't be overwhelmed with bells and whistles, and yet you'll have more than enough features to suit your needs.  Its reasonable price also makes it attractive for students and people hesitant to carry expensive items around with them."
467,1,"These earphones sound great but are so bulky that I never use them. Based the product photo, I knew when I ordered them that they would be bulky, but I expected to be okay with that. I wanted to use these with my iPods for exercise/walking. The cord is very long and you can roll it up on the attached spindle, but then you have the spindle to deal with. Great sound quality and very comfortable, but annoying to use compared to my Bose earbuds. These would be perfect for someone who listens to an iPod while seated, or for your kids to use in your car. They would be perfect if they were wireless."
468,0,"Save your money, I should have taken the advice of the other negative postings. I had this on my home network for three months and it only worked for the first 2 weeks. I even did all of the updates and patchs and it could not handle my VPN to work and the wireless would surf at below dial up speeds. I had to buy the Linksys to replace it and it has been working great."
469,2,"Looking for portable headphones, I first went with theSennheiser  PX 100 Lightweight Collapsible Headphones, because I've been using Sennheisers for years (the HD 580s for about 12 years before they finally died, and theSennheiser  CX300-B In-Ear  Stereo Headphone (Old Version)for the couple of years they lasted), and figured I'd try their portable headphones.  As I wrote in my review of the PX-100s (http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6FUMDQJ2RW/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), I found them uncomfortable, and lacking in bass.  These PortaPros fix both those problems: I can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore, but this is a big improvement over the Sennheiser PX 100s, which started hurting after only about an hour.  Bass is good enough, though perhaps lacking slightly compared to high-end headphones.  But, for $40 these offer a great bang-for-buck in sound quality.The only negatives are the retro look (if that bothers you - I don't mind it at all), and if you have long hair (I don't), the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands; I know when this starts happening to me, it's time for a haircut :)"
470,0,"I got this Viking reader after reading all the negative reviews here. I work on the computer industry and usually do not have problems with installing new devices like these. So even after I read the negative reviews, I figured I could make this work with the right drivers.Boy I was wrong. I first installed the drivers which came on the CD. Windows 2000 recognized all the 4 drives and showed them in Windows explorer. Now when I inserted by Compact flash card, it did not recognize the media and kept asking me to insert the disk in the drive.I tried rebooting multiple times, installing and uninstalling the drivers. No luck. I even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review. That didnt work either.After 2 days of meddling I gave up and shipped it back to amazon.Note:  This drive also looks unusually big for a card reader. The photo is not representative of its actual size."
471,0,"I purchased the NETGEAR GS108 to replace a Gigafast 10/100 switch; to speed up backups from our home gigabit enabled PCs to our NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices. Well, it was a disappointment from second 1.My DSL router just rebooted continually, and I suffered from local broadcast storms. I am using a Proline DSL router, from my local carrier. Wireshark showed the broadcast traffic was being switched erratically, thus its continuance.I called Netgear Tech Support, very bad. They asked just a few basic questions, and then said my unit was faulty and that it should be returned. Lucky for me that Amazon has a great return policy, I really appreciated that. 2 stars because of that.My son advised me to purchase an HP ProCurve Switch 1400-8G. Bless his nerdy heart. Well, I did, and it has worked flawlessly. Available via Amazon for a similar price. Lifetime warranty too, amazing for a device like this. It is working flawlessly.Of course, your mileage may vary. Many people seem to like the NetGear product, and that's why I purchased it initially.I should also add that the gigabit switch update has shortened my backups to 10 minutes from 30. Not bad."
472,1,"I bought this lens strictly for shooting stars. Good (not great) value for the money. There aren't many wide lenses out there this fast. It works well for stars. I'm able to get 2 more stops of shutter speed compared to my f/2.8 lenses. A big plus in my opinion. On the down side, this lens vignettes badly at anything wider than f/3.5. Not a huge issue when the scene is mostly dark and I typically add vignetting to some degree in post processing. The AF system is very clunky. Flip a switch AND the focus barrel?? Again, not a huge deal for me as I keep this lens on manual focus for shooting stars."
473,2,"I had never seen the need for such a device until I was given one. Now, I can't get along without it. I love my m100. It synchs with my Outlook software so I can carry about my contacts as well as my To Do notes and much more. It has games to keep me occupied  on the bus and trains and planes. It has the ability to beam cards, notes, and even applications between units. Amazing little helper! I definitely recommend it..."
474,0,"(Disclaimer:  I'm already bitter about Netgear, because I owned a WGT624 wireless router, and the thing would literally die and need to be reset every two weeks.  But, I was told, Netgear's ProSafe products are better, they're more professional-grade, and they just work.  Well, ha.)I bought this GS105E ""unmanaged plus"" switch a month ago.  Let me tell you, as an unmanaged switch, it works.  I connected it to my router, and then plugged in my Roku, Xbox, and Blu-Ray player, and viola, they're connected to my network.  So, it does its basic job okay, at least.But I wanted more than that.  This thing promises network monitoring, VLANs, and bandwidth control.  Supposedly, it can give you that... IF you're running an older version of Windows!  Instead of a web-based interface like most modern devices, this thing requires you to use Windows-based software that only works on older versions of Windows.  All I have in my home now is Win7 64-bit and Mac OSX, and ""administration software"" isn't available for either of them.  (The Netgear website called ""NETGEAR Product compatibility for Microsoft Windows 7"" doesn't mention this router at all, if that tells you anything.)While trying to learn how to operate this thing, I learned about other unpleasant quirks it has.  Apparently it uses UDP for administration login, and broadcasts your login unencrypted across your entire network.  (If you don't know why this is bad, then you don't need a router with ""extra"" features anyway, go buy the cheapest unmanaged router you can find instead.)That brings me to my conclusion:  While this switch works on a basic level, it's perfect for nobody.  If you don't need extra features and just want an unmanaged switch, get a cheaper-but-better one from someone like Asus or Buffalo.  If you DO want a switch with extra management and monitoring features, you should buy one with a web-based interface so you never get screwed on (lack of) OS support.  Netgear makes one, the GS108T, but it costs more and I'm not sure I'll trust Netgear again for a long time anyway."
475,0,"If I were only reviewing the sound quality of these headphones I'd give them 5 stars. If I were only reviewing the comfort of these headphone I'd give them 5 stars. After all, I've bought three sets of them I liked the sound and comfort so much. The problem is, that it was three sets in less than 18 months...All of them failed in the same way: the right channel just crapped out from a cheap cord design. The first set I chalked it up to me not treating them right. The second set I was a bit angry about but I decided to try the warranty replacement. Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to buy a 3rd pair while waiting on the very slow warranty service, which wound up replacing them with a completely different model of headphone to add insult to the whole process.Well, yesterday, in spite of my gentlest treatment yet, set #3 crapped out in the right channel after only 4 months. That's it, I'm not wasting any more money on these headphones and I recommend the same to everyone else."
476,0,"Please don't buy this camera. This camera has the WORST auto focus you can imagine. I have used Canon EOS for over a decade. Maybe that is why I believe this camera is sub-standard. For indoor pictures, it takes a few seconds after you press the shutter to take the picture. Try to get a good picture of a young child with a camera like that! Even my 3MP Kodak takes better photos indoors than this one."

478,0,"I recently purchased this headset because I bought the Panasonic phones and the reviews said this was the way to go.  I tried it and didn't like it so I set it aside and waited a few weeks.  Then I tried it again.  I have adjusted the handset volume and tried calling several different people, some with land lines and others with cell phones, but the audio quality just isn't there.  Everything sounds kind of muffled and it makes conversations difficult to understand.  For the record, I do not have a land line and only use the Link to Cell feature on these Panasonic phones.  Maybe this one just doesn't work well with the Panasonic KX-TG7643M, but my 3 year old unknown brand ear bud sure does.  I even tried this headset on my Samsung Convoy cell phone and it didn't sound good there either, but again the 3 year old ear bud seems to work just fine.  The only problem is the cord is starting to show copper near the connection end on my 3 year old ear bud so I fear it will fail soon.  For what I paid for this Panasonic headset I just can't justify trying to send it back.  Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
479,0,"I bought this lense about 3 years ago and used it very little. I've used it at Christmas and various vacation trips. It's by far the worst lense I own. In fact I have several Canon lenses that SUCK!!It seems Canon has a problem with quality control. Make as many new models as possible to keep share holders happy. I would rate this minus 5 if I could. Canon want's $204.00 just to look and see if anything is wrong. Plenty, autofocus sucks, pictures blurry no quality control!!Yes, I feel better now."

481,1,"These cases are just okay. I have a lot of Maxell double CD cases, but I've had trouble finding them, so I bought these. They don't grip the CDs quite strong enough, so the CDs sometimes fall off, and the centerpiece tends to snag the paper label on the back of the case. If you're just storing CDs, these will work fine, but if you want to access your CDs regularly, they aren't that great."

483,2,"I own 9 pairs of headphones and several more have been and gone.By far, the PortaPros are my favourite for portable music. Long walks with the dogs, bike riding, train travel, plane travel.The sound these little babies pump out belies their size. Truly excellent acoustics for such a small package.Not many companies these days offer a lifetime guarantee. Says a lot about this product.Some people are unsure of the retro look. I for one love it. They're unique in that regard, but at the end of the day, it's all about the sound and that's where these headphones excel.Do yourself a favour and get some."
484,1,"I have to agree with many of the reviewers who have given these earphones low marks for comfort -- the sound is great, but it just doesn't make up for the fact that the ear pads are very hard and they really aren't large enough to cover the ear.  Very uncomfortable to use for more than about 30 minutes or so.  I am very disappointed, especially after reading the many GOOD reviews.  These people must have really small, really hard heads."
485,2,"I have a very nice set of stereo headphones which, for reasons I cannot understand, does not include an in-line volume control.  I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control.  The device works perfectly, just as it is supposed to.  The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers.  Overall, I'm totally satisfied with this product."
486,1,dont waste your time. this is not worth it. there are many other chips that will more bang for your bucks.
487,2,Digital portable radios drive me crazy with the huge change in volume that comes with one unit of volume increase/decrease.  I use this to adjust radio volume through headphones in a more useful way.  All is well.

489,2,"Great value in a pre-amp IF you don't need a phono input.  Adding a phono input to this pre-amp will require an after-market stand alone unit, and they are not cheap.  You can build your own, if you're an accomplished DIYer, but either way, be advised that this unit has no phono pre-amp.  Otherwise, it has great sound and just the right amount of input and switches that you're likely to use in the typical home stereo set-up.  You may not like that the volume control uses detentes; I find that annoying, so that's why this is 4 Stars.  I use this with its sister power amp, the Amp 1.  Clean, raw, 3 D, excellent sound stage and separation.  Low (undetectable) noise and distortion.  Transparent.  This preamp has driven Magnepans with an Atlantic Audio sub, and it simply disappears.  No hum, no feed back, no ground loop issues."

491,2,This is the second pair of Koss Porta Pros I have purchased (wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod). Sound quality is great for the price.  They are comfortable to wear.  What more can you expect.

493,2,Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered. . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice. ..Cons :  Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones. ..
494,2,"For a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others.  However, these are extremely comfortable.  The isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones.  And, they don't have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds.  Koss, ""Sparkplug"" earphones are also worth consideration.  The Sparkplug model earphones sound about the same, but have a little higher profile out of ones ear."
495,0,"Unit constantly shuts itself off and loses tracks, even with a brand new battery. Doesn't fit in belt clip case provided by manufacturer. Comes with iTunes software, but isn't compatible with iTunes. And to add insult to injury, you can't return it to the store once you've opened it. You have to jump through hoops to return it directly to the manufacturer.In short, save your money, this thing isn't worth it. Either go all out and get the ipod or go with a great mp3 alternative--a Sony Net MD player."
496,0,"After countless attempts to install this product, I called customer support only to be informed by their technical support that this unit was not compatible with my operating system (Windows Vista). Needless to say I returned the unit."
497,2,"Generally, the product is good and works as advertised. Definitely more positive than negative, however... it is very hard to snap shut the tray once you've put the cables inside. I had to really work to get the tray closed in a tight place. Also, I wish they would be more specific about which other products match this one if you don't want to buy the full kit. I need one more 48"" length of tray, but am not sure which product to buy for the matching component.One more positive point - I used the adhesive backing to stick to distressed wood and brick. It seems to hold well on both of those surfaces, which I was pleasantly surprised by."
498,0,"I figured I would spend the money for this card.  There are a lot of other cards out there for less that does essentially the same thing.  The profile of this card isn't the best.  It sticks out an inch.  I figured this would translate to better reception.  Not so.  Signal quality is very twitchy and I often need to relocate.  For the price I would expect better.  For example, I have used NetGear for less $$ but better reception.  This is not a bad product but not worth the extra $$.  Try something else."
499,1,"I bought this set to use with my 50"" Samsung plasma TV.  They look great, but don't sound as spectacular as some of the other reviewers claim.  I will not claim to be an audiophile, but I do like crisp treble - which these speakers lack and the bass - for lack of better terms pukes out at relatively low volume.  The subwoofer is either underpowered too small or not sufficiently baffled.  It distorts easily on movie sound tracks where there is a slight rumble.  Yes, there is an adjustment for bass gain; however, it does not manage the sound very effectively.  I would like to mount the speakers next to the TV on the wall. The speakers do not have wall mounts and the subwoofer box will have to be placed near them - it's not huge, but too big to be mounted behind my TV and funny looking on the audio rack so, placement will be a challenge.  Overall, I'm somewhat disappointed with Klipsch - I always thought they were super high end - I would rank this set above a logitech for appearance - maybe quality, but way below a Bose system - I wish I would have bought instead.  I may just go back to my Polk powered subs and towers - sometimes the sweetness of low price never equals the bitterness of low quality."
500,0,"I purchased this router hoping to share our DSL connection across our three computers, and share a networked printer.While set-up was flawless and the Wireless connection worked out of the box, we were not able to connect to any computers within our home network.  After speaking with customer support they stated that the router does not support computers connecting to each-other, nor shared printers within the local network.Needless to say, this is going back to the store."
501,1,"I have had 2 of these units for years and both work OK. I use them to monitor for people at the side door of my law office. Having had 2 of them for years I offer these tips. First, the outside motion sensor takes a 9 volt battery and you should use only lithium batteries in the outside unit as lithium batteries are not as temperature sensitive as regular batteries, which perform poorly when cold.  Lithium batteries are more expensive up front but they last 5 to 7 times or more longer than a regular battery.  With the inside receiver unit you can use whatever battery type you prefer or an AC/DC adapter. The inside unit needs 3 ""C"" size batteries.  Second, some reviewers have complained that the unit goes off for no reason.  We found that flying insects were setting off the unit by flying near it.  My solution has been to spray flying insect killer around the unit every 2 weeks or so in the summer.  That works for us.  Others might want to adjust or reduce the sensitivity of the motion detector by placing black electrical or other suitable tape over the sensor window.  But rest assured that if an insect flies into or on the sensor, it will set it off.  That is probably true for any motion detector, no matter what the price.  To be sure, there are better quality units on the market, but not at this price.  Once we switched to a lithium 9 volt battery in the sensor unit and wiped out our flying insect problem about a year ago, the units have worked perfectly."

504,1,"As I've worked in PC repair, freelance consulting, and network administration, I've learned having the capability to do things like update anti-virus software for a client (usually if an anti-virus program is going to fail, it's on install, or the first update), it's nice to be able to hook into a high speed connection, even if the person's computer doesn't have a network card, or even a modem.I've also used it to troubleshoot existing connections (this NIC does have LEDs, so it makes troubleshooting pretty easy, although you can still run into 10/100 problems... don't be surprised if your hub is glowing amber instead of green... it means your connection is only running at 10 MBPS versus 100), and bypassing bad network cards.As it is portable, it is my own personal toolkit which only really consists of stuff I use often enough to justify limited space.At USB 1, the maximum speed for this product is 12 MBPS...which means if you're going to use it for an internet connection, it probably will do just fine (most internet connections, you're a VERY lucky person to have even a 1 MBPS connection), but for networking, it will run almost 90% slower than a standard network card).I got a brochure recently for the much awaited 2.0 (which runs at 480 MBPS, although I'm not sure if the 2.0 network card will run that fast. At the very least, I imagine it will be true 10/100), but I'm still not sure when that will be released.As for this product's durability, it is slightly fragile... but I've had mine for over six months now, and I haven't had a day's problem with it... treat it gently, and it'll last a good long time.If your in repair, I'd suggest one of these, and a USB drive of at least 128 Megs (I kept tapping out my 64, although 64 is still great for pulling drivers from your working machine to one that probably doesn't connect to the internet... or pulling a sample of a corrupted file back to the shop for analysis."

I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.My beef is with the cost of support.  3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for several minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!!

I used the Easylink advisor and it showed that it could not find the SSID or the key or anything.  So I had to reboot.  This has happened twice so far.  I did not spend as much time trouble shooting this time because I had seen it before.  It looks like it will stay up for about a week before I have to reboot.

512,0,"Let me first say that the pictured version, the light silver one, is an EXCELLENT product! I've been using it with a Fujitsu T4010 laptop for almost a year, but it works great even on widescreen 15.4"" laptops... It's whisper quiet, vents all the air out the back, and is not dependent on airflow from underneath whatsoever. Some reviewers have commented on poor positioning of the fans...that's actually a non-factor due to the air channels which allow a small amount of air to constantly flow past the bottom of your laptop - and that's really all that's needed to keep heat from building up. I use my laptop to edit video, which used to make it scorching hot..and even with normal use, I had to keep a phone book under it, though even that got warm on the bottom after some time. The old version, though thin and light enough to take anywhere (even coach class on a Regional Jet), made my laptop feel cool to the touch. I've been using As a bonus, it drew a very negligible amount of power, which at most cut down battery life by a few minutes.Now the bad news: One day, the engineering and marketing teams at Targus got together and were really bored. Apparently the ER surgeons of the USA were telling them to stop stealing their business by preventing burn injuries , so they decided to make their ""redesign"" so terrible that no one would want to use it.I discovered this when I ordered the pictured item for some friends off of Amazon (I'm their ""PrimePimp"").They sent me the ""new improved"" one twice. The old one sucked the air down and blew it all out of the back...the new one blows it up which causes the air to spread around which can still make you warm if it's on your lap. Also, it's MUCH louder, drains the battery of my laptop much more, and heavier, thicker, etc...I could use the old one in classes with no one noticing, but the new one is loud to the point that you'd be embarrassed to have it in public. It's definitely not something that's portable due to its heft and awkward size. Another problem is that it draws air from the bottom...so if you have loose clothing, are placing it on a couch, etc, the air intake will get blocked.Lastly, the fins aren't shielded well, and they aren't built well. I had a few blades take flight and one of them made a nice scuff on my laptop.I hope that they either 1) Bring back the old version, or 2) At least change the pic...it's very misleading of Targus to keep the same model number for a product that is in no way alike. That's like ordering a Lexus ES350 and getting a Toyota Carolla and the dealer justifying it by saying ""Well...they both do the same thing and are both made by the same company.""The pictured version is at W@l-M@rt, it's worth a test drive and the extra price. I'm just thankful for Amazon's great customer support and gracious return policy.Shame on you Targus, Shame on you!"

515,0,"The Sony MDR-J10's concept appealed to me for its convenience- we all hate the times when we run and our headphones fall off because, well, there's nothing to keep them in place when we're constantly moving. The little loops that go around your ears really do keep the headphone buds in place, and you can bet your bottom dollar that they won't come off when you're running.After a couple months of usage, though, I found two issues that persisted: (1) while the loops kept the earbuds near the ear, the earbuds would barely be in the ears- sometimes they'd just dangle there, and (2) the earbuds would get really dirty from ear wax, to the point where the ear wax stuck in the ear buds would muffle sound. These issues sound a bit too minor at first, but they really do prevent you from listening to music in the long run. Allow me to explain.(1) After some time, ear buds don't go in the ear.The rubber loops, after having your headphones around for a while, do bend. It's only natural, which doesn't make this Sony's fault (though, I do wonder if they can propose a solution). Because the rubber bends, the ear buds will not go into your ear after a while. They'll *touch* your ear, maybe, but the point is, the sound will not go directly into your ear. This causes you to raise the volume on your mp3 player as a temporary solution; however, when you're running, this solution doesn't really work, as air movement crowds out the sound and all you hear is the wind as you run. If you don't believe me, please try it for yourself. As long as the ear bud is in your ear, sending music into your ear, you will hear the music- but if it's not sending music into your ear, you're not going to hear much.(2) Ear buds get dirty.They do. I tried to fit some of those foam protectors over the earbuds, so I can still hear music but ear wax doesn't get inside them, but the design of the headphones don't allow for such protectors to fit. Actually, you only need to use these headphones a few times before the ear buds get clogged with earwax. That earwax blocks the sound more, leading you to blast the mp3 player really loudly.After a while, you begin looking for alternatives to these headphones. Don't get me wrong- I love the concept behind these headphones, the concept of keeping the buds in place- but these really are inexpensive and they do come with their issues. I'd say they last 1-2 months before it's time to buy another pair. If you don't mind needing to buy new MDR-J10's regularly, then I think you'll like these headphones. Personally, I did not like them too much.Hope this helps. Feel free to comment/ask questions."
516,1,"Noting that this is a low end headset, the unit performs it's function well. Sound volume controls are sufficently well placed for good control and an ample lenght of cord for any setup. Sound quality is rated very good. The headset adjustment could be a little easier to set, but overall, a good buy for the novice"
517,1,"I bought this card as a spare memory for my Casio 5MP digicam.The original memory that I got free as a bonus with the camera wasbranded Edge and also has 128MB on it. The first thing I did whenI got the Viking card was of course insert in into the camera and seeif it works. It sure did, but I immediately noticed that it is quitea bit slower than Edge.  Maximum resolution pictures produce filesabout 2.5MB in size and it took good 4-5 seconds to record them tothis Viking card. Add to that 2-3 seconds that camera takes for imageprocessing and you get whopping 7-8 seconds from shot to shot.For comparison with the Edge card it is 4-5 seconds. Still a lot, but notas frustrating.The only plus - Viking is cheap from many retailers, and rebates are oftenavalable.My advice: if you need SD memory for digital photography at high resolutionget a card with guaranteed high transfer rate - at least 5MB/sec.You'll have to pay more, but it is worth it."
518,2,"I use this on rallys, it's small and discreet easy to remove and install back again.  Doesn't have amazing range but good enough for me.  I use in combination with the little wil antenna.  Waaaaayyyy better than any of those handheld radios and fantastic for checking the route ahead if you can get in touch with a friendly trucker or two."
519,0,I tried using it with Iphone earbuds. Sound diminished so much I could not use it. Quality looked good though.
520,2,No longer use wired headphones as I have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones.  I couldn't deal with the messy wires. They worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to sell.
521,2,"I bought a set of the Koss Porta Pro headphones based on reviews for my Creative Nomad 2C MP3 player which I also got from Amazon. I don't think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the MP3 format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use. Although they are not as accurate as my Grado SR 60 phones, they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go. For small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed. They bass is very good. So good in fact that I turned down the bass EQ on my MP3 player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby. The treble is very clean sounding. If you got an MP3 player, do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these. I am pretty picky about sound quality. The Koss Porta Pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight, portable and delivering a musical experience."
522,1,"It works well, but it's a little to sensitive, everytime a truck goes past my house it constantly goes off, the instructions say put tape along the side of it, if that occured, but it still did'nt do any good!"
523,0,I bought 2 of these within a few months of each other because I love this keyboard because of the small size!  It's set up great! One of the best keyboards in the world!  The problem is that the letters/numbers on the keys come off in 3-6 months making the keyboard worthless extremely quickly and then you have to go out and buy new ones. I don't use the keyboards much so the letters and numbers on the keys should not wear-off so quickly but it's a big flaw of this keyboard because its happening with the 2 that I own.
524,0,"I so wanted to like this strap, but I ended up tossing it in the garbage.See, I bought this German strap years ago, and it has been the best strap ever.  But the label fell off, so I've been searching for another one.  I hoped this Op/Tech was its equal.  Both are neoprene straps with quick connects.  But the German strap has ""skin"" neoprene on one side, which means it NEVER slips off my shoulder.  Sadly, the Op/Tech strap has nylon fabric on both sides and constantly slips off my shoulder.  I almost dropped my Nikon quite a few times.  Bad design for the way I carry my Camera.  I tore the nylon off one side and solved the problem, but now the strap looks like junk.  Not the way a pro wants to look.But worse - the cheap plastic devices that attach the strap to the camera are too large, too stiff and always - always get in the way.  And after a while I got tired of being forced to move those darn things out of the way so I could shoot.  I give up.  Into the trash it goes.Op/Tech doesn't tell you about these things, and give few details about the construction, so I can't tell if I should try another of their straps or not.  The ones with the Pro Loop attachments may be better, but most of those have large, thick shoulder straps.  That type is hard to pack in my already overflowing bag, so I will pass on Op/Tech.  Hopefully they will see the light and resolve these problems.  It's not hard.  But my advice is to pass on this strap and keep looking."
525,2,"I bought this camera 5 months ago and am pretty satisfied with it. The pictures it takes is of very high quality and it compresses it to JPEG by default. There is also a million options you can tinker with the get the picture you want. Do yourself a favor and pick yourself up a 64+ Meg Compact Flash Card, NIMH Rechargable Batteries and Charger plus a Kodak Lens Cleaning Pen. You will definitely need all of it. My only gripe about this camera is that it is kinda heavy and also the lens cap keeps on falling off."
526,2,"Works great for our Rebel T1i!  As I had read, you do need to be in front of the camera and have line of sight.  I love the 2 second delay in order to hide the remote in family shots.  Easily clips to camera strap."
527,0,"The radio has a pretty good tuner and its nice being able to tune in .05 Mhz increments (e.g. 89.45 Mhz for our local PBS radio station).  My C Crane radio has spent almost its whole life on the refrigerator, with probably only 8 trips to live by the washing machine where I fold my laundry, and work on bicycle parts.Despite the fact that I seldom move this radio, the LCD display went bad after 18 months and now I cannot see anything while tuning.  Moreover, one of the springs in the battery compartment broke off and now its quite difficult to remove and change batteries.  And, this is after recharging the batteries maybe 10 times total in the life of the radio.Tuner quality gets a 5.  Tunes like the $130 radio that it is.Build quality gets a 1.  Built like a $13 radio, seriously.overall quality is 2.5, which I rounded down to two stars."
528,1,"Kinda flimsy but works well with a very small camera and attachment (light, mic, etc.)"
529,2,"Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price."

531,0,"Device recognized by Win7 64 bit, however would not work.  Was not able to find a driver that specifically states Win7, CD and SW online specifies driver supplied is Win98SE.  Yikes.

532,0,"So here's the thing, when I lived in Phoenix, and I had this certain cable internet provider, and it worked. Granted I had a bit of trouble getting it to work right off the bat. But, then it worked, and that was that.Then I move to Albuquerque, and this other cable internet provider, and I could not get it to work. I even called Netgear, and even though the guy on the line was very nice, and very helpful, it still wouldn't work!I finally went down to the store, and got myself a new router by a different manufacturer, and that one worked. &lt;shrug>"
533,0,"This unit installed fairly easily. I mounted it in a first floor closet where it now provides an excellent signal to the entire first and second floors (my base wireless router takes care of the family room floor in the basement).HOWEVER, I find that I constantly have to power it on and off to get my portables back online when they have been ""asleep"" for awhile - so frequntly that I installed a power bar in the closet just so I wouldn't have to unplug the Access Point to reboot it. None of the standard approches to ""fix"" the connection from the computers themselves works. One portable is an IBM using XP while the other is an HP using Vista, so it's apparently not an operating system or hardware issue. Besides these same computers did not have this problem connecting to my base router (also a Lynksys, although older), before I bought the Access Point."
534,0,"This is an *extremely* thick cable for RCA audio.  It looks very durable, but noticeably colored the sound with a loss of treble. I was connecting an Echo indigo sound card (through the line out) to a Little Dot MK V Headphone amp.  Stuck with the stock mini-rack to RCA adapter that came with the Echo Indigo and sound was much better.  It may be that if you have an exceptionally powerful line-out you won't experience a treble rolloff, but I sure did."
535,2,"cool material, and it fits good.  protects well, but it is sort of bulky to have hanging off your person or to jam into a backpack with precious space."
536,2,"I'm in my 24th year as host of a radio show on NPR-San Francisco. These are the headphones I've been using for the past four years: Great sound quality and as important, very light and comfortable on the ear, so I can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable. If you want to look like a pro, these aren't for you. They look like what a teeny-bopper would wear. But if you want an amazing combination of sound quality, comfort, and low cost, these are great."
537,0,"This remote has no indicator to let you know if it's transmitting to the camera. I expected more from a nikon product, like a light indicator or a vibrate etc. You just have to hold still to see if the picture is going to take.  Also, it does not work well if obsticles are in the way of it. I was only a few ft away & was slightly behind a column & it would not take the picture. I don't want the wu-1 connector b/c I like to use a discrete remote when I'm taking pictures of my husband & me. I don't know what I'm going to do about a remote..."
538,1,"For smaller, lighter weight satellites (I'm guessing 4 lbs or less), these are a really good deal.  As other reviewers have said, they come with a lot of hardware for different types of speakers, including a key-hole adapter.  However, for heavier speakers that come close to the manufacturer's stated limit (8 lbs), these aren't great.  I just hung 4 Infinity Primus 140's with these.  The 140's are 7 lbs and physically bulky.  First, you must get the Allen screws at each of the pivot points very, very tight (without cracking the plastic).  The tilting pivot (for pointing the speakers down) is next to impossible to get tight enough to hold a heavy speaker up.  When you do get it tight enough, the entire bracket flexes from the torque put on the joint by the weight of the speaker.  Instead of letting the pivot hold the weight, I put spacers between the wall and the bottom of the speaker.  (This is for the wall mounting configuration.)  I'm pretty sure the ceiling mount would be completely unsafe/unreliable for this reason.  In my installation, I will likely put a secondary strap on the speaker and the wall to ensure that the speaker doesn't come crashing down if the mount fails (or if one of the joints comes loose).  Also, for a heavy speaker, mount these into studs!That being said, I'm pretty sure these are perfect for small, lightweight sats.  My advice is to buy only one and try it out with your sats before you buy a set."
539,1,"These headphones sound very nice, but they squeeze my head so tight they are almost immediately uncomfortable when I am wearing my glasses.  They squeeze the arms of my glasses between my ears and my head and are very uncomfortable within minutes.  I have to wear them only partially over my ears to avoid that problem, and then the noise isolation is poor.  They are reasonably comfortable when I'm wearing my contacts.Also, based on the thickness of the padding, it looks as though they would have great sound isolation.  However, I was surprised at how much of the audio from the headphones is audible to others around me.  I, on the other hand, don't have much trouble drowning out outside noise when wearing the headphones."
540,0,"I tried these with V-MODA Crossfades.  The sound from these was clearly not as good as the crossfades.  However, I did love the long cord and the padded top headpiece.  However, the ear pieces ended up putting pressure around my jawline, and after about 30 minutes it was really starting to hurt."
541,0,"Am using a KVM which is only DVI - which for most desktop type cases these days is fine.  HOWEVER the two laptops I have that I'd want the option of using on one port are only VGA / HDMI.  This DID NOT work, there was no signal pass through at all.  i see it has worked for some others...  maybe the local computer store guy can hook it up for someone and make them happy...  too cheap to pay to return it."
542,0,"Try as I may - and I have really, really tried - the Terk Indoor AM Antenna ADVANTAGE does nothing for my AM reception.  My clock radio does not have a receptor for the wire attachment, so I have tried the antenna beside the radio, atop the radio, behind the radio ... turned every which way ... dialed every which way ... I did not try it standing on my head.  I have to face it - this gizmo just does not work for me."
543,1,Purchased this item as it is from Sony.  In less than a month the adapter started to make a loud whirring mechanical noise in my car's cassette deck. Other cassettes don't do the same.  Getting a replacement in the hopes that I had a defective item.
544,1,"I'm using the WPS 11 on a dual platform (XP and Apple OS X) wireless LAN connected to a cable modem via an Apple Airport set up as a DHCP router providing NAT to 5 workstations (2 XP, 1 W98, 2 Mac).  Setting up the WPS 11 is every bit as daunting as many of the other reviews of this product claim.  My biggest problem was getting Windows and Apple printing protocols to work together.  The Win setup is fairly OK following the manual BUT ..... depending on the rest of your wireless network you could spend a lot of time chasing little problems.  The WPS 11 defaults to channel 6.  That's OK if you're using a Linksys router/access point.  If not, you have to move the radio channel, or you'll think it's dead.  Setting up via the ethernet port and then re-powering in order to scan the wireless LAN is another problem, but if you let it get a DHCP address from your router and you've got the right radio channel you should be able to access the box from the web admin or the &quot;Biadmin&quot; utility wirelessly.  The easiest way to set up Apple printing is through IP printing.  With the OS X /Unix drivers available from  Gimp-Print you should be able to get almost any printer working.  I started with on old Deskjet 560C just to make sure everything was working, before I ordered a new laser printer.  Linksys could save their tech staff (which I didn't call) and their customers a LOT of grief if they'd put a few sample configurations in the manual and provided a few resource links.  The paltry set of Apple utilities in the Linksys disk are in a folder called &quot;unsupported&quot; and mainly pertain to AppleTalk under OS 9.  Don't bother.  Go straight for IP printing.  Linksys doesn't even tell you the default queue name ( &quot;lp&quot; worked) and it's all the little stuff like that which keeps this from being a 5.  When you get it working, it's great and the price can't be beat, but it's really nowhere near up to the state of the plug and play art with either Windows or Apple products.  On the plus side, you can adminster the server from an embedded web utility over wireless, so if you're all Apple, you actually can get it running.  Just push the reset button while connected to a printer and the box will print it's diags, including current IP address.  Point a browser there and you're in. Again, this is not well documented and if you're using a wireless machine, be sure to note the radio channel and reset your WiFi card to the same frequency.  I can see why people just send them back though, and for any 'dead radio' issues, be sure all your wireless devices are on the same channel.  Lastly, if this server is part of a wireless LAN and not used stand alone, you MUST set it as an infrastructure device, not ad-hoc.  Again, poorly documented. I found this by reading the Help file in the Bi-admin utility and it's burried deep.  As a rule, always get a diag printout using a short push of the reset button, and make sure the IP address and radio channels match up. This will solve a lot of problems. Linksys products are robust and reliable, and I'm sure now that it's working the WPS 11 will be too."
545,0,"Had these for a little while, worked well at first. I rarely used them and already one of the circular pieces (the thing with all the tiny holes on it) came off one of the headphones. I tried to place it back in but it keeps falling out and irritates my ear."
546,0,"The product is still reliable and functional. Just understand that it is an edition of the Airport Extreme that was replaced by the newer white boxy looking 802.11N gigabit access point more than two years ago. I'm of the opinion that some of this old Apple stuff will has enduring value in it's very design. It's a router disguised as a Hershey Kiss!! Way cool, but way slow too. I've never even heard of two of it's standards, anyone know what WAP-EN or Fast-EN is? Hey, its probably fine for E-mail, and it is way cool! I'll give it another star. Now if they just made one in a funky seafoam color!"

551,1,"For the price, these phones are ok. But let me tell you, if you think they're gonna be accurate at reproducing sound, you'll be disappointed. They are exceptionally bass heavy, and that bass is muddy as can be. Highs are rolled off, and mids are lost in the sonic distortion caused by the overwhelming bass frequencies.I haven't tried other phones in this price range (these came with another product I bought), but I wouldn't buy them if I needed to. I'd look elsewhere."
552,2,They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.
553,0,I installed this on my mac duel g4 tower. it worked randomly for about 2 weeks.
554,0,I did not actually use this surge protector. I was looking for something that I felt would be better protecting my equipment.
555,0,"When I received this coupler it was unable to accept a 3.5mm plug in either end because it had been poorly assembled.  To get it working, I had to bend the internal contacts into the correct position with a needle.  It now transmits the signal, but the enclosure is so flimsy and the internals are so badly secured that attached cords need to remain stationary or they will quickly fall out of the plug.I would not consider this item a long-term fix for any situation."
556,2,"Original Review: I'm getting ready for a three week trip with a lot of flying to South America, so I thought I'd read the reviews for all the noise cancelling headphones out there and ended up buying the Sennheiser PXC250s.... they sound decent, but compared to my cheapo Koss PortaPros, they SUCK.The KOSS PortaPro is simply the best lightweight travel headphone I've ever owned.  I'm not sure why they're so retro looking, but they're really comfortable and sound like high end headphones without being giant monsters... the sound quality and the bass and volume levels are amazing.Don't question yourself... buy these and try them out and you'll be extremely happy that you did!!!!Updated: 2011....  Wow, I can't believe I bought these in 2003!  The earpads, after almost 8 years, need replacement.  That's it.  They still sound amazing when I put them on and they make music oh so enjoyable compared to earbuds... not even $500 earbuds sound as good as these little $30ish 1970s looking headphones... and they're now actually just retro enough looking and to me say ""hey, those must sound awesome because they're sorta ugly"" so I wear them proudly. Don't hesitate... plus you have 30 days to try them out, that's why Amazon is so awesome."
557,2,"While not the use most likely intended for this Koss device, I purchased it for my mom so she could control the sound from her TV whether to a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker in her lap. It's perfect, and allows her to keep her own personal volume while not having the TV set itself so loud as to blast out the rest of the room. I have also tried it on my iPod, and it's a much more convenient way to trim the volume than fumbling for the touch screen or wheel. I believe the claims on the box to &#34;boost the volume&#34; of your personal device may be less than accurate, at least in my case, but it certainly works well enough for the obvious purpose."
558,1,"This headphone has very good audio quality but after 5-10 minutes it is very uncomfortable to wear. I am starting to have headaches on the side of my head above the ears after that time.I have had it for the past 12 months and now I dread wearing it. I am 5'9"" with average sized head. Try this before you get this. It does not stretch with time."
559,0,"When I heard about the Tungsten T I was very excited and new I had to buy it. But after I had some time with the unit, I found out how little it truely offered, especially compared to other handhelds in the high-end price range.The Tungsten does have a very good screen, and the colors are beautiful. That alone is the only reason I could see why people bought the unit, because a great color screen is the only thing this has going for it. It has multimedia capabilities, but none are included in the box, and after all the excitement of having a Realplayer on the Palm, guess what? Palm reps have said dont expect too much, to paraphrase them, which leaves the audio capabilities in question.This unit is much better than their previous high-end m515, but like I said, it just does not have enough to compete with the Sony Clie line, or the recent new PPC devices that are much cheaper. I won't offer much in the way of the graffiti slider, because that is personal preference, but let me tell you, it gets very old having to slide it all the time to write down quick notes.If you are quesioning buying a new high-end PDA, look elsewhere. You can do a lot more with multimedia on a Pocket PC or Clie, and if you just want a good organizer, I'd recommend an OS4.1 device, because any Clie will do, or even the m515 if you can live with low-res will be more useful then this. Bluetooth is nice, but other PDA's have it or offer expansion cards, so it isnt a big advantage that some make it out to be."
560,0,Bought 2 of these and they both worked for a day.  2nd day one started getting flakey.  Works for about 3 minutes after power cycling.  I'm not a happy camper.  These felt much heftier than my previous DLink 10/100 switches.  Not much good if they don't work.  I'm going to return one under warranty and hopefully the new one works.  I need 3 more but I won't buy any more Netgear products until I get more satisfaction. Buy with caution!

The TrendNet has a 5-year warranty which is pretty decent.SUMMARY:Stay away from these GS models.  The GS1xx line seems to have a 50% failure rate after 6 months of power-on time.  For twice the cost, NetGear has a larger, fan-cooled version (JGS1xx).  Trendnet has a better product for half the cost."
562,0,"I had an older RP614V2 that was sacrificed to the lightning gods.  I replaced it with a new RP614V4.After much trouble caused by their idiotic choice of 192.168.1.1 as a base address ( where the normal default, and previous default, were 192.168.0.1 ), I got everything working again ( as 192.168.0.1 ).This POS router drops all LAN side connections anywhere from once a day to once every ten minutes.

566,2,This is an excellent security cable. Long enough to allow one to secure your laptop to something large or fixed to the room construction.

567,0,"I bought this accessory about 5 years ago to connect my TiVO to a wired internet connection.  It was the only such adapter available at BestBuy when I bought it.  It worked well but the design is poor in that it does not keep a reliable connection and once the door breaks off (which eventually will happen, it is not very rugged), no amount of duct tape will salvage it.I am trying a D-Link adapter next - hopefully with more reliable results.01/07/2010 UPDATE:  I have been using my D-Link adapter for several months now and it works like a champ and is much better quality."

569,1,I received this item before the estimated arrival date. I haven't used it yet since it's a cleaning cassette and the camcorder I bought along with it is brand new. It will be some time before I use it and be able to give a proper rating. But I loved the transaction.

I had been using a VGA cable with an adapter on my PC, but wanted to push my TV so it was flush with the entertainment center (the DVI to VGA cable prevented this as it was on the back of the PC)  This cable would have been perfect if it had worked!  I tried several DVI cables that I knew worked, and no signal at all.  I am returning this to Amazon today..."
571,0,"I was expecting better, keeping the good Netgear reputation in mind. However, I was very disappointed by the reception. My computer that I used this card in, is no more than 30 feet from the router, which has proven itself to me in many ways. But, the wireless Netgear card's reception stinks! Signal quality and strength typically stays around 20-30%, and 35% if I'm lucky. This was not the case with certain USB wireless cards and the Linksys PCI Wireless network card. I attribute the poor reception to the small size of antenna. The Linksys counterpart has a much larger one and receives wireless signal much better.I strongly recommend you not buy this item and go with the Linksys counterpart."
572,1,"I am a big fan of Linksys products. They've always been very affordable and get the job done. However, I would have to say this is my least favorite Linksys product. I bought it figuring it would look good on the ""stack"" with my Linksys router, switch and wireless AP.Overall it works relatively well. However, in certain situations I ran into issues. If you run connection intensive applications that open many connections, the modem does have a tendency to lock up. Cycling power seems to correct this. I've seen other people post similar issues with connection dropping in certain situations. I am a software developer and often run applications that will open many simultaneous connections, so this was an issue for me. I have since switch modems and no longer have this issue.Overall it works well, just requires the occasional shutdown/startup to clear it out."
573,0,"This switch did not work, this product would mute in reverse..., I could not hear the person on the other end, but they could still hear me! not good. Dont know why, followed instructions and tried multiple configurations. This product would be great if you did not want to hear the other party, but for some reason you still wanted them to hear you.Wish I could get me money back."
574,0,I would not buy another one from this company regardless of the model.And may not anything period. They cost two much to throw away. I also used the powersupply that came with it so low power didn't cause it to go nuts.
575,2,"This is a handy and inexpensive little device.  A convenient way to ""tweak"" your volume level.  Works fine. No complaints.  Like all headphone cables it doesn't like to be rolled over by chair rollers, stomped on or yanked out of the socket.  If you treat it with moderate care, it ought to last for years."
576,1,"Many people give these headphones pretty good reviews, which is why I bought them five months ago. Initially, I liked them. With time and use, the luster has worn off. I continue to regard them as a fairly good value for the money, but they are in no way good or excellent headphones. After three months, I bought a pair of HD555's to replace them on my sound system. I continued to use them on my iMac but am now planning to replace them altogether with HD428's on that system.At best, these headphones are suitable only for occasional use as lightweight phones on a mobile device like an iPod. Over the past five months, I have come to these conclusions about the 202's:1. Comfort. While the 202's are more comfortable for me than ear buds, for instance, they cannot approach the comfort of a well-designed set of phones like the 555's. The ear cushions are not as snug and seem ill-fitting and somewhat harder than I would like. The headband requires constant adjusting, and the action is poor. Extended use of the phones is not very comfortable.2. Construction. These are flimsy plastic headphones. Over time, I have found that they tend to pull apart rather easily, so I am constantly trying to piece them back together. Simple things like the cord routing are poor--I am constantly stepping on the cord and snagging it.3. Sound field. The 202's have a somewhat constrained sound field compared to the 555's, which are much more expansive.4. Response. Although the frequency response looks good on paper, in practice the sound from these phones is just not as rich with either the resonance or harmonics of better headphones.5. Downmixing. For headphone use, my receiver downmixes eight channels into two. This comes through as distorted sound on the 202's. The 555's, in contrast, have no difficulty with downmixing."
577,2,"I found that CB is not as useful as it was 35 years ago for travel.  On a recent cross country trip it helped me find out what was causing 2 major traffic delays, but in both cases it did not give me a timely warning to avoid them.  Still, it's nice to have as a back up."
578,0,"I've had my Ique (aka Betty) for several years. It's helped me to go across the US several times, and then some. It has its quirks, and frequent crashes, etc - it's definitely not a turn-it-on-and-forget-it gadget. However, like the previous reviewer said, their software is not Vista-compatible - meaning, you can't sync your data (incl. map source) with your PC, rendering it useless unless you stick with XP! As far as I know, neither Palm nor Garmin plans to make the Palm Desktop Vista compatible anytime soon - which probably signals the end of the wonderful Palm OS... :("
579,0,"My Dell Dimension XPS 400 Windows 98 SE has the Linksys WMP54GS card in it and it works perfectly. (The first time I installed it!) This computer has a modem and didn't have a wired ethernet card.After trying the D-Link DWL-G520 AirPlus Xtreme G Wireless PCI Adapter 108Mbps card, which worked only once (after disabling the Dial Up modem) the Linksys card was the only card that the computer recognized, didn't freeze up during boot, and that connected to the wireless router the first time.With the WMP54GS, the dial up modem is still installed and enabled.I didn't have such good luck with my Compaq Deskpro P500 Windows 98 SE computer.This card stopped the computer during boot up, even before the screen shows the memory test. Something very serious happened during the bootup sequence that locked up the machine.It appears that older computers, especially Compaq, have unique charateristics that preclude using newer cards (read: cards with higher speeds). It might be in the BIOS that recognizes cards, it might be bus speed, it might be the use of PCI connector pins, it might be the operating system, it might be the incompatibility with the cards driver. I don't feel compelled to diagnose what is wrong.After 3 weekends trying to get the D-Link DWL-G520 AirPlus Xtreme G Wireless PCI Adapter 108Mbps card to work in the Compaq, I bought and simply tried several major brand cards (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear) for 54 Mbs and 11 Mbs until I found one that worked. That card was the Linksys WMP11. It works perfectly. (The rest are being returned - sorry about that AMAZON.)An installation quirk: In the Compaq, using the Linksys WMP11, I had a strong signal, and it reported it was connected to the Internet. but my computer couldn't connect to the internet.I determined that the wired Ethernet adapter in the Compaq was causing a problem, and capturing during bootup the TCP/IP connection before the wireless modem had a chance.The way I checked what was connected to TCP/IP in your computer is to RUN winipcfg and see what is in the dropdown box. If the WMP54GS or WMP11 (or whatever wireless card you installed) description isn't there, then the computer can't use it to connect to the internet.The dial up modem is still installed and enabled in both computers. That did not stop the WMP11 in the Compaq or the WMP54GS in the Dell from working.HINT: The wired Ethernet adapter is no longer in the Compaq. I am saving it though because that wired adapter is the one I used to connect via hardwire to Comcast, and it has the MAC address that I cloned into the Linksys router. I'll reinstall it and connect it to the router if I need to re-do the setup for the modem to the Comcast internet connection.Looking back, it appears that the newer wireless lan cards are throughly tested on Windows XP and Windows 2000 computers (the install is usually much easier according to my wealthier friends) and minimally tested on Windows 98 SE and Windows ME computers.Linksys apparently spent the time debugging the drivers and the resident modules on Windows 98 SE so it knows how to handle an existing dial up modem.D-Link apparently didn't. For the D-Link DWL-G520 AirPlus Xtreme G Wireless PCI Adapter 108Mbps card(the only high speed card for which both computers booted up successfully at least once) I had to disable the modem (entry in network and modem in My Computer - Devices)to get it work at all, albeit fitfully and ultimately not sufficiently to serve its intended purpose."
580,0,"I am going return this item. It on occasion will repeat keystrokes from the keyboard. This just irritating when typing a document but the other day I hit the delete key to erase an email and it chose at that time to repeat and started deleting all my other email. I ended up having to recover over 20 emails that the repeating key had deleted before I got it to stop ( by madly depressing the offending key ) Amazon is pretty good and sent me a replacement but as it turns out it wasn't that the first one I purchased was bad, there is a flaw in the device design itself. After reading other low reviews I learned that this has been a problem in the past."
581,0,"I gave my Nikon digital to my daughter when I purchased the Olympus because I wanted a camera that was more 'weatherproof'.  We spend quite a bit of time at the beach and involve ourselves in some watersports (kayaking).  I did not feel comfortable with having the Nikon even near anything wet.  Upon examining the Olympus, I suspected that its 'weatherproofness' was pretty weak.  The hatch covers for the battery and usb port are quite flimsy and way too easy to open accidentally.  Although the covers do have 'o' ring type seals, it was obvious these will not hold back nominal splashing water.  Also, the lens slide is very vulnerable to sand -- so taking the slide off and cleaning the slide grooves has become routine. Mechanically, the camera just seems cheap --unlike the less expensive Nikon that feels solid.Using the camera is much more involved than the Nikon.  I didn't appreciate Nikon's menu setup/controls until I used the Olympus.  It drove me nuts  -- and still does.On the plus side, the pics seem fine.  And unlike other reviewers, I find the battery life is pretty good.  I do have a couple of back up batteries that are always charged, so no problem. The chip holds lots of pics.I have had many regular Olympus cameras in the past (all 35mm) and have always thought highly of Olympus quality.  Olympus just did not meet the standards I expected when it came to this camera."
582,1,"I've had some things go missing form my car port, so i bought this to try and catch the guy(s). Setup was easy. But it seems it can be defeated by walking fast by it. If I walk slow enough, it will sound the alarm. If I walk my normal pace it misses me every time. i would think a thief would be scuttling in the carport pretty fast to avoid being seen by a neighbor. So I don't think it will work for my proposes. Maybe a car is big enough that it won't have any trouble. I gave it 3 stars, the receiver should come with an a/c adapter since it has the spot for one. Try and find a 4.5 volt adapter with a barrel plug on it big enough. I'm stuck paying $8 for C cell batteries when they run down."
583,1,"I have been very pleased with the sound quality of the HD-212Pro headphones. The bass is as good as everyone says and the rest is quite clear, sharp and balanced... especially in this price range. The headset is comfortable to wear and I experienced minimal discomfort after 3 or more hours of use.However, after three years in my studio the foam around the ear cups and the foam pad that contacts the top of the head has decomposed. It has all melted and turned sticky and it comes off and sticks to skin, hair, glass, wood, metal, etc. It is difficult to clean off. These headphones ended up costing me about $20/year to use. I was hoping to get more use from them. I rate them 4.5-stars for sound quality but only 2-stars for quality of materials/value."
584,1,"I read the glowing reviews here and decided to upgrade from my CD-only player.  I didn't like the fact that it makes alot of noise when ""pre-loading"" the CD, and it does take about 20 seconds and even longer for a CDRW to do so.  It is just as flat as my normal CD player, but it is much wider too.  Another reason why I don't give this a 5-star rating is that the equalizer is pretty ....  Forget about any DSP surround sound you get with just listening to MP3s on your PC with a Sound Blaster sound card.  Not even the simple DSP settings I got with my CD player like live and extra bass.  Everything just sounds like FM radio.  But I guess you don't need that when you're outdoors with all the noise anyhow.  It is extremely convenient to have 150 songs on one CD and the playlist ability, but you sacrifice a little quality for alot of convenience.  Still very good buy for the price."
585,0,"I purchased the Belkin Bluetooth F8T001 USB Adapter so that I could synch my IPAQ 1945 PDA.  However, after software installation, I could only get ""BTTray:  Incorrect License type"" and ""Error - Unable to start Stack Service.""When I contacted Belkin Tech Support, I was told that the problem was caused by the Microsoft Service Pack 2.  According to Belkin, Microsoft has included their own version of Bluetooth in SP2, and it is not compatible with the Belkin adapter.  When I asked for their suggestions, they replied that I should ""uninstall SP2.""  They told me that SP1 ""works with some devices,"" and XP works with everything.  I asked when they were going to update their drivers to work with this adapter, and they said that they didn't know.  ""Microsoft had not yet published their interfaces.""  My feeling was that as far as the company Tech Support was concerned, the device works OK with XP original, so any problems I am having are just my tuogh luck."
586,2,"I bought one of these about 6 weeks ago as I write this, and have fired a couple hundred pictures, and a couple of short videos through it.  Wonderful! It takes great pictures, and the videos (with built-in  microphone) are pretty cool, too. While the controls seemed a little  unwieldy at first, once I pulled out the manual, I needed less than an hour  to go through the options and see how everything works, which isn't too bad  of a learning curve at all. The LCD viewer is great - I can edit and delete  images while shooting, thus saving some precious memory stick space.  I  have appreciated that the LCD viewscreen can also be swiveled around  laterally and vertically, even to point forward, so I can take a picture of  myself and, at the same time, see myself in the viewfinder.  Brilliant! The  flash does a great job of illuminating scenes.  The camera also offers  ability to adjust for white based on indoor, outdoor, or &quot;other&quot;  conditions (sounds dumb, I know, to have &quot;other&quot;, but trust me,  it makes sense).  This is my first USB peripheral, and I have to say I am  impressed - I can pull down a full 32MB memory stick pretty darn quick, and  it's really nice being able to plug the USB port in *while the computer is  on*, and immediately use it without any software hassles. I have to admit  to a certain awe at Microsoft for actually pulling it off with win98.  You  can use the software that comes with the camera, but I have not, since you  will find better image handling, organizing, and altering software as  freeware, shareware, or expensive (like photoshop) professional  stuff.Another super aspect of this camera is the battery - it is  removable, but it is rechargable, and the camera comes with a DC-in jack  and it's own external power supply, so you can plug the camera into the  wall, and recharge that battery for another 2.0-2.5 hours of use.  No more  buying scads and scads of Earth-killing AAs. This is such a simple built-in  to add, and such a highly useful extra, I really have to question why every  digitial camera doesn't do this.On the downside, the viewfinder is very,  very difficult to see when outside; sometimes impossible to see.  And, of  course, please realize that this camera is a point-and-shoot (albeit a  functional one), so changing lenses is *not* an option, nor is having much  control over f-stop or shutter speed - you will have some control, but the  f-stop and shutter speed ranges are not are not what you might be used to.  I also think that, overall, its senstivity to white is not as good as it  should be - my whites tend to end up a bit grey; not much, but a bit.  But  I have to admit I dont know if that's the camera, or a problem with the  really hazy NYC days we've had and/or from shooting inside in rooms with a  mix of flourescent and incandescent lighting.Overall, I am impressed  with this camera, I'm very glad I bought it (and not a different one), and  while it is not 3 megapixels, unless you plan to make large prints of your  images, the resolution on this camera is far higher than you need for  web-image making, and high enough for anything else. It's small, easy to  carry, easy to use, easy to download, and easy to recharge. For the money,  this is, in my opinion, your best deal for a non-professional 2 megapixel  digital camera."
587,0,"This is a nice USB hub. It doesn't have a bunch of annoying LEDs; just one to indicate that it has power. It worked great, right up until the two high-amperage ports died (no power, no data connection). I've had this product for exactly one month and one day, so I'm one day outside the return window for Amazon.I would like to some things change in future versions:1) Don't fail after a month (I'm sure it's not common, but it's still frustrating)2) Longer power cable. I bought this because I want ports accessible from up on my desk. The power cable hardly reaches and cannot be routed the way I would like to route it.3) Add mounting holes on the bottom. I would like to have mounted it on the underside of the edge of my desk.----Update: I bought another one of these to replace the one that stopped working. It's started exhibiting the same failure condition that the last one did. I get power from the high-amperage ports, but no data. If this behaves like the last one, power will also stop working on those ports, soon.Something is wrong with these."

590,1,"I bought this when I got a car that only had a tape deck and I wanted to play my iPod through the stereo.  The sound quality is not that great, but that is understandable.  Probably a little better than one of those FM transmitters we used to have to use back in 2006, I hated those things!  Anyway, it did the job for a few months until I saved up enough scratch to put a iPod-ready stereo in my car.  I then passed it on to my dad, but he reported that it stopped working shortly afterward."
591,1,Unit worked well for a month then receiver died. Even with external power supply I still can't get the receiver to work
592,2,"I have one of these between my CarPC and AMP input.  The soundcard was putting out to much power, turning the volume up to 10 out of 100 on the PC would almost blow the speakers.  This thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the PC volume.  I haven't noticed any sound quality loss though I dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail."
593,1,"I had a Belkin Wave keyboard before this Microsoft Elite one, so perhaps this wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't know that a better alternative exists.  The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is easy to type on - the keys feel light and you don't need to use too much pressure.  The main problem I have (and something I wish I realized *before* I purchased the keyboard) is the placement of the 6 number key.  On the Belkin wave keyboard, the 6 is placed so that you can reach it with your right hand, just as you would on a standard keyboard.  On the Microsoft Elite keyboard, the 6 is placed on the left-hand side.  It basically means that I have to re-program my typing so that I go for the 6 with my left hand, even though I've been typing a 6 for the majority of my life with the right hand.  Every time I try to type a 6 on the Microsoft keyboard, I grumble inside, because I *always* try with the index finger of the right hand first.  If I had known about this key placement issue before buying the keyboard, I wouldn't have bought this model."
594,0,I have been a Canon fan for years but a friend recommended the 5700. After only a few hundred pictures the flash stopped working and my friend said that he now has the same problem.

596,1,"Bought the Klipsch 2.1 speaker system in a retail store, not on Amazon.  Previously owned computer sound systems include a 2.1 Monsoon system and a powered Sony 2.0 speaker system (wood cabinet); the Sony is the better sounding of the two.The reviews on Amazon provided useful suggestions and information on these speakers.  A few reviews contained suggestions about modifying aspects of the sound quality such as plugging the bass port to subdue the very prominent low-end.  There are also many reviews stating that these speakers lack mid-range; this is very true.My system had the same problem another reviewer had with the right satellite speaker cutting out.  After messing around with the configuration, I discovered that the satellite speaker with the controls on it seems to work fine when connected as the left speaker (but has a cutout problem when connected as the right speaker).  Being right handed, I originally configured it as the right speaker."
597,0,"I purchased the 4-port desktop USB 2.0 hub.They changed logo, design, and most-importantly to me, they changed the LEDs from blue to red.  I didn't even bother opening it.  You can't trust the other reviews, since this is a revised/different product.Everything I have is silver (aluminum case) with blue LEDs (monitor, etc.).  I bought this overpriced, simple device based on it being able to match.  It doesn't.Most of the reviews here are from 5 to 10 years old.  They are for a different product/revision."

599,0,"I picked up this lens primarily to shoot at night, or in darker areas with my 60D. When I got it I was blown away by just how great it was for the price!I purchased this on Jan. 13th 2011 and used it quite a lot in 3 months.Fast forward to May 8th 2011.  Reaching into my bag to pull the lens out, the entire front of the lens came apart from the rest of it!The build feels like total garbage.  It feels like a toy lens, but without the indestructible-ness of a solid toy!  I was shopping around and decided on a canon because it was a first party lens, and I assumed the build would be better.  After looking around the inside i could see the grooves in which it separated from.  After a little bit of fiddling i was able to get the lens back into one piece again but now the auto focus is totally unresponsive at all!  Hopefully canon can do something for me with this as im trying to send it off to them, but since its past the 90 day mark I'm not holding my breath.  Be warned, it really is great when it works but there's a reason why people call this the iffy fifty.I am totally disappointed in this product, and would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting the quality of a solid lens."
600,0,"Bought three of these for the low price and the Panasonic name.But people whom I call ALL tell me that the sound of my voice - via the headset's microphone - is awful.

602,0,"I've owned a few Archos products, and I still use the slim 20GB portable hard disk on a daily basis.  But I cannot recommend Archos products, because, two years after they started selling here stateside, their quality control and customer support are still very, very poor.While not a looker, the Jukebox Multimedia looks good on paper, with MPEG4/DiVX support (although you need to convert the files, a tedious process) and expandability.  As you can tell from the picture it's quite bulky.  What's interesting is, it's actually smaller than it looks, but heavier, too, the exact opposite of the RCA RD2840 40GB Personal Jukebox, which I recommend for its 40GB capacity, great price point, and good quality.  I cannot recommend the Archos at all, read on.First, the screen on this thing is really small.  Tiny!  Don't expect to watch video more than a couple times.  Once the novelty factor wears off -- and it'll only take a few minutes -- you'll want to shun watching anything on the small screen, even JPEG pictures.  (Sorry, Larry, no carry-anywhere porn viewer for you yet.)  There are no details on the videos and pictures, and the LCD screen eats battery fast, very fast.Second, Archos really, really, really needs to improve their quality.  I bought my first unit on a Saturday, it broke the next day, I took it back for an exchange, then by Tuesday the second one would not turn on.  I went back for another exchange, but the very next day the third unit developed a heavy vibration midway through a song.  That's it, I returned the unit to store for a full refund.All this time, I did not bother to call Archos tech support, because from my past experience I knew them to be rather useless.  With my compact hard disk, for example, it came with an instruction sheet that had whole sections missing!  When I contacted tech support, they asked me to refer to the missing information on the sheet!  You should take a look at the support section of their website, and you'll see they are not very serious about keeping their customers happy.  (Archos is a French company, FYI.)  If their products were reliable this could be forgiven.  But unfortunately the products are not high-quality at all.So I think if you buy this product you are basically playing with Russian roulette.  You might get a reliable unit; my Archos hard drive and one previous Studio jukebox work fine.  But, then, if you take my advice and check out the RCA 40GB Jukebox, I think you'll save yourself lots of frustration over a not-cheap purchase."

Nikon has added a small piece of metal to block use of other lenses.I wish Nikon would allow other lenses to fit this teleconverter. They claim that the elements will touch. If that is so, then all they need to do is make this teleconverter slightly larger to fit without elements touching.It would have made a great edition to any lens collection."
609,0,I have a customer with three HP2300DN printers that used these 615n cards. With these three printers they now have seven dead 615n cards with the HP acknowledge built in fault. We just recently ordered a set of newer style cards to replace the last three working 615ns in the printers. HP really screwed up on these and did not make it right with their base.

611,0,Like other reviewers I found out the hard way that it does indeed partially block one of the outlets which then can only be used by the smallest plug-head like a lamp cord. I have an AC adapter and a fat TV power cord going into an outlet and I can't use this surge protector with them together. I would need to buy a short extension cord to accommodate the surge protector and even then it would be a tight squeeze into the outlet. The older design was square and fit perfectly. I have an older one on my other TV with the same set-up and it fits fine. Why they changed the design and made it taller is beyond me but they screwed up! Hey Tripp Lite! Ditch the tall design and go back to what works. If it ain't broke don't fix it!
612,0,"Tripp Lite SUPER7 7-Outlet Surge Protector (2160 Joules, 7ft. Cord)AMAZON PRODUCT AVAILABLE AT MOST COMPUTER STORES.I would normally give any Tripp Lite product a 5 star rating but cannot in this individual case.At 69 I really hate to go out in the car and shop in computer stores for things I want even though I have professional accounts with major distributors here in the Northeast...Amazon has changed my shopping experience for the most part and I rarely send anything back but this time I will.While the product probably would be fine under normal circumstances:  PACKAGED PROPERLY before shipping and then having the product work in the most common way in the communications world of we the Technicians this product doesn't live up the normal Tripp lite expectations.It was not packaged properly on all sides to prevent damage to the strip!  It was packaged on the top and sides but not on the most sensitive part, THE BOTTOM.If you are a person that receives almost all the things you buy through UPS or FEDEX you also know that these delivery people are literally running and THROWING boxes of product daily!My package came quickly and the box was not damaged BUT:  WHEN an item of electronics such as a surge strip riding in the back of a truck which rides very hard I have little trust as to the item working properly and CAN NOT KNOW if it can now work correctly.Just as important to me is this is the first time I have ever gotten a quality surge protector that a RED light stands for ""GOOD GROUND"".For those of us who have worked in the Tech industry we like ALL indicator lights to be GREEN meaning everything is working fine that we installed and to go look for the problem elsewhere when a computer or telephone system stops working.Since most of us will forget rather quickly that this particular item is different will we remember that the red light in this case means GOOD????  I know most people including me do not want to make an exception and start making RED start meaning something good as opposed to ""NOT WORKING PROPERLY"" or ""IMPROPERLY GROUNDED"".I have returned the product in favor of using the standard APC or TrippLite products using GREEN for good and RED for NOT WORKING PROPERLY.AMAZON needs to do some work in their description of products being sold especially when speaking of surge strips and in a world where people here in the Northeast get lightning storms frequently with trees falling across lines causing surges but also cars/trucks knocking down power lines with the same result of power spikes.The average person has no idea how often they get a surge because they just are unaware that many other things can cause surges and they are more common in some areas than others.  YOUR SURGE STRIP is one of the most important purchases you will ever make and should not be taken lightly, ever!!"

614,2,"My girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones she's ever had. Call me crazy, but I feel as though they're starting to sound better than my Grado SR-80s too."
615,2,"Well made and works just fine, I have a Cannon EOS 60D and it works well. 5 stars but the cord is way to short. You need to be sitting right next to camera for use. Better than remote for Bulb shots."
616,0,This product did not work any better with the digital converter box than the rabbit ears that came with the old analog TV set.
617,2,"When it comes to notebook physical security you need a device that will deter crimes of opportunity -- such as those presented by leaving your notebook at your desk at work or at a table in a library while you browse the shelves.  If you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief, buy a safe.Most cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use.  If a device is easy to use, then you're more likely to use it and use it properly.  The Kensington system doesn't get much simpler.  It consists of a cable, which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object, and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebook's security slot.Compare the Kensington system with the Curtis 06414 system and you'll probably agree that the Kensington system is far easier to use.  Compare it's 1 piece system to the Curtis system which uses a cable, a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebook's security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable.  That's 3 seperate pieces, a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends on.I've used both the Kensington and the Curtis systems at work and have found the Kensington system to be far easier to use.  I put one key on my keyring, put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go.  With the Curtis system, I had to make use of its storage bag just so I wouldn't lose the individual pieces.  I'm also sure the extra effort required to setup the Curtis system will prevent some people from using the device as much as they should.The Kensington system costs a little more money, but it is definitely worth it.  It's my choice for my personal notebook."
618,0,"(first review)Simply put, this item was DOA, straight out of the box. I attempted all of the following as input devices:* Wii console* VCR* DVD playerand both of the following as displays:* 17"" ViewSonic CRT monitor* 20"" Samsung LCD monitorand regardless of the configuration I got the exact same result -- NO SIGNAL. I will attempt one exchange. If that one is DOA as well, I will get a refund.(after getting the replacement)I would like to amend a prior review where I gave 1 star, saying I would give 0 if I could, because it just didn't work. Well, the replacement does work, and I have successfully run the Wii through the analog port on my 20"" LCD monitor. That's the good news.The bad news:* Piping sound through it is bad. Really bad. Tin cans and a string bad. Fortunately, you don't have to, and I don't any more. You just have to be inventive with your cabling.* The video quality isn't great, but this may be as good as it gets with composite. Results might be better with S-video, but I don't have anything that delivers that. I blame outdated standards here.* It doesn't drive 1024x768 like you may see in the specs, it drives 640x480. This makes the next point all the more confusing...* It doesn't work with my 17"" CRT monitor, which I had intended to turn into a TV with this, a VCR, and a pair of amplified speakers. The monitor works fine on the analog port of the video card, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just doesn't get along with the Video Game Jockey.Also of note is that it sends an output signal even when there is no input signal. This means that if your monitor auto-detects source, it will lock onto the blank-screen analog signal if you try to connect the analog to the Jockey and the DVI to your computer. I can force-switch it, but occasionally it still flips back over to analog (and is guaranteed to if the machine is rebooted), and it won't go to sleep because it's always getting a signal. This can be dealt with by switching the Jockey to use the VGA input, even though I haven't connected anything to it. It does not attempt to drive a blank signal this way. I just have to remember to switch it back before I can use the Wii.In short, it does what it says (other than the 1024x768 part) but it has crappy sound quality and doesn't work with all monitors. 3 stars."
619,2,"I know this product doesn't have the best reviews, but I think it's great!I bought the S2 camera (on Amazon), and this bag works JUST fine with it.I can get the camera, my extra batteries, and the wall adaptor all in the bag just fine :)  It's a very sturdy bag to!  I wouldn't recommend it for a professional though, who has to carry around a lot of camera stuff.  But for me, it worked great, and I recommend it :)"
620,1,"I would recommend that if you are considering this product, you spend the extra [$] and get powered Linksys USB 4-Port Hub (ASIN: B00004Z6PI) instead.What does not appear on Amazon's description, but appears on the back of the packaging is a warning from Linksys that this product may not work with USB devices that draw power through the connection, unless you buy an optional AC adapter add-on ...You see, the USB socket provides both connectivity to other devices, and a low current power supply to those devices that need it -- like, for example, a mouse or a keyboard.If you are attaching only devices that also plug into the wall -- such as a printer or scanner -- this may be a great, cheap solution for you.  But if you need to be able to add on other devices without worrying about whether they can draw power through this un-powered hub, you'd better step up and buy a powered hub.I hope this helps you avoid the mistake I made."
621,2,"I like it for the same reasons stated by other reviewers, so I won't repeat myself here. The part I worry about is something I discovered when I tried to adjust the dividers slightly & tried to rearrange one of them. As the velcro pulled on the fabric along the inner walls when I tried to separate them, the fabric stretched so much that I thought I would tear it. I also wonder how long the fabric will last after years of use and enduring climate changes. However, the outside of the bag is well constructed & provides sufficient space for the amateur camera enthusiast."
622,2,"I love these, they are the best head phones on the market in my opinion. Great sound, cheap, lifetime warranty.As an example: I sometimes use these when I edit movies, while others usually wear these really big and expensive ones from Sennheiser or Sony. One day some guy came over and almost laughed at me for using such small head phones, so I let him give it a try, and he was really impressed.The sound is nice and crispy, plays low mid and high tones equally well. I listen to black and death metal and these work really well for that."
623,0,Not a heavy duty outlet strip.  If it did not cost so much I would have returned.  Found a heavy duty outlet strip at Walmart for less money.  Do not waste your money on this item.
624,0,"This is the worse MP3 player I ever owned, first the batteries are proprietary, not AA as was advertised.  It also skips and out right refused to play some MP3's even after I put them on a brand new CD.  After I did that I put the old CD in a friends MP3 player made by memorex, it worked great.  It's also not any thinner than a normal one.  My recommendation, stay as far away from this frightful thing as possible."
625,2,"Absolutely amazing sound quality for the price.  At first, they may sound a bit bass-heavy compared to other headphones, but once you get used to it, it sounds great.  Powerful and full sound.  I find them super comfortable on the firm setting, but I have a narrow head I think.  The additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level.  They fold up fairly small but it's hard to fit them in the leather bag provided.  I wish they came with a hard case for true protection while traveling.A great product which I would definitely buy again."
626,0,"fell apart within a month of normal use. absolutly the worst keyboard design i have ever seen, and can't be repaired like a regular board."
627,0,"The description for this item (as of 7/21/05) is incorrect, according to Promise Technology's web site (which I really should have checked before I ordered this card and tried to install it), this card only functions as a PCI to ATA 2 channel controller, it has no RAID functionality whatsoever. The descrptions of RAID functions seem to be describing the Promise Technology Fasttrack 100TX2 card. I've notified Amazon about this error, and if they change the description thus saving others from the aggrivation I had, then kindly ignore this review."
628,0,"For the price of the substandard entry level Cosina-made (NOT Nikon! junk for sale here, you can purchase an older, top quality mechanical SLR made by Canon or Nikon in used but nearly new condition, and have enough left over to have it CLA'd by a professional camera tech, and also for a fast normal prime lens and some film. Though buying new is in my experience often the safer bet when it comes to camera equipment, in this case you are simply wasting your money.And if you are not constrained by the need to use a traditional mechanical camera, then, by all means, do not for a moment consider shelling out good money for this junk. Three hundred dollars in 2012 will easily get you into 35mm outfits that cost THOUSANDS less than a decade ago.  Used professional gear beats new mediocre crap hands down in my book."
629,2,"This was such an excellent handheld and the wireless was so easy to use.  It's a shame they gave up on it, and thought that the wireless web abilities in my cell phone was a replacement.  This is anything but the truth.  The Palm VII could get email, news, weather, taxi cabs, book hotels, lookup information in an online dictionary or encyclopedia, and do so much more.  The advantage was that these things could be done within seconds while driving down the highway, in the forest or wherever you were at.  I used this thing very heavily when I was on a vacation in Florida and did so much that would take forever to accomplish with a GPS, cell phone or device with a web browser.  The Palm VII lacked a browser because they are slow and take forever to get information over a device like this.So sad they had to discontinue Palm.net and so sad that the majority of people out there are so ignorant.  This device never caught on with the public.  But it will be forever remembered."
630,0,"Quality didn't seem to be there. I have never seen a punch panel that you terminate a port on both sides of the panel. Turns out I punched it down wrong and had to redo it at 8pm the night before the live date. Keep your wiring scheme in mind. Not a traditional wiring scheme. Also you must work from the middle out, or your terminated wires get in the way of the open ports."
631,2,"I had to buy about 2 of these when I started using them. They are small, efficient but do not last forever. But at the price point, i can afford to buy a couple of replacements once in a while. Recommend for those interested in self portraits or prefer to shoot with controls."
632,2,If you take night picture or close up then mount the cannon camera on a tripod and attach this remote in the slot provided and you would get nice pictures without any shaking or blurr!!
633,2,"Not a lengthy review. Just my 2 to tell everyone who's curious aboutthese KOSS ""Plug's"" as I was a week ago.Very comfy in my ear. Stay put w/o falling-out.GREAT sound, deep bass & I still hear the highs too.Brings my mp3 player ""ALIVE"" at last.The free extra set of ""rubber/foam"" tips is great!Mine came in ""BLACK"", although any of the available colorslook great IMO.I started to buy the newer version of the KOSS earplugscalled the ""SparkPlug"", but after reading alot of userreviews, opted to buy these instead.They are well worth the $14. Don't hesitate if you're considering thisbrand. They have a LIFETIME guarantee (no questions asked).You'll be glad you got them...Hard to believe that some other brands sell for upwards of several hundred dollars.They simply CAN'T sound much (if ANY) better than these do. PERIOD"
634,0,"These are cheap Chinese junk, and didn't last any time at all. I've since purchased others from Belkin made in the U.S. and they have worked without any problems for over a year. Pay a bit more but get better quality."
635,2,"If you want to go jogging or work out while listening to music, these headphones will stick in your ears like an earplug, staying put until you explicitly try to remove them. Since they block out sound well and stick close to your eardrum, they can produce very powerful and clear sound despite their size. They hide pretty well. Their foam piece is cheap online and easy to replace, which is important because they will wear out with all the squishing to make them fit in your ears. Best of all, they are cheap.Please keep in mind, though, that they pretty much function as earplugs. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. If you go jogging and fail to look both ways at roads, you may not notice a car approaching. However, if you want to be alone with your music and your thoughts (such as if you are ADD) then will serve you well."
636,1,"I've tried every position possible to make this thing work. If the wind blows, the sensor picks up the limbs blowing on our neighbors yard and it sets the beeper off. I've changed positions from the front of the garage to the side of the house. My objective was to be forewarned when someone pulled in our drive. I've finally found just the right spot, but not every time when there is movement does it work. You can walk right in front of it and it won't set off the beeper.  BE alerted, that this beeper unit can also be plugged into the wall............HOWEVER that is NOT supplied and you have to purchase the AC adapter. It's all plastic and you don't have a fortune in the thing, so it's not going to respond like an more expensive unit."
637,2,"I have two identical camcorders, and needed tripods for both.  This is my second Velbon VideoMate 607 tripod.  The first one worked so well that I decided to buy a second one of the same make and model.  The fluid head works very smoothly.  My pans look very professional.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it is not as steady when the column is elevated.  Other than that it is a very good value."
638,2,"I needed a remote switch to control my t2i and this one has what i needed,  the bulb to hold the shutter open and shutter button is nice to use when taking those shots you don't want any vibration."
639,0,"Bought one.Returned - unacceptable (many missed keystrokes)Bought a second one.Returned - unacceptable (top row of keyboard goes dead intermittently)Tried a third one in a bricks-and-mortar store.Did not buy - unacceptable (many missed keystrokes)The weird thing is, I bought one about three years ago and it was great. I used it until I wore it out.  I could touch type at top speed with it. But I guess there is no suitable replacement- - I've had to go to a hard plastic keyboard instead.  My point here is that it's not like I need to ""learn how to use the device"" or ""there is a hardware incompatibility"". The old one worked. Three new ones failed.Oh. Yeah. The mfr bitterly reports that CompUSA ripped off his idea and built their own. Maybe they did a better job . . ."
640,2,"This is a great MP3-CD Player.  In term of sound quality, it is good.  When I listen to my MP3s, I notice that piano and guitar harmonics sounds are kind of distorted.  Even though I can't tell if it is MP3's encoding problem or the unit's decoding problem, I will say it is MP3's encoding problem because of the way encoders work.  Just remember one thing: MP3 player consist of at least 2 important pieces: MP3 decoder which transform MP3 bytestream into waveform, and the D/A convertor which transform waveform into analog signal that we can hear.  The MP3 decoder is pretty much 'standard', but the D/A convertor is not.  That's where you should look at in term of playback quality, and it is also why I won't buy a shady-brand alternative.  Unit does not support ID tags, but it is not a problem to me since I just put inside a drawer in my car.  One bad thing in my set up is that I can't do song searching etc. while driving, but perhaps a remote like a standard CD-Player one would help... which is lacking here.  I think the MP3 organization on CD can be done with this way (and that's what I do) -- write a README.TXT in each dir that tells you what the heck is in the dir.  Name your sub-dir and songs like ALBUM000, 01.mp3 etc. and it should be fine."
641,2,"I've been using these headphones for over a year now and they're simply excellent.I know some have an issue with the style, but all I really care about is the sound quality.It's terrific."
642,0,"I had high hopes of sharing my Canon i850 printer, and the Hawking H-PS1U seemed to be the USB answer. Alas performance did not measure up to its looks. One, it was very, very slow. Two, it would not allow full bi-directional communication back to the computer. Three, it operated very hot. Did I say it was slow?One email contact to tech support containing four questions brought no response. Another finally brought a minimal answer - disable bi-directional capability. No, I said, I need that capability, and if a user has to disable a feature he/she paid for to use your device, your product is deficient. A third email returned one more answer - the server meets thermal targets. A fourth and final email generated the most comprehensive answer, repeating earlier instructions but still not addressing all my questions.So, if it does what you need, the Hawking is fine. If it doesn't, don't count on tech support for much help."
643,0,Mic not good. Many on the calls could not hear my voice clearly. Finally bought another headphone.Not using this anymore.
644,0,"I own this camera and while it was very good in 2002-2003 the years have passed it by.  There are other cameras with more megapixels, faster response time, better battery life, lighter weight, better lens, etc.  Plus they cost the same or less than this camera is advertised for here.  I still use it because I bought the waterproof case (up to 100ft depth!) and I use that regularly.  You can probably find used s230s for way less than the prices here if you really want it."
645,1,"I was in a bit of a hurry to get some cable locally and picked up a spool of this despite it's expense. It's not even oxygen free. Anyway, the clear casing may be kinda cool to look at, but it's difficult to work with, both in cutting, and when pulling. As far as audio quality, I can't tell any difference between this and the ""lamp cord"" I had been using before. Next time I'll go with some solid core stuff."
646,2,"Out of the box these sounded a little odd, but after letting them burn in over night the sound is very smooth. The bass was ok I thought, until a really heavy bass note hit and these things showed a little more power, and much deeper bass. The build could of been better, but for a pair of on ear headphones I wasn't expecting the heaviest build, these are about just as durable as most sets of on ear. However these come with a life time warrenty. These do start to hurt my ears eventually, I keep the comfort setting to light, so I can get more hours out of these in comfort. I can say I have a set over over ear headphones which sound better then these, but also cost 4 times as much. For walking around, on the go, these are great, they sound good, light weight, but dorky looking. None the less i am a college nerd, so I guess it works out for me."
647,0,"I'm a professional photographer making the transition from film to digital. I work in the studio and have always used moonlight flashes to light my subjects. I was looking to trigger the lights with my digital camera. It was difficult getting information on using flash units with my Nikon camera and even the Nikon manual and other books didn't even address the issue, a enormous oversight. Finally I was led to this device but finally after buying it, I discovered you can't use it with monolights, only Nikon flash units. Usin it with monolights risks burning out the electrical system of the camera. I ended up investing in continuous Tungsten lights for use with the camera."
648,2,Our boy bought the Garmin 010-00630-00 to keep from getting lost while using the QD2GWP  metal detector. I'm thinking this is not the end of it.
649,2,"The pros -  they give you plenty of material. I only used one link of it and have 2 left over. Also, the little elbows that come with it would make it easy to go around corners.The cons -  I wish the links would have been a little shorter. The instructions say you can cut them - perhaps for a man with tools that would work - but I definitely did not have anything I could have used to make the link shorter."
650,2,So far so good!  Perfect volume control!  I highly recommend it!
651,2,"I have two smaller Tamrac Digital series bags, and have been very pleased with the construction, looks, and convenience of them.  I am likewise impressed with the Tamrac 5696 Digital 6 bag.Unfortunately, despite Amazon's description that this is ""built for larger digital cameras and smaller digital camcorders,"" I will have to return the bag as it is too small to fit my Panasonic camcorder and accessories.  The camcorder itself (Panasonic HDC-TM700K Hi-Def Camcorder) fits OK, but there really isn't enough room left over to hold the AC battery charger plus cord, a component video and/or HDMI cable, extra battery, and camcorder remote.  I ended up getting aLowepro Camera/Camcorder Bag (EX-140)at a local store which is about 1"" taller and 1"" wider and has enough extra room to carry the TM700K plus accessories comfortably.  (Amazon'sLowepro Adventura 140 Camera Caseappears to have dimensions similar to the EX-140.)So just a suggestion to consider not just the camera or camcorder you'll be carrying but also the accessories you need to bring.  If it all fits in the 5696 then this bag is a solid choice."
652,1,However I found it difficult to appreciate the coding. One lead has a white marking on the insulation but it's just a faint stripe on one side. If that's OK with you then this is suitable for setups not requiring 12 gauge or where 12 gauge might be too bulky.
653,2,"I purchased the RC-1 remote to use with my Canon 400D XTI. This is a no-frills, easy to use wireless remote that is small and very light. It can even attach to your camera strap so its on hand wherever you are. There are 2 shutter settings you can choose, no delay and 2 second delay and the remote will easily work up to a 15 foot distance.My only gripe is (like alot of others have mentioned) is that the remote doesn't work from the rear of the camera which would be handy when doing portrait shots and trying to prevent camera shake. If not for this, I would have no hesitation to give it 5 stars."
654,1,it was nothing special but was just as advertised.  i'd spend a little more next time and get a better one.
655,0,"Got this router 2 months back. Was very happy to see the design of the router and mis-understood that it will even perform to the same level. First time I insert the configuration CD into my laptop, BOOM!! my wireless network went for a toss!!! Thankfully, my laptop has 'restore' functionality which allowed me to restore the settings prior to the netgear installation. I'm saved.It worked so-so for about a month. After that, everytime i want to connect to the net, I have to shutdown my laptop for atleast 10 minutes and then start it again. After repeating this for 3-4 times, 'it might connect'!! Feels pathetic. I would prefer a dial-up connection over this router.I'm giving one star, since i'm able to connect to the internet atleast few times a day!!"
656,0,"iQue = PDA + GPS, which is a versatile, capable tool... when it is working.  I have found the PDA/GPS combination to be fantastic.  Garmin's approach to the iQue 3600's extreme sensitivity to static electricity, however, has been very poor.  I have gone through 4 units since receiving this device as a gift.  Exchanges with Garmin have been no-questions-asked, but it is a hassle, and I end up paying shipping one way each time, plus there is the hassle of re-installing via Garmin's draconian serial number system.Overall, I like this product, but if there is any chance that your unit may face one elctron of static electricity, consider carefully before buying this item."
657,2,"Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones are indeed best bang for your bucks!This product still after many years still on the market tells you that people are still buying them for their reliability and excellent sound quality.PROS:[+] Best Sound for the money, well balanced bass, mids and highs[+] Good construction and comfort[+] Small enough to be tucked away[+] Very good sound isolation and can be used in high noise environmentsCONS:[-] No con really but if you feel uncomfortable you can always modify the unit with other in-ear foams just use Google as your best friendNote:The new generation of KOSS Plug has slightly more hiss when you have very silent music the signal to noise ratio comes into play when there is improper impedance matching, I think it is due to the fact that they are now 16 ohms versus 32 ohms earlier? Correct me if I wrong.This was my ""Father's day"" gift from my daughter, my earlier KOSS Plug earphones which I purchased 7 years back (which still works) had very disgusting foam material due to daily use and abuse which my daughter could not tolerate, Seeing me squeezing that dirty foam into my ears made her buy me a new set of earphones! The new foam materials are better and hope this will last a decade just as the other.Buy with confidence these are excellent earphones!"
658,1,The GPS fits well into this case but it lacks protective padding. It most likely would not protect your GPS if you were to drop it. There are many after market cases that would do a much better job of protecting your investment.
659,2,"It's a very usefull divice, but It don't have a focus function, and only two shoot settings, direct shoot and 2 seconds delay."
660,2,I am very fussy about my music and the headphones that deliver that music must be good.  The sound from these headphones is  crisp and clean.  I sometimes feel like I am in the recording studio because I can hear every little nuance.  The bass is present but not overwhelming.  They are VERY comfortable to have on over long periods of time.  They cover the ear but don't keep you from hearing what's going on around you.  I don't like earbuds but didn't want huge headphones either.  These are just right in size.  They are adjustable both in length and in pressure against the ears.  They fold up for travel.  I have bought other headphones and keep coming back to these as my favorite.  I think the price is incredible for the quality.  I highly recommend them.
661,2,"I just bought a new Specialized road bike with standard handle bars, and this mount did not fit. I know I should have read the tech details (fits handlebars up to 1 inch) and then measured my bike, but I figured it would fit a standard bike.Any advice?"
662,0,"This product is cheaper but in my experience dont work with good signal, sometimes my laptops loose the signal in small space, maybe are designed to work in very small distance. But i use it in my home and dont work like i wish"
663,2,This is a well made bag which can carry most all of your camera needs.  I found it works well to carry on my camera on airplane trips.  I can pack 3 lenses and a slr camera body.  Room for accessories and a way to strap on a small tripod makes this a good bag for hiking.Well worth the cost for the value.
664,2,"It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head)."
665,1,"I wish they came with a mic to answer calls, because the sound is great. I guess I'll only use them for my ipod vs. my iphone"
666,0,"I am one of those people who cannot wear earbuds.  My left ear opening is apparently too big to hold one in, and my right ear barely gets by.  I bought these hoping I could wear them while jogging.  However, the hook over the ear is too loose, and gravity is not enough to hold them on, and I swear I do not have a bouncy stride.  I can wear them around the house, but that's it."
667,2,"This is as short as it can be:THUMBS UP:- Turn On/Off in 3 sec (very good).- Turn On LCD in 1 sec, turn Off in a split second.- 2x Zoom is not bad at all (1.5 sec from W to T and vice versa)Equal to 38-76mm.- TV Out is really convenient for presentation. I used this whenI took almost 80 pics after a farewell party and everybody justloved it.- Tons of options to enhance your pics (add a border, exposureadjustment, white balance)- Internal memory that allows me to take 3 rapid shots. Betterthan nothing.- Battery is OK, not great though. I took around 120 pics withLCD + connect to TV for presentation and the battery stillalive (in a very critical condition).- With full battery, you can turn on LCD for a little more than10 mins.THUMBS DOWN:- Zoom is a little noisy.- LCD is more pixelate and has a slow refresh rate (around 15fps)- Software is really bad!!! Doesn't work with my comp (Celeron1.1Ghz, W2K, 768RAM). I used a CF reader.Summary:I don't have to read the manual to use it. Get an NIMH battery, and you are set to go. Very good if you can get it around $200."
668,0,The circuit breaker tripped after a few months.  I tried the re-set - no go. It was irreparably burned out.
669,2,"OMG! these are incredible!I never thought I would get sound this good from such a small pair of headphones!The bass is unbelievable! They have the puchiness and crisp sound I want! You can hear and feel drum beats as if you were right there with the band!The treble is also quite good, you can hear everything. the voices  are smooth and not high pitched, everything is balanced pretty well. But I feel the treble could be a touch higher.I don't know if the bass is intentionally enhanced, but it sounds a lot louder on these then any other headphones I have. But I like it, certainly makes my music sound more alive and in your face.Also worth noting, these have a nice soundstage, or stage presence if you will. Mostly because they don't cover around your ears.It would be great if Koss made a version of these in an over the ear Circumaural design. It would be nice to hear how it sounded.For a small portable headphone where sound isolation is not required, these are my babies.Here is what I own as of this review, to show you to what Im comparing from.Onkyo TX-SR500 recieverKoss UR29Koss the plugPanasonic RP-HJE50Koss Porta pro (of course)Audio-technica ATH-PRO5V"
670,1,"I just got an Onkyo and Klipsh 5.1 speaker system. 18 gadge works just fine, but I ordered the 16 gadge just now becasue there is just so much power to push; I don't want to choke it with my tiny 18ga. wire.: )"
671,0,"I bought a Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad to cool down my laptop, in an effort to extend the life of the system. Almost from the beginning it was problematic and represents one of the worst purchases I have ever made when it comes to computer equipment.When it was brand new it worked pretty well, but it did not last. After a couple of weeks it started to get louder and louder and finally one of the fans decided to quit working. I disassembled the Chill Pad and oiled the fan&#8217;s spindle, and that helped it for a couple of weeks before it did it again. So, to keep the thing working I had to take it apart every couple of weeks and oil the fans. This was a nuisance but was not really a big deal as I have been through this kind of effort with other fans in the past.Then it began to just cut off and on intermittently. I traced it back to a short in the switch. By keeping some tension on the cord I was able to keep it running.Finally, this evening it was making loud noises again and all at once it made a loud pop and cut off completely. It had self-destructed - the fans finally developed some wobble and the blades hit the enclosure, snapping some of the blades. So, I don&#8217;t believe I even got 6 months of total runtime out of this thing and it&#8217;s in the trash.Targus usually makes good stuff, but this particular Chill Pad is absolute junk. I cannot recommend this solution under any circumstances."
672,2,"These wire hiders are great and the adhesive is awesome... Maybe too awesome. I had to make some minor adjustments after the first install and not only did I pull off paint, but also a couple layers of drywall. This really isn't a bad thing, you want them to stick to the surface and do it well, I just want to make sure I call it our for fellow renters. I was able to run 4 wires approximately 50 feet, a sub woofer cable, ethernet, and x2 sets of speaker wire. It was a super tight fit, but I made it work. Be sure to run the wires before you stick to the wall as closing the seal is much more difficult once applied to the surface."
673,2,"Yes, way too expensive for what it is, but it's not made by anyone else and it DOES allow much more flexible usage of your flash unit.yes..Canon should have used metal foot given it's price.. add-on foot does the job.I also feel they could have used a bit more flexible cord as when you need to use full length like in your free hand, it wants to pull back too much.Rather than use just the replacement metal foot, I attached a metal flex joint type foot that allows even more adjustment.What are you going to do ?  You really need it and only Canon sells it..6/03/2008 update;New improved OC-E3 version out now... even higher price to match.Also a couple of clones added to the market, not sure of their quality.Jan 2010 update;Item is still working fine and has no broken parts."
674,1,"So I was very happy with my purchase initially. For the money, you can't beat the sound quality and comfort. So why only 3 stars? After regular use at the office, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, after approx 4 months of ownership, I noticed the left ear started to cut in and out at random. I realized I could shake or maneuver the cord and the sound would come in clear without going out.Sadly, as I write this, the left ear cup has completely gone out and won't play anymore. I assume the wiring came loose.So now I'm forced to toss these.I've gone ahead and purchased my first pair of noise cancellation headphones, the Audio Technica anc7's. Here's to hoping the build of those last longer than the 4 month lifespan of these."
675,2,"These are a bit awkward to put on at first but I assume you get used to that. From the moment you have them on, listen to music and think you are using a $350 pair of headphones. The sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price. I just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review - they are that good. They do leak a bit of sound so I would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral (the look may also be a bit of a giveaway) but other than that - they are simply unbelievable. Highly recommended. As far as the comparison to the PX100 - my wife has those (these were a replacement for my pair that I gave someone as a present) and the sound quality of the Koss is far better."
676,0,"I have wasted hours on this device trying to use it.  After about 45 minutes of rebooting and driver installation/reinstallation, I can usually get it to work for a little while before one of WIDCOMM driver programs crashes.  Once a program crashes, it requires another 45 minutes of work.  Avoid this device for any Windows use."
677,2,"I tried the expensive active noise cancelling thing in stores (including Bose) and have always been disapoited that it should be more like ""Noise dampening"" but definitively not ""Cancelling""...same thing with this...you hear the outside world as you do when you use ear plugs (i.e. the noise is lowered) but when you play the music, particularly if you like to play it somewhat loud, then you can't really hear anything from outside!  For $10 I take that over the $300+ stuff any day!!  The bass is a bit strong for my taste, but I can adjust that on my MP3 player... I must warn you though, I'm not a audio file... I like a good sound, but that's about it...so if you try headphones like some people taste wines...then forget about my review...but if you want something that blocks the outside noise enough (I couldn't hear my loan mower while the music was playing, at all!!) while you listen to your music and don't want to spend a fortune, these things are great!! I'll be buying another set as soon as these die for sure!"
678,0,"I like Sennheiser products. A lot. My favorite being the HD280. I also have the Sony MDR V6 and Grado SR60i.I thought these Sennheiser PX200 would be really good - but what the pictures don't do is give you an idea of how small, flimsy, and cheap they feel. The label should say ""Fisher Price"".Anyways, these were supposed to be a gift. I returned it and ordered a pair of Sony MDR V6 instead for approximately the same price.I'm very disappointed in these headphones."
679,1,"The pda worked fine, in fact, as perfect as it comes for the basic operations. The memory stick is great, especially if you have other Sony equipment that uses it. However, after two months of use it all of a suddent went dead. The usual tricks like resetting, etc. failed to revive it, and Sony technician had me send it for service, express mail and all paid by the warranty. 10 days later, they are still &quot;working on it&quot;, and the web page says that they can hold it for 15 working days, i.e. 21 days! Imagine being without your phone book and pocket calendar for 3 weeks! This is totally unacceptable. I wonder if other manufacturers are any better. The only soluiton I can imagine is the &quot;Jaguar&quot; method: buy two. Not very funny, is it?"
680,1,"The cable isn't solid, it's a lot of little wires and you have to twist the end.  I'm sure a lot of people already knew this but this is my first time buying speaker wire."
681,2,Works as advertised. The lock can seem a bit finicky until you learn how to lock it right. It works great.
682,2,"...this is a great camera for the beginner, someone new to digital cameras or an ""average"" user of cameras in general. even for a 2.1MP camera, it takes great shots. granted, i have nothing to compare it to! uploading photos is easy on winXP, but i couldn't do it on win98; i had to buy a flash card reader.PROS: affordable (now, anyway!), easy user interface, with a 64mb flashcard, you can take 103 high quality photos. 3X optical zoom is nice.CONS: heavy. image viewer is kinda hard to see; images are fuzzy. 2X digital zoom is useless. sucks batteries like crazy. get rechargables."
683,2,"It was my first plunge into the MP3 world and I felt that the key would be choosing the right headphones.  Following a good deal of research I believe I made the right choice.These Koss PortaPro's are lightweight with an excellent sound, and the unique design makes them very comfortable.  I have tried the Bose $220 headsets - and if you fly alot they're probably worth it for the sound dampening  effect - but if someone makes a better sounding set for less than twice as much - buy it.  For $35 these are well worth the money.U P D A T E: Purchased in January 2008, I've been using these for 4 years now and have been through 3 or 4 sets of earpiece covers. They still sound great!  [One time I thought the bass had gone out on one side as it had an awful rattle, but I cleaned it out - it was a hair against a speaker - and it sounded fine again.  So check for debris before you toss yours out.]"
684,1,"I have a big floor and bookshelf  speakers 5.1 home theater system, now it was in a smaller room and in the new room the  orignal cable was a bit short and visible so I wanted to replace the cable that it will look cleaner so I bought this, I rewired the whole system and it looked great,I ran out of wire exactly for the left surround,so I said I will buy another one but first I tested the sound and it was bad,the center sounded extremely muffled and the detail was lacking ,I read that for a short distance its better to go with thicker wire, my old ones are about 10 guage for the front mains and center and 18 guage for surrounds, now in the center channel I heard a lot of the quiet detail and the voices sounded real and natural with the old cable , for example: the fifth element when it goes from the music to when he calculates how time there is until evil arrives and he likes whispers numbers and when there is s in something somebody says and the mid woofers blend in very well with tweeter, with this cable all that detail was completely gone,on the fronts it made them tinny and the treble was very very low and the was a echo, I ended up returning the old ones for the fronts and center and I used this only for the 2 surrounds at the end, the surrounds sound fine, my suggestion is buy this only if you have one of those home theater in a box packages with small speakers,you should replace that string thin cable because with small speakers this would make a good difference, I specificly wanted to try the rca wire but I won't make that mistake again,next time Im going to buy speaker cables its from a hardware store like lowes or home depot.."
685,2,This switch is just what I needed for long exposures and low light photographs using a tripod.  I like he fact that you can stand  behind the camera and take the photograph.  This easy and simple to use.
686,2,its all right for the price but like the flexi ties cable wrap better than this. this isnt that neat a purchase. it works and does the job but doesnt keep em together all the time.
687,0,"nicely designed, good sound, comfortable, very reasonable price. just what i was looking for. However, the point at which the wire enters the 3.5 mm plug head, repeated bending with seemingly inadequate support led to the early failure of this otherwise good headset."
688,2,"The biggest thing about this telescope is its size, not how big it is but how SMALL it is. Small means easy to carry, and that means you'll be more motivated to take it out and look at things. More importantly you will take it to good 'dark sky' locations. Even with the Meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand, that and a simple set up make it fun to use. The Super Plossil Zoom eyepiece is a great accessory, and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look at."
689,1,"For the price you pay, you get veiled highs and mids, with muddy lows. Articulation is poor, and the soundstage is narrow. Overall, I'd spend money on ear buds before these. Pass...If you want a great value, look at the JVC HA-RX900. Very nice for the money."
690,0,"Titanium means very light weight. These are light. Sound is OK, but you have to press them against your ears to get full sound. Also, I am not bald, so the phones keep slipping off my head. I use them for my iPod. It's a good thing I'm sitting instead of jogging. I suppose for the price, they are ok, but I'd rather spend a few dollars more and get a heavier headset. (I did buy a more expensive pair.)"
691,2,"I've been wearing these daily for about 4 months now, and am extraordinarily pleased with them for the price. Yes, there is a caveat- I paid $40 for these, and for *that price* they have fit and/or surpassed all of my expectations. I believe these can compete with any headphones in the &lt;$100 range. I do have two complaints, though.Audio: 4/5. Bass is powerful, highs are clear, mids are crisp enough. Perhaps a little too well blended for rock (not much emphasis on treble), but fantastic for acoustic/instrumental pieces and hip hop.I dock 1 star because of the utter lack of sound isolation. Having on-ear pads with no noise cancellation tech really means NO noise cancelling (duh). This is fine, but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you. The pads also bleed sound easily- I had to be mindful even playing at half volume in public.Aesthetic: 5/5. As authentically retro as you can get, since they are literally from the 80's.Build quality: 5/5. Simplicity makes for durability in this case.-1 for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear. Fortunately, you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears, shifting the pressure up to the side of your head. The springy metal band will allow these to fit any head size. +1 for the 90 degree input jack. Straight jacks get bent out of shape too easily; this design won't suffer the fate of many a pair of iPod earbuds.For the price, there is no superior. That much I will assert strongly. If you want audiophile headphones and have over 100 to spend, or want noise cancellation (take the metro to school/work? you won't want to use these.) then I advise looking elsewhere. If you are on a budget and want simple quality without the bells and whistles, these are perfectly suited for you and you will enjoy uncompromising sound quality."
692,2,"I just got these today and so far they are exactly what I wanted. I have read some reviews about the sound quality being bad when you turn it down low. Honestly, if your turning your music down that low then your obviously tyring to pay attention to other things. I tried my headphones with the controller on and off and i don't hear a difference. It is a delicate thing. Very light. My ONLY complaint is that I wish the volume control wheel was a little longer but it is something I can easily deal with. I will update in a few months or if something happens."
693,1,"I bought this because I did not want to dedicate one of my lab machines to print services.  This was one of the most challenging device setup I have ever experienced.  All of my networking equipment is LinkSys (LinkSys 4 Port WAP, LinkSys PC Card, LinkSys PCI card etc.)I eventually gave up an called tech support and was able to get one machine printing.  After much trial and error I was able to get all my Windows XP and Linux machines to successfully use the device.However, I find I must reset the device (unplug power cord, wait 10 seconds, plug back in) each day.  For some reason, even with a static IP, the device hangs and I get print errors.I gave up in disgust and bought a Netgear print server that was both easy to setup and works flawlessly."
694,2,"This is a bag for professionals!!people, this can easily fit 2 lenses, a slr body, battery charger, 2-3 cords, a few filters,even the manual and still have room for more :) and the padding aint that bad either..the build-quality is excellent and overall I would definitely recommend it if u really intend to carry a lot of stuff or else go for something smaller.Overall,a great product."
695,2,"This device has proved very useful in taking my eTrex along for bike rides. It fits nicely on small diameter handlebars (not so well on expensive mountain bike handlebars which have a larger diameter, but that's why Garmin makes a larger mount). It doesn't slip when riding over rough terrain, and it holds the GPSr securely. If you have an eTrex with a memory card, you will have to use the bracket that came with your eTrex, the one-piece back that comes with this bracket won't fit. If that's the case, you will need to check the tightness of the screw fairly often.All in all, a nice product."
696,1,"I had higher expectations on these ones. Not very good at noise cancelling.. Does not have that intense bass i was looking for..I guess they are good for what i payed, i should have gotten the skullcandy with bass thingy..Pros:Good cable length."
697,2,"Suits my needs almost perfectly.  A great balance of quality construction, design, price and sound.  All that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation.  I love these headphones."
698,0,"Sort of works, if you are lucky, but its slow and unreliable. However it constantly drops offline and the driver software is garbage. In my opinion this was a waste of money and time. Don't bother with this for the less technologically inclined, they will just be confused as to why it isn't working and the steps to return it to functionality are cumbersome."
699,2,"My SONY A100 camera with 70-210mm lens fit into this bag easily.  This camera bag is smaller enough so you can carry another bag with additional lens together.  I do not want people look at me as News person, so the plain look is OK for me."
700,2,"Many people are complaining here about damaged tapes.  I have used these tapes for years and have never had a problem.  HOWEVER, I don't ever buy tapes online, only in a store.  I fear that tapes will get wrecked during shipment so I prefer to get them at a store.  The tapes are good when you get a good batch.  I have tapes that I recorded years ago (some as far back as 2004 and even earlier), and they still play almost perfectly now.  It's a little more pricey to get them in a store versus on the internet but you will have a better chance of getting good tapes, so it's worth it."
701,0,"I ordered this knowing full well that Celestron lenses weren't the greatest in the world, but this was still a little disappointing.  When using these lenses in my telescope, all of the images were quite blurry, no matter which lens I used.  The filters were less than impressive as well.  My yellow filter arrived with a very noticeable scratch through the middle that makes it nearly worthless for using with the telescope.  Also, the foam insert for my case does not match the one in the description and did not include space to store my own lenses and that was one of the factors for me that lead to my decision to buy this.  Buyer beware, this looks like a great deal up front, but the quality of these lenses and filters is quite sub par."
702,0,"Tuesday afternoon, I got my 50mm lens.  I took some wonderful portrait pictures with it.  I loved it.  I preferred it over my other 55-250mm and 18-55 mm lenses.  But, my happiness didn't last for long. By Thursday night, something went wrong with the lens.  It was strangely acting.  It was making noise when it was attached to my T3i camera.  The shutter inside the lens kept on opening and closing.  I had to return this lens.  But, I will order another."
703,0,"I bought 3 of these for the kitchen and bathroom.One of the outlets died after 3 weeks. The unit normally has a green light and the light went out. Could not get any power through the outlets. No reset button. Only good news is it's less than 30 days so I could ship it back to Amazon for a refund.I have a dozen of surge protectors, some of which have lasted for years. This is the first time I have had a surge protector croak on me. I bought this for the price and the Belkin brand and expect better reliability.Edit: Now one of the other protectors has also died after 2-3 months of use. Unit no longer lights up or provides power and I'm outside of the 30 day return window. Manufacturer warranty is meaningless when the shipping cost is as much as the price of a new one. Piece of junk.Edit 2: After looking at other wall surge protectors nearly all of them are made so they become useless as soon as it trips. Unlike larger surge protectors where you can reset them with a push of a button these smaller protectors only work once. I would not use this for hair dryers, portable heaters, or other high wattage items. You are better off buying a wall tap."
704,0,"I bought it for the Slik monopod I got and it works smoothly, quickly and securely.  I just used it on a subject in which the light passing through some blinds was creating a great pattern on a large indoor plant leaf.  I needed the monopod quickly and the light was fleeting, and I already had the quick connect pad attached to my camera so I was able to get it almost immediately.  It's a bargain for what it does and makes one wonder why all monopods don't come with them.UPDATE:  the plastic top for the quick connect pad has partially peeled off. Also, it does need to be attached with a flat head screwdriver. I wish it were the same size and material as another quick connect I have with a tripod that is rubberized and has held up for decades.  This does work but there's no reassuring feeling of security with it while having a heavy camera and lens attached to it.  I'm no longer using it and am simply screwing the Slik monopod into the tripod hole."
705,1,"I really would like to have kept this mouse because it fits my hand so well.  But since I do alot of Photoshop, I was annoyed by the fact that the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wake it up.  I also agree with the other reviews that you couldn't get the mouse to behave the same way as a ""wired"" mouse would for precision (but since this is my first ""wireless"" I have had no other exp).If you are looking for a mouse that is comfortable, this is a good candidate.  It's nice when I do system admin or program, but once I start designing then :("
706,0,"After reading several reviews, I had high hopes for these. What none of the reviews mention, or could even discuss, is that the wires on these headphones are extremely flimsy. The headphones lasted through about eight airplanes flights and then stopped working. The problem was clearly in the wiring, which is very thin and fragile. Some people have complained about the lack of bass, which is true, but if you are mainly using them to watch movies on the plane (which is what I used them for) this is actually preferable to a strong bass signal, which can muddy up dialog. When they worked, I liked these headphone, but I expect things that cost more than $20 to last longer than eight uses. I cannot recommend these.Pros: Comfortable for long trips. Good noise canceling. Still work when power is off (unlike Bose). Relatively inexpensive.Cons: Flimsy wiring. Boosts airplane audio signal so that sometimes even the lowest volume is slightly too loud. Wiring configuration can lead to tangles."
707,0,"I have an older Terk LeapFrog at one house and wanted to install something similar at our vacation home.  The older model doesn't appear to be available anymore so I figured this product would work as well (since it's made by the same company), if not better (since it's newer).  I figured wrong.  The old LeapFrog works immediately and everytime; the emitter doesn't even need to point at the product it's controlling, just being in the same enclosed cabinet is enough.  On this newer product I can't seem to get it to work reliably unless I hold the remote 24"" from the receiver.  Oddly enough, after continuing to ""bombard"" the receiver with IR radiation from the remote it sort of ""wakes up"", and starts working, until you don't use the remote for a while and then it's back to square one.  The vacation home is in a remote area and the only other wireless devices in the house are a 5.8GHz cordless phone, and a 802.11g router on another floor in the opposite corner of the house.  I have the same wireless devices at the ""older LeapFrog home"" and the same 802.11g router sits next to it.  The receiver and emitter in the ""newer LeapFrog home"" are about 3 linear feet from each other.  I'm baffled that Terk could take a simple product that worked great 4 years ago, and through the marvel of engineering incompetence, make it worse."
708,2,"It is a great item for hiding unsightly wires, but not more than 3 wires in one lines or it won't close. Use a roller brush to paint them and wish that there were more end units."
709,0,"the camera works OK.  The wrist strap is impossible to put on.  I need it since many users need this on the go and it would save the camera from dropping.The wrist strap was so frustrating, that we wanted to throw it out the window.There is also no case.Can't really recommend it since it gave us so much initial frustrations."
710,0,"This was a total rip off. I was excited when opening the package, in order tu plug it and start moving all around he screen; Instead, the hardware recognized the mouse but it would not work until ten minutes had passed afetr pluging in.After that, the mouse seems to work only when it feels like working, and that is not very common. It freezes for many minutes with no response whatsoever. I am considering returning it for a full refund"
711,2,"It works great and looks wonderful, but with an HDMI cable and power cable it's a tight fit.Luckily that's all I have running to this TV, so this solution wouldn't work for my living room TV.Luckily there is a larger one, but I'd just hoped this one had a little more interior room.Another issue I found is the pieces to run it around corners are not the best. They didn't &#34;snap&#34; on like I thought they would, but that might have been from &#34;too many wires&#34; running."
712,1,"First product did not work out of the box.  Nothing.  Second unit worked, but item loosely rattling around inside.  Third unit worked, and no rattling that could potentially cause a short.  Had for a few weeks and still working ok."
713,0,"Even after reading the reviews in this forum I still bought one of these cards because the price was so good. I also thought that the problems were only with Palm products. They are not. I put the card into my RCA Lyra MP3 player, loaded songs onto the card, started playing one of those songs and the player shut down after about 40 seconds. After trying several songs and having the same result, I played songs from the internal memory and all worked fine. I tried this with many different songs and anytime I play a song that is stored on the card, the player just shuts itself off.BTW, this card was made in China.No matter how good the price is, heed the warnings in these reveiws and don't buy this card."
714,0,"I was very disappointed with this item, so much so that I sold it again and purchased another Kensington trackball."
715,2,I have a sole elliptical that has built in speakers and an input for 3.5mm stereo plug.  It does not however have a built in audio control.  Running straight from my Roku player to the elliptical was too loud and from the tv too low.  This works perfectly connecting my Roku player to the elliptical now that I can control the volume.
716,0,"I deleted my original, 5-star review. I know this particular model is no longer available, but if my experience is any indication, you should think hard before buying a Toshiba laptop, especially a lower-end model. I had the Satellite 1415-S173 for three years -- during the first year I had it, it blew a hard drive (thankfully under warranty). I had it fixed and less than a week later, it blew another hard drive. This time it went back to Toshiba to be fixed. All was more or less well for the next two years, when a Windows problem shut the thing down completely. I took my data out of it and switched back to a Mac. I am sick of Windows' unreliability, susceptibility to viruses and other problems, and the masking-tape-and-chewing-gum nature of patching together Windows machines just in order to make them function. BUT -- more to the point, the computer had inherent problems, first and foremost being the cheap desktop processor Toshiba uses (or used) in their lower-end laptops. This machine got incredibly hot and I was told this is probably what killed my first 2 hard drives. If you have one of these machines, I highly recommend a cooling platform which is probably the only thing that kept my laptop running for an additional 2 years. It's a shame, because aside from being very heavy and having a weak battery charge (1.5 hours at best), this laptop was attractive and easy to use with a nice bright display. But ultimately -- not a good value -- at $1,200 I don't consider it a ""cheap"" machine by any means, and certainly not when compared to my (less expensive) iBook."
717,1,I had to return the bag because I had the worst time opening it.  Otherwise it's nice looking and seems practical inside.  Why ruin it with that awful closure?
718,0,Ordered this for use with a PC but the plugin was wrong (meant for a standard phone jack).
719,0,"This router seemed to have everything for very little money.  Well, if it is too good to be true, it probably is.The setup was nice and smooth.  However, everything past that had problems.First, it kept dropping my wireless connections.  I called support and they told me to restart it.  It kept doing it.  I called back and waited on hold for them to tell me to change a bunch of funky settings (MTU, channel, etc.).  Why should that be necessary for basic operation?  Well, I did it and it helped.Next, I found that it was intermittently dropping packets, maybe 5% of the time.  After waiting on hold for 40 minutes, they told me to install new firmware.  It kept happening.  After another 40 minutes on hold, they told me they'd escalate my call.  I was disconnected.I call back.  After 1 hour on hold for a level 2 tech person, I talk to somebody who says he doesn't know and he'll transfer me to a level 2 tech.  Agg!!  I'm still on hold at this moment, after another 20 minutes on hold.  So far, I've spent over 4 hours just trying to get it to work reliably.I've used the Netgear in the past.  It is solid.  Linksys routers also tend to be more reliable than this.  (I work for an internet provider.  We've tested a few of these things.)  I strongly suggest anybody go with either of those, even if they cost a little more than the D-link."
720,2,"This is a nice little eye cup for the Canon camera series.  Only drawback is that it slides off relatively easy.Great price, good quality eye cup, just watch it for falling off..."
721,0,"These phones sound good for the price, but they are uncomfortable. I can't wear them for more than 30-60 minutes at a time as they pinch my ears. I expected more comfort from a Koss product, since Koss has provided me with a handful of good headphones over the years. I'm going to try and return them if I still can and spend a little more to get some more comfortable phones."
722,0,"All reviews for wireless products seem to run the gamut from great to terrible. I would like to provide my input, but your experience may differ.I purchased 3 of these in a row (over a week period). The first one I got working for a bout 2 weeks, then it started to drop the signal, causing me to have to power cycle the unit. I called Tech Support, and after about 30 minutes of troubleshooting, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. I did so, and the second unit would not connect to the internet, and after another 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. Having seen so many rave reviews of this product I assumed I was just having a run of bad luck and got another one of these. I had the exact same experience.I returned the Linksys unit and purchased a D-Link D-634M, and it worked within minutes of being out of the box. I have had no issues for the last 2 months.Not sure if the store I was going to had a bad batch or what."
723,2,"Product is of excellent built quality. It cannot house 3 lenses with DSLR camera body (in my opinion). I have Canon SL1 body, 18-55mm STM lens, 4 filters , extra battery, battery charger, SD card, cables, 1 prime lens placed inside this bag and in my opinion this bag cannot have any more camera body or zoom lens. However it is a well built, compact and durable product which is excellent for the price. Shipping and packing was excellent. Zips, pockets and padding is remarkable. Overall a very good product. Only the product description is misleading otherwise deserves 5 stars. Will recommend to those who don't want big bags or have less equipment (DSLR camera and lens)."
724,2,"I bought a pair for my family computer 5 years ago. Aside from replacing the ear pads once in the 5 years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use!  The independent reviews speak for themselves. Allow me to put it this way: Koss does not make many models of headphones,have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80's because of these headphones, and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984. With that said, these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are. Furthermore, companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the German car makers and American muscle. They have not changed, have the same accents, and characteristics because you don't fix things that are not broken.Sound Quality:I bought AKG Q460s and they were horrible for the price. I had to sell those nightmares off to buy these. It served me right for considering anything but Koss. After hearing such bad headphones I missed the PPs because I am currently away. I needed these to remind me of home. These sound very well balanced, have great bass, and crisp mids, and lighter treble. I think that bass heads will not like these, but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones. They do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air, but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable. The open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy. These are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids.Pros: Great sound and lifetime warranty.Cons: They are a little awkward because of the metal band, but you will get over it when you hear how good they are.If you are buying online and don't have the time to test them. Just buy these. It's a no brainer. These are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason. If reviews don't convince you - I don't know what will!"
725,2,"I have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years, yes they die but I use them during workouts, runs, etc. I would say I go through about 3/year and think they are well worth it. I also have the gold kdx models (two), sent them for repairs and the customer service was nice...thanks"
726,0,"This cable unfortunately doesn't seem to work with my RS-232 cable when I need to have direct connections to Cisco devices such as my offices Cisco ASA5505 Security Appliance.The software says it works for Windows 7, but It unfortunately will work when using 'Putty' for serial connections. I really wanted this cable to work because RS-232 is becoming outdated and most new laptops and PC's don't have RS-232 inputs anymore so its better to opt for serial (rs-232)to USB for compatibility purposes.I even tried it on my older Windows XP machine and it still would not become recognized. I've sense purchased an iogear Cisco Certified cable and have no complaints."
727,2,I use these things all the time and a big pack like these fit my needs perfectly. Good value for the money.
728,0,"Bad! Bad! Bad!What can I say, this thing did not work. I got maybe 1 or 2 signals to actually reached and functioned my component inside my cabinet.The design is like something a child would design for a 5-grade science project--and it would earn an Honorable Mention ribbon at best. Thin plastic casing. Light weight...the satellite receiver's (short) cable easily moves the transmitter out of position when you are trying to position the dumb things. And who uses a metal, external antennae any more...this is 2012, right. Enough said.Never said this before about a product: DO NOT BUY THIS THING!"
729,1,"Amazon three star rating = &#34;It's Okay&#34;  Works well enough.  Logitech SW and/or drivers not required for our function/use with Windows7.  Receives just three stars due to included documentation directing user to unnecessary Logitech SW which wasted 15 minutes of my time.  It is large so while it fits my hand, the wife and kids hate it.  Track ball is useful for limited desk space. No problems shipping or packaging."
730,0,"Just plain crapped out after 6mos. Always needed resetting even a few months ago, now just wont work. Replaced with netgears most basic 802.11g and it solved all my issues."
731,0,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this MP3-CD player.  I saw it in Circuit City and thought that it had a lot of features I liked, so I purchased it.  What a big mistake!Problems:o Skips on regular audio CDs (even when sitting still)o Skips and pops when playing MP3 fileso Jumps from one MP3 file to another IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FOLDER (?!!)o Fails to recognize folders (showed strange Japanese characters)o Fails to recognize some MP3 CDs AT ALL!I've only owned this player for a week.  How could I have encountered this many problems in such a short time?  I actually exchanged the player at the store today because I thought I had a defective unit.  From reading the rest of the reviews, I realize I have a defective product.Don't touch this player with a 10-foot pole.  I'm returning this player tomorrow and getting the iRiver SlimX iMP-350 CD/MP3 player instead."
732,1,"Bought the exact same model that I loved so much (my old HD-280s circa 2005 were taped up and falling apart). Then I hardly used these after buying the replacements because the &#34;new&#34; version of this model was so inferior. The sound is still good, but the comfort level was greatly reduced. The previous version of HD-280s had really soft earfoams and were enormously comfortable over hours of use. These feel tight and constricting. I don't know what they did, but I would have paid more to keep the prior quality. I'm guessing the new material was a cost issue. p.s. I still use these because the sound is good"
733,0,"I've only been into astronomy for 2 months now, but even for me this set is a bit too entry level quality wise. However I can see the value of this kit to some users because it does come with so many accessories that could be useful at a really inexpensive price.I already have two luminous eyepieces and opted to get this kit to round out my collection. However the image quality is very poor in comparison to what I already have so I opted not to keep this kit.The 32mm eyepiece did not show any signs that it was low quality, the image was good. However for the higher magnification pieces the image was never as clear as I wanted.The color filters are OK, definitely acceptable for the price.I really liked the case the most, it is well made and has room for other pieces you may have.The price point is very appealing for this product, but I believe the optics of the eyepieces may hold back your telescope from giving you the best image possible."
734,0,"I know it was my fault for not reading the product description carefully enough, but I completely missed the ""PS/2"" in the description and purchased it.  And, since I haven't had a computer with a PS/2 connection since days gone by, I had to return it.  What was most disappointing was that (even though the box suggested that the manufacturer also carried the same keyboard with a USB connection) I was unable to find it anywhere online.  It went back and I had to go back to my search for the perfect mini-keyboard. :-(  Finally bought the Microsoft Arc, and it'll do the trick, but I really preferred the size and shape of the returned keyboard in several ways.  If anyone knows of where I can purchase the same keyboard with a USB connection, please let me know.  Thanks!"
735,2,"For 2 years I owned a Palm III. It was great - organized my time, appts, schedules, phone numbers, contacts, etc.  A few months ago I got the Palm VII - for wireless access. So far, I have used the wireless Mapquest and other services, like email (virtually EVERY provider can be accessed through this)... so if you need wireless access get this. Otherwise, if you just need an organizer..just go for the Palm III"
736,0,This product is very flimsy. do not buy it!!!!! will not last for mroe than a few weeks unless you baby it.....
737,0,"I tried one of these for a long time and have to say that despite all of its ""features"" that supposedly make this product so much better, the iPod is still vastly superior.Personally, I find the Zen rather ugly, with a tiny blue-green screen and that idiotic ""mouse-style"" scrollwheel on the side. The front and back are nce and shiny, but overall, from external appearances, I was not impressed. Overall it just seems like a strange size and weight and it never quite fits anywhere.On to the actual point of owning one--playing music. In this, I can say that the Zen has nothing on the iPod. The search feature (typing a letter in one at a time by selecting it with the wheel); the organization system that just doesn't make sense, and the fact that you have to view everything on that little tiny screen--sure you can put 20 GB of music on it, but I dare you to find one song on that crappy little wheel in half the time it would take me on a 20 GB iPod!I do like that you can make playlists on the actual device, but the entire system suffers from far too much needless complexity. Everything is too complicated, too much ""relearning"". The sides are riddled with buttons, none of which have much tactile feedback, and trust me--if this is in your pocket, you won't have much idea which side is which without looking! On my iPod, I can change songs, raise and lower the volume, etc. without even thinking or looking at the device itself. It's just a simpler, more efficient way.I've given the Zen 2 stars for having a large drive, a decent appearance (certainly better than those horrible Archos hunks-of-junk), and high-speed connectivity. It is a technical masterpiece, with the ability to create playlists, change EAX settings, add reverb and speed changes to your music, and record... but all of this is utterly ruined by its stupid wheel, bad organizational system, poor screen, and needless complexity (if you select a song in the list, it begins playing but your screen does not change to indicate which song is playing--in fact, if you scroll for a while you will soon have NO CLUE what song you're playing, what song is next, etc. until you back all the way out of every menu and go to Now Playing. By contrast, the iPod switches to show the current song, and pressing menu lets you select another song, or back out the SIMPLE, THREE-LEVELS-DEEP MENU system to get back to Now Playing. The Zen's menu system is 5 to seven levels deep when it could be two or three!)I'm all for iPod competition, but the iPod is still the best. Get it instead--you won't regret it."
738,0,"When I decided to upgrade from my old Rio to a 20GB mp3 player, this is the first one I purchased.  Not because the reviews were so great, but because I'm a hardcore PC guy who has an aversion to anything Apple.  I had this thing for about two weeks before returning it to the store.  First the necessary cables weren't in the box, then the Zen didn't know how to talk to my Dell, I had to download some drivers and call customer support, finally it would only import 80% of my songs because the other ones had what the software called &quot;fatal bit errors&quot; even though they played fine on my computer.  And trust me, I work in IT and tech problems are my specialty.  I finally got the thing working, barely, but then I happened to mess around with my girlfriend's iPod (she has a Mac, of course).It took me about five minutes to realize the mistake I had made.  The iPod is better designed, with easier menus and what sounded (to my untrained ears) like better sound quality.  I asked Sara how long it took to get the thing working, and she looked at me with a blank face.  She said all she did was plug it in and boom -- thirty minutes later she was good to go.  I returned my Zen THAT DAY, picked up the 20GB iPod, and had my CD collection imported within the hour.  No bit errors.  No driver problems.  I kept thinking something must be wrong because I didn't need to do any troubleshooting.  The thing works perfect.  I don't care what your loyalties are, the iPod is the premier unit out there.  It costs a little more, but save yourself the headache and just get one."
739,0,"This Review is for the 4 port PA055U Targus USB Hub. Another lump of plastic for my junk box. Save your money and buy the connectland for half the price of this one. Mine was dead on arrival. I thought it was maybe the power supply ""seeing as it has a 5 volt external power port"". I went thru many places looking and finally used an old cell phone charger that had the same matchup config. Still didn't work for me. No blue lights no recognition at all when I plugged it in. Basically useless. If I hadn't taken it apart to look inside for power problems I would return it. But it looks pretty in my box with my other useless dead computer peripherals."
740,2,"This product is cheap and you get cheap pictures.  My wife and I used these cameras to take underwater pictures of sharks.  They came out a bit grainy, but you can still make out the shark details.  I was overall ok with the camera because you get what you pay for.  I was expecting high def pictures and I didn't get them."
741,2,"I bought this to control the volume of my Audio-Technica M50 headphones (which have no in-line volume control). The headphones are VERY loud when plugged directly into the computer when the system volume is any higher than 2%, so having a mechanical limiter like the VC20 is essential.So far I have no real complaints. Initially I was skeptical about the thin dial, but I've grown to like it - it's easy to find by feel in the dark, but difficult to bump accidentally.The plug end is a little skimpy, but since the control will live by my computer I'm not worried about durability.I can't give a scientific opinion about the sound quality - I'm sure there's some quality loss introduced by putting this device between the source and the headphones, but I'm unable to discern a difference. The sound coming from my M50's is still very nice!I wish it had a mute button, but for the price I can't complain. :-)"
742,2,The plugs feel like safety plugs and remove almost as much noise.When  I put these on I was able to reduce my volume level in half!I am now able to listen to my mp3 player while mowing the lawn.But the feel took a while to get used to.  Soft and spongy in my ear didn't feel right at first.Great value for the price.
743,0,I now have the model that is the next price up from panasonic and am very pleased. This model was not good. It is flimsy and I accidentally pushed it too hard and it cracked. I also did not like the fact that there was not volume control and the caller sounded extremely loud. Other than that its an ok piece. I do not recommend it and think you would be pleased as I am with the next higher model from panasonic.I hope this helps someone.
744,0,"Very disappointed with this lens from Canon, it has been released from 1998 and until now there is no improvement , the creep of the lens is not only annoying but also dangerous for its safety, not very comfortable for a walking lens, focus is slow, colors come out washed out and at 135 you  need a tripod for a sturdy  image. The good range is between 32-110mm, It looks great on Rebel T2i but that is not enough. I returned but i wanted to give it a second chance....i looked for a used one but all were with dust inside and dented lenses, &#921; had the chance to compare it with the 18-200mm and i can say there is a big difference between those two lenses. I preferred to keep the 18-200 and I will recommend you keep your money for a better lens."
745,2,"I often buy headphones with built-in volume control.  But the brand and style I really like is no longer available.  I discovered this in-line volume control, realized it would work with any standard headphones using a 1/8 inch plug and I couldn't be happier.  If I need extra cord length for my phones, this gives it.  And I will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one.  It's just so much quicker and easier to deal with."
746,0,"The camera-end connector on this cable does not fit any of our cameras (Kodak CX7430, etc).  It is rectangular, not the trapezoidal shape needed by our cameras. The merchant was very nice, however, and immediately offered a full refund."
747,1,"You get what you pay for.  I usually take good care of my electronic equipment,with that being said, I fear these headphones are not durable enough to withstand prolonged use.  They sound nice and my IPOD powers them enough for a pleasent sound.  However, they do smash your head and push on your ears.  Good enough for $40.00"
748,2,"I ride a scooter (aka Vespa) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while I'm riding, so I decided to buy this and so far I'm pleased. I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience."
749,1,"The mouse is rather lousy, and chews through batteries really fast.  The mouse is so bad I ended up buying a different wireless pointing device."
750,0,"I bought it, put in the batteries, and immediately needed a magnifying glass to read the worst LCD display I have ever seen (actually, could not see) in my life. After squinting and fumbling through some programming features, I started to feel that I was doing something wrong. I realized that I could select all devices to program EXCEPT THE TV! You simply cannot program the TV! You can program a digital cable box, a vcr, ... etc. But the device acts like it will let you select the TV BUT IT DOES NOT! Sony cost me hours of shopping and a couple of frustrating hours to find that they shipped a broken product. This will make me think twice about other Sony products' quality in the future."
751,0,I bought this at the apple store when I got my iPod (major selling point of iPod is to connect it to car stereo!) but it only had four preset stations that would never come in and faded out quickly if you were ever able to get a signal.  I suggest you find the Transpod if you want the best in FM signal transmitting.  I currently have the sf120 and it is a nice option.  In the end I will probably have to get a better stereo for a direct plugin for the MP3 players.
752,2,"I am very pleased with these headphones.  They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great."
753,0,"Plantronics should be ashamed of themselves, selling this for $70.00. It is not even worth $5. You can clearly hear a lot of static and hissing sound in speakers and headphone mode. The wires are extremely CHEAP, THIN, and FRAGILE. You can clearly see it from the pictures. They are NOT copper. It is some kind of cheap metal that deteriorates over time. Mine is 6 years old, and I assure you that there are deteriorations on all ends. Because of the audio issue, I never continued using it. Plantronics don't seem to have many well built products, I had a pair of Plantronics headphone that slowly broke off over time too. If you have good speakers and headphone, this switch will make it sound like analog radio. I'm warning you people, DON'T buy it. There are much better alternatives out there. Also, the base is not weighted so it doesn't stay put if you have thick wires. That clear piece of plastic under the switch is not a light indicator, don't be fooled. The design makes no sense, except marketing gimmick. But the main problem is really the static and hissing sound cause by the cheap built quality, that reason alone should be enough for anyone to stay away from it."
754,0,The ad did not show the receiver and that fact that it was on a cord. This device might be good for a desktop application but not for a laptop or traveler.
755,1,"While I really wanted to purchase a VR lens, I couldn't afford it at the time, so I decided to purchase this lens for some neighborhood wildlife shots...Overall performance great, but you must have a tripod to avoid the likely blur to to no Vibration Reduction...I just purchased the VR version today and will be selling this one soon..."
756,0,"My second netgear fs605 v3 just died.  Neither was over a year old.  It didn't actually die and I wish it had because then I would have at least had a good head start on where my problems were.  Instead, it just quits transmitting the internet.  It is actually still working with some non-internet components, but after having two of them fail for the same reason, I am done."
757,0,"My unit -- I've discovered too late -- has an internal ground circuit problem. It puts intermittent bands on any pass-through VGA and on the converted RCA composite output. The ""dirty"" output is so bad, I'll have to replace this. I'm stunned Startech would release such a cheaply-made product. Very disappointed. Wish I could send it back for a refund."
758,2,They are good wire ties.  A little long and need to be trimmed for most applications or you are wrapping a wire bundle multiple times but better too long than too short.
759,0,"Not only is this unnecessarily large (my fault for not checking the dimensions), but my 3 prong plug won't fit into it. The grounding hole seems to be in the wrong place (I am in America and the same plug fits my 3 outlet Belkin surge just fine). Weirdly, the packaging says good for modems, etc. - but there is no way to plug one in.In all, my plan to have a small surge protector in places I need them is scrapped. Even if I could connect, this is big, bulky and ugly. Not worth the postage to return."
760,2,"Stop looking and just get these. They don't feel as comfortable as some other headphones, but they sound great!I love the retro look too."
761,0,It made like a toy and does not sound loud. Actually my current cordless phone is louder than this one. It has been returned.
762,2,Ha widths years ago.Design looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch (tight or loose) which is nice.As ever great sonice and the price I got it for ($25!!!) was a steal.Great choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performance!!!!!!!!
763,0,"The old expression ""a camel is a horse designed by a committee"" best describes the Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman.RIGHT MOUSE SWITCH: This is the only good switch on the mouse.  Easy to use and a nice, light tactile response.  How often do you right click though?LEFT MOUSE SWITCHES: They are small and require 5X as much pressure as the right mouse switch to activate.  Using them is like having to push on stiff little warts all day.  If you suffer from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, these switches sill be sending waves of pain through your thumb by the end of the day.SCROLL WHEEL:  The awkward placement of the scroll wheel was obviously driven by available real estate on the device as opposed to ease of use.  It is as fluid to operate as a pepper grinder.  The micro buttons are still little contraptions that require you to lift your hand off the mouse so that you can press straight down.  They're essentially tiny, useless little things.BAD WRIST DESIGN:  This trackball puts a lot of bad pressure on the wrist. If you have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome you'll feel it quick. If not, the wrist design flaw of this trackball will likely cause you to develop Carpal Tunnel Syndrome sooner than later.This company designed the venerable Marble FX. It was an elegant trackball and used ones sell for 5X the original price on eBay.  It is a shame they abandoned form and function ergonomics in favor of gizmos and competitive check lists."
764,0,"Bought this item for use at the office. We rarely used it.  After a few months, it just stopped working.  It now makes a grinding noise when it tries to access any floppy disk.  Next time, I'll try to buy something a little more reliable.  Glad it worked for so many reviewers.  Unfortunately, it didn't work very long for me, so I can't recommend it."
765,2,I purchased these to do some organizing in my drop ceiling.  Wrap this around a couple of cables and you are good to go.I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 because I have found that they do not last too long when exposed to outdoor elements.  I know that using them for Christmas lights and in the garden are not how they were intended but I did it anyway.  I found that they would only last a portion of the season before they became brittle and would break.  I probably should use thicker ones for applications like this but I still would have liked them to last a little longer than that.
766,2,"This is a great tool for those shots where you want to get down low.  Macro work and landscape/waterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without.  I have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole time.Now for the negative.  It fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece, which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions.  And the big one for me, especially with macro work, you loose some light when using the angle finder.  So if you are already working in a low-light situation, this only makes matters worse.But in well-lit conditions where fogging is not an issue and you want to shoot low, this is an amazing accessory, thus the 4 out of 5 stars."
767,0,"I used to use this cord when I first got the calculator and it was a godsend, so since I lost it and am taking applied calculus II I thought I could definitely benefit from it again. However, after receiving it and wasting a few hours trying to make it work I contacted Texas Instruments, and they told me that the cord does not work with Mac OS X 10.6.8 and above or Windows 7. So unless you buy an old operating system this cord will not work with any new computer made within the last year. I was kind of disappointed that TI cares that little about their calculator customers and wish there was another brand that could keep up with TI but sadly they seem to have the monopoly :-("

A better solution is to set another group A or B Speedlite on manual and dial in the required output.Flash exposure compensation (FEC) can be set on a hot shoe mounted 580 series Speedlite used as a slave trigger to control FEC to compatible Speedlite slave groups.  The ST-E2 CANNOT perform this task.  Instead, you can walk over to each slave and set the FEC to achieve the same effect.Direct line of sight indoors is USUALLY not required.  The building's interior hard surfaces help in bouncing the wireless signal to the slave(s).The ST-ET comes with a black coloured pouch having the same rugged material as the 580 series pouches.To conclude, one star was removed for the:[1] odd size battery which is not carried in all stores[2] inability to control group C slave(s)[3] lack of control over FEC (not a problem because the unit has rear buttons to adust the flash ratio in 1/2 stop increments for groups A and B slaves), manual flash (each slave must be individually set) and stroboscopic flash (each slave must be individually set)The Canon ST-E2 Speedlite Transmitter is not as sophisticated as the Nikon SU-800 Wireless Speedlight Commander.  The ST-E2 which doesn't come cheap is half the price and size of the more versatile 580 series Speedlite used as slave triggers."
771,2,"I loved this when I had it but I unfortunately lost it when I was out one day.  I primarily used it to make my headphones at the time longer so I could lay down in bed and watch tv.  It did not affect the volume or quality.  I also used it to make my earbuds longer while I was on the go, I primarily use public transportation, so I could put my mp3 player in my bag and simply use the volume control as needed since I would clip that part to my pants or my bag.I plan on getting a replacement."
772,0,"I live in north Orange County and I found that even after searching for a ""sweet"" spot for HDTV...this antenna picked up a grand total of ZERO channels on a Onkyo medium high-end receiver.  If you live in Orange County don't waste your money on this.  BTW: this antenna is not amplified. I am going to pursue amplified antennas next...The attic is tough for me since I have a two-story home and wiring from the attic to the downstairs den......would be significant.  This antenna is identical to the Philips antenna just branded with a different moniker.***NOT recommended****"
773,1,This speaker set sounds great don't get me wrong. BUT... there is one HUGE flaw in the design that they have not sorted out after all of these years. The DIN Plug. Once this goes bad your entire nice system is utter trash. What sounded great is now dead because of one input to the sub that powers the entire unit aside from the AC. Wiggling the cable to try to get it in the perfect spot to get sound. Because of this issue I have decided not to purchase another set. All you have to do is google it. This is a known issue... FOR A LONG TIME.
774,0,"It's very stiff, thick cord and any time it moves, there's crackling heard in the sound. It's passable so long as I keep it fixed in one place, so for the low price, it's not worth the fuss of a return."
775,1,"Like most Nikon digitals, this camera offers excellent image quality.  A good zoom, excellent macro mode, and pretty good ease of use.  However, I think the design is awful.For starters, the swiveling lens.  Due to the design, people have a tendency to put their fingers all over the lens while swiveling it.  Also, tilt it up too far and you'll be taking a picture of the plastic housing of the camera--oops!  Perhaps the biggest design flaw in this camera is lack of a viewfinder.  I guess depending on your situation it may not matter, however if you live where I live (bright, SUNNY Florida) and you take pictures outside, that LCD screen is virtually useless.  It gets washed out, you're not going to be able to see what you're doing, and you'll wish you had bought a camera that has an optical viewfinder.  I don't understand how Nikon could have omitted that from a camera.The only real advantage this camera has over competing manufacturers' cameras is the macro mode.  Nikon is tough to beat in that respect.  That aside, look at a Canon Elph if you're looking for a small camera.  The image quality is just as good, you still get a zoom, and you get an optical viewfinder."
776,2,I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.
777,2,"Does not work well in bright sun, but indoors, and when dark, the IR does well. I shoot weddings and local shows, and lighting is always changing, the Ettl is a must, and is also great as a auto-focus assist (really great in low light)."
778,0,"Buyer beware: this is no longer the same product. Maxell has recently changed their audio CDRs.  Formally, they were manufactured in Japan; now they are made in Taiwan. All the older Maxell discs would play in EVERYTHING. However, a large percentage of discs in this new CDR media are defective. The new discs will no longer play in my Panasonic boom box or in my Honda car stereo.  Worse, some of these CDs will fail to play in anything after a few days."
779,1,"Well, years ago, I saw the Sony surround headphones (MDR-DS*) and thought they would be pretty cool. The price scared me stiff.Now you have these and the Sennheiser RS 65, with similar praise and criticism.For me, the hiss was annoying, but after laying back to watch my movie, I was able to &quot;retune&quot; the hiss to a decent level, then the movie drowned out the rest. I'm not sure how much if a surround effect there was (I forgot to test that), but the headphones could play action scenes pretty well.For the prices that they're available for, with included NiMH batteries, it's hard to argue against them.I'm keeping mine, though I'm hoping to compare to the Sennheisers soon.How is it that cordless phones are worry free in 900MHz up to 5+GHz, and we can't get decent headphones?"
780,0,"Slow to focus, if your subject is fast like my 10 month old daughter your better off trying to take a mental picture because this lens will not deliver. I got rid of this guy and put down the extra $220 bucks for the USM f1.4. So much faster, more accurate to focus and doesn't constantly hunt like the f1.8. The build quality of the f1.8 is not good at all, it always felt like something was loose in side the lens. I took it to a local camera shop and I was told that's how the lens sounds. it's meant to be a cheap 50 for starters so Canon didn't focus on quality and it shows. For the price tag you really can't complain but at the same time I wouldn't compare it to f1.4 because the only thing they have in common is the 50mm focal length."
781,0,"I have one of these DUB-H7 hubs that I use on my home computer (iMac), and it works perfectly and always has.Fast-forward to ~2 years later, and I purchased one for my office machine, also an iMac (and almost the exact same model).  This thing doesn't function well at all.  It rarely recognizes a flash drive that I use to carry files back and forth from home to work, and it's never had that problem at home.  When it does recognize the flash drive, it randomly disconnects it and in the process corrupted a large document I was working on!  Luckily I had a backup at home from the previous day, but I still lost a lot of time.Looking through the reviews here, it seems that although the model number of this new unit is the same as the one I purchased ~2 years ago, D-Link has significantly changed the packaging, accessories, and apparently the internals and/or design, because I'm having the same problems that everyone else is having with power not being delivered via the powered ports, USB devices disconnecting for no reason, printers not being recognized, etc.Even though this is the first problem I've had with a D-Link product, reading the reviews here and elsewhere has made it clear that I can't trust D-Link to make a decent product anymore.  I doubt I'll ever purchase a D-Link product again, as it appears they don't care at all about the issues their customers are having."
782,2,"At this price point, you're not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noise-canceling ability. I'd say that I've gone through a pair every few years, and I'll continue to buy these as needed. They block some sound, the sound quality is fine, and you won't be devastated when you realize that you've forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pair."
783,1,"I thought I could use these to replace my 10&#34; Woofers in a home stereo speaker cabinet. I was greatly disappointed. Though the speakers appear to be very well made, they are 4ohm speakers and even when driven with a 100 Watt/ channel reviever, do not give the booming bass that I expected."
784,0,"As other reviewers have written the first thing I noticed is that there are only 3 sheets, not 12 as the title implies. The way you achieve 12 sheets is by cutting them in fourths which makes them too small for my camera. I can get 6 sheets effectively. Furthermore, the kit comes with a wet cloth to clean the screen before applying. The drawback is that the kit comes with only wet cloth, so unless all 12 (or 6 or 3) protectors are applied at once, the single will only be moist for the first application. Finally, I agree that it is very difficult to apply these cleanly.This product works great for a single use if you have the patience to apply them."
785,2,"I have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother. It's more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product. If somebody really wanted to cut the cable or rip the lock out, I'm sure they could. But, it would be easier just steal the laptop right next to it with no lock. That's the reason I use it."
786,2,"Although this is a small bag you can fit the essentials in it, I carry my Nikon D70 with a couple of lenses, the charger, and the lens cleaning kit and that all fits fine. I would have rated it a 5 but due to the tripod straps the main bag zipper can be a bit tricky to open."
787,2,"The Koss VC20 volume controller really does what it's suppose to. Not really much else to say about it, honestly."
788,2,"This item is a good add-on to my canon DSLR. It is compact, simple and works well. The only problem is this remote control seems not very sensitive. You have to point it straight to your camera accurately, or it won't work."
789,2,"Bought this unit based on reviews listed here--have not been disappointed.  Nice unit, easy to use and of seemingly good quality.  Happy customer!"
790,2,"This cordless mouse simply feels great in my hand.  I've owned about 10 different mouses and this one pleases me because it feels like part of my hand rather than part of the PC.  I find that my thumb moves the trackball effortlessly while my index finger shifts almost without thought between the wheel and buttons.  I seem to get consistent communication between the mouse and the receiver as I've not noticed any performance problems.  Batteries last about a year and the mouse tells you when they are getting low by posting an alert.Also, I share this mouse with my two children.  It's been dropped on a hardwood floor more than I probably know about.  And it still works.Excellent design and reliable service.  I hope this review helps."
791,1,"The Olympus D-380 is a very reliable if you want to snap a picture of the family. I have been using this camera for about two years and it has just been awesome, even though it lacks a few things, which I will get into in just a bit. I mainly photograph dirtbikers, BMX, and race trucks. This little camera does the trick in capturing fast moving objects. Also, it does very well with not getting messed up with all the dirt and dust in the air when photographing motorsports - I have never had a problem with this at all. It has very decent resolution as well, but definitely not enough if you're past the novice stage of photography. I am very pleased with this camera considering it is an older model, but there were a few downsides to this camera which has caused me to seek a newer model. The most annoying problem that I have every time that I use this camera is that the battery compartment on the bottom of the camera is one of those sliding latches. It always slides out, causing all four batteries to spill onto the floor. So you have to be really careful when taking pictures to stay away from the battery compartment. Also, the batteries don't last very long, especially if you use the LCD and review your pictures often. A brand new set of batteries lasted me about an hour to maybe an hour and a half or so, with the camera on the whole time, snapping about 70 - 100 pictures. Another issue is when zooming in, the quality of the picture becomes very degraded - spotty and blurry. And sometimes the flash is too strong when indoors, it makes for too much contrast and loss of color in pictures. And when using no flash or the night time flash, it comes out too dark or sometimes blurry - if your hand shakes or moves. So, this is why I say that this camera is awesome if you just take general pictures but not if you are pursuing high quality shots."
792,0,"This thing just stopped working about 45 days after I bought it!  I can't believe it!! It seemed sturdy, good quality, but then died.  What's worse, it had only been used once or twice as an extension cord for my power drill!!OMG!! I can't believe it!"
793,2,"big enough to fit the camera with extra lens ,with extra pocket for accessory , nicely design, great value, good material."
794,0,"I bought these headphones based on a good review at Tom's Hardware, but I am sorely disappointed in them.  The noise cancellation feature does work (15dB only), but the sound quality is really bad.  The biggest complaint is that the bass is severely attenuated, but the mid-range and highs also sound uneven -- as though the frequency response is not very flat.  My 16-year old son thinks the inexpensive Panasonic headphones that came with his $49 CD player ""sound a lot better"".  Maybe these just need to get broken in, but if they sound this bad when new, I'm not going to wait --  I'm returning them.  I would not buy these at $20, and certainly not at $100+."
795,2,they work well and seem very strong. more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound.
796,2,"These are awesome headphones. I work in a crowded (load) office, and there are days that would be almost unbearable without these headphones. I am able to crank up the volume, and the sound quality is excelent. The bass produced from such a small package is remarkable.I did have to replace one set of the cushions after a few years, and eventualy one of the speaker wires started to short out. Koss stood behind their lifetime warrenty, and replaced the unit.The first pair of headphones I bought (in the '80s) were from Koss, and my experiences with their lifetime warrenty has made me a lifetime customer."
797,2,"I have many headphones, many of the head band variety and some of the conventional earbud variety. This is my first purchase of the in the ear type. I never expected the fit to be as comforatble as I found it to be, and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is. I think that Koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product. On top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee. How can you beat this bargain?"
798,0,"I have one of these mice, but it wasn't purchased here.  Like several other Microsoft mice I have purchased it came with a defective microswitch under the left button.  Most of the time it works, but sometimes when you single-click you get a double.  Microsoft mice used to be great, they are no more.I have purchased 4 or 5 of the past couple years out of brand loyalty and only 1 of them worked correctly out of the box and it only lasted a few months."
799,2,Have used item very little but pleased with it. I would recommend to anyone with need of such a device.
800,0,"If you enjoyed computing in the days of the Commodore 64, and hey, who didn't, then this is the router for you!First the boring stuff: the router is acceptable in terms of performance, though in an older house you'll have trouble getting a signal twenty-five feet away because of the thicker walls.The real fun comes in setting up, or in my case re-setting up the modem.  Let the adventures in user friendliness begin!  Check out this link for a preview of what you have in store:[...]None of this graphical user interface nonsense for Linksys, we're back in the glory days of eight hour installs (Pool of Radiance, anyone?), physical copy protection and ""press play on tape"" if you forgot to tell the computer that your program was on the floppy drive not teh tape player.Searching for the Router takes a full minute.  The thing is directly connected to the computer and it takes a minute to find.  ""Make sure the internet light is blinking"", great strategy, thanks Napoleon!  Linksys has a great way of helping you when your router cannot find the internet, you just chat online with one of their techs.  I'll let you know how that turns out.  I am 36th in line after a mere 15 minute wait.Go ahead, buy this router, everyone else does.  But if you get it working, never ever touch anything ever again.  Ever.  Unless you want to experience the 1980s again.  Excuse me while I press ""play on tape""."
801,0,"I have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop.  Look/feel and general use are fine for short periods of time (~&lt; 1 hour).  However, I am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem:  Intermittently, after clicking/double-clicking, the mouse will go into a ""move to the left"" mode...and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen.  Sometimes it will move to the upper-left.  This is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable.  I will often (at least 10 times in a 30 minute period) have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing.  Frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi-level menu, for instance.  Another example is if you working on any CAD-type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time (mouse will move when it feels like it).It was ok for a while, but now it is annoying...going to buy a replacement.If I have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life, it gets no more than 2 stars.  It could be just this one particular mouse, but then that points to lack of QA at the manufacturer end...again, 2 stars."
802,2,"Sound great for the price and size. Very portable, very sturdy, and very cheap. 5 star worthy on that alone.Lots of bass, not the best bass but it is fun to listen too sometimes. The low end is definitely exaggerated but not like other reviews would have you believe.Mids are good, a little lifeless but very god to listen too on the go. Accuratish, and they aren't over emphasized.The highs, ehn. Well again they aren't great but they really do sound nice, if that makes sense. They aren't perfect and at times sound a little slow but these aren't $200 can either, they can be had for $25 if you know when to buy.Value:  10/10 Nothing in this price range competes.Build Quality: 8/10 Very well built but not indestructible.Sound Overall: 7/10 There are better portable phones.Sound Value  : 10/10Overall rating: 9/10I can't give 4.5 stars so I give it 5.On a side note my pair weren't like the picture, more like the best buy pair in one of the buyers note pictures."
803,0,"The only way I could make it work was to hold the S-video/component switch halfway in.  Other than that it seemed to work fine!  Seriously, though  holding the switch is not acceptable.  I returned this item."
804,0,"I bought these because I had tried several other headphones, one costing $1500 and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable. These were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so I figured, what did I have to lose by trying them. The answer to that question is, shipping to and from Amazon.I cannot recommend them, even for $45.00."
805,0,"I can't believe I bought this thing.  The holder is of very poor design (cannot manipulate buttons easily) and the clip broke after 2 months of use (no accessory source to replace).  Now, like the other reviewer, I must hold the thing in my hand while running (kind of defeats the purpose of &quot;sport&quot; player doesnt it?) I don't care what anyone says, the radio stinks pure and simple.  I am going to try to take it back to the store I bought it at but am not real confident.  In any event, no more RIO products for me."
806,2,"Nicely padded, room for a couple filters and extra film.  Compact and great for carrying.  Caution!  Leave it zipped, because if you pick up this bag opened your camera will fall out."

808,0,"Originally purchased during the second fall of law school.  I was initially quite pleased with this device, but have changed my mind over the years.Pros: feature set far ahead of its time.Cons: build quality, build quality, build quality - the plug for the battery pops open, turning off the device (it never did snap quite right), the plug for the ear phones broke, disconnecting the sound, the color screen is too small to watch videos and is scratch prone, the battery life is a joke.Primary uses: recording lectures during law school (which worked sometimes, but often produced inaudible recordings - truly disappointing!), listening to MP3s (which worked most of the time, until the ear phones plug broke)Secondary uses:  portable hard disk for photos (20 GB let me enjoy my digicams, but watch out - sometimes it would say a card had been fully downloaded, but after trying to preview the photos, the images would be corrupted or unusable!)Unacceptable for uses such as: playing video - it just sucked!  too much of a pain to convert all my videos, too hard to watch, and when I tried, the battery didn't last long enoughIn short, too much was attempted, and too little delivered with this model. Compared to the limited feature set of the iPod, I stuck with the Archos - it just did sooo much more.But now it doesn't do anything at all, but just sit in my drawer collecting dust.  A tremendous pity."
809,0,"After about 1 hour with technical support (which was responsive but unable to solve the problem), I was able to connect one time.  I could never connect after that.  So, I gave up.  I have $5 bluetooth USB connectors that connect effortlessly."
810,0,Items arrived quickly and in great condition. However the cables did not last more than about three months each before they quit working. I was hoping for the two of them to last me a couple of years before needing replacement not just a few months. You get what you pay for I suppose.
811,1,"I've owned this camera for about a year now. Overall, I am pleased with it's performance, but in retrospect I think I would have been happier with the Canon Powershot G2 or G3. In ideal lighting situations, the camera performs very well and produces very good images. Battery life has been good, and Compact Flash is by far the best storage format.  However, in less-than-ideal conditions, I believe there are better cameras on the market.There two areas in which this camera has disappointed me are:1. Flash photography- The stated range of the flash unit on this camera is a bit shorter than others (~10 ft.), and in real-world conditions subjects appear very dimly lit in the upper end of that range. Other cameras in the same price/resolution category have flash ranges closer to 15 ft.2. Time between shots- The camera is rated at 5-seconds between shots in normal shooting mode. The Canon Powershot, for example, can take back-to-back shots in 2 seconds. This has been a problem for me when trying to capture movement and action shots.That being said, this camera is significantly less expensive than the Canon Powershot G2/G3.Hope this helps."
812,0,"The sound is clear but the pitch is way to high, almost squeaky. It is well made and will survive a noisy gym environment but it is not much use anywhere else."
813,2,"I bought this for a digital camera and spare memory cards and batteries. It holds all of those and room for a bit more. There is good padding that I am sure I will be thankful for when I drop it. Heavy duty... yes but, light weight. It's not slim at about 4&quot; thick. Comes with a detachable shoulder strap and a built-in belt loop. It has combo clip and velcro front flap."
814,0,Be aware that there are no drivers for Server 2003 x86 and it will not install using XP drivers. Was hoping this would be the case.
815,1,"The wires are not clearly distinguishable and only have a white line to differentiate the 2 speaker wires that is difficult to see in imperfect lighting conditions as it blends in with the reflection from the copper wire. I got the speakers hooked up eventually, but had to try several a few times to get it right."
816,2,"Despite looking like they are straight out of 1993, these headphones sound like 2014.  Amazing sound quality that matches my studio headphones, with a durable 'on-the-go' construction.  Base is solid, highs are not peaky or harsh on the ears, and the mids are smooth and warm sounding.Very comfortable on the ears.My original pair stopped working, and I sent them to Koss and for $10 I had a brand new pair sent to me within 2 weeks!!Only complaint is that the way the metal band is designed with two pieces it can pinch your neck hair when sitting around your neck instead of on your head.  Minor complaint but it hurts!"
817,2,"This is more accurately called a Volume Limiter.  It can only decrease volume and cannot increase the volume from your device.  This is a very simple device that acts as a throttle on the volume provided by the output of your device.  It connects to the output of your device (an earphone jack) and then provides a connection for earphones or speakers.  Once the connection is made the in-line rheostat can reduce the volume.It does that very well and does not seem to add any static.  The controller operates smoothly up and down.  I use this between my laptop and an amplified set of speakers.  I set my laptop to 70% output and the amplifier to 70% which turns out to be very loud with the controller in the max position.  I then use the controller to reduce and increase volume without having to touch the laptop or the amplifier.when connected to my phone, I set the volume to high and reduce it as needed with the controller.  It saves having to activate the screen and taking the phone in and out of my pocket.  It is very handy and the extra cord length is handy for short corded earphones."
818,2,I bought this so that I could easily control the volume on my iPod Touch during bike rides and it does the job perfectly.
819,2,"The bad feature of this product is that it does have one velcro pad on the inside that allow you to re-size the storage compartments to your own personal needs, the rest of the pads, only have the velcro to adapt, but it is very limited.  I had the Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG for Canon EOS SLR Cameras, it's zippers were strong but difficult to manage, so I changed it for this bag; but I'm disapointed, because of the difficult to design your own space, the pads make it very limited.It can carry very well the tripods that are light.  I'm buying a 6 pounds tripod, and I don't know how is going to work in it."
820,0,"First of all, I'm a Microsoft Certified Professional. I'm not a deep geek, but I understand internet communication and what constitutes ""ease of use"".The D-Link DBT-120 USB dongle does plenty of ugly undocumented things. For example, it constantly monitors the Bluetooth exchange folder, which strangely slows my 850MHz system.What's very annoying is that it hooks into Microsoft Office applications and adds a menu option ""Send to Bluetooth"". This pings my firewall on UDP:37926 every time I start an office application, and even though I've allowed that port, it totally locks up my computer (the firewall logs show it allowing the communication, and blocking the communication). Right now, I have to disconnect from the internet, shut down my firewall, start the Office app, then re-start my firewall. I have this problem even when I kill the background process BTTRAY.EXE, which tells me that D-Link is hooked into my system in a very, very naughty way.This appears to be firewall independent - after prowling the newsgroups, I see that this occurs regardless of the firewall you use.So, I called D-Link's tech support. They REQUIRE your full name, telephone number, full address, and an email address. If you do not give them any of this, they will not help you.After many calls to D-Link's tech support, I'm 100% sure that all the problems are D-Link's fault. How do I know? For example, when they tell you to ""Call Microsoft"". That's an old tech support trick to get you off the phone. Or, when they tell you to ""uninstall the product, then re-install it"". I did that the first time they told me. But in subsequent calls, they told me to do it again. That's another tech support trick to get rid of you.I called D-Link's tech support EIGHT TIMES in one day, each times hoping I'd get someone knowledgeable. Each call, including initial hold times and ""can you please hold"", lasted at least 45 minutes - the longest was 1 hour 30 minutes, after which they hung up.D-Link tech support is definitely not technical. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that they are not technical. NOBODY knew what a ""port"" is. Nobody. Nobody is technical. Nobody. Except for three of my eight calls, they either hung up, or placed me on hold and forgot about me. I know now that if I had bothered to check forums on the internet beforehand I'd know that this is how D-Link's support behaves when they can't solve a problem.I got one D-Link tech support guy who told me that ""it's your fault for using Microsoft. You should switch to Linux"". I was absolutely speechless. Can you believe this? When I regained my composure politely asked him, ""Are you saying D-Link products are incompatible with Windows?"", he placed me on hold, where I was disconnected after ten minutes.D-Link Bluetooth is horrible. Their tech support is shameful and a disgrace. Their software is intrusive, and does many ugly and undocumented things that slow your system and possibly violate your privacy (I don't have time to go into the other firewall issues - ex: it tries to access an outside IP address).This product is to be avoided at all costs."
821,0,Couldn't get it to work with MACH3. I followed all the steps from Artsoft themselves and couldn't get it to work. I ended up buying a Smoothstepper board and within 10 minutes I was turning parts.
822,2,"I bought this for my new ETrex Vista HCx for use with my mountain bike during those non crash style rides.  This mount is intended to replace the back cover of your GPSr and then clip onto the handlebar mount.  I discovered that the replacement cover is different than the original one in several ways.  First, it is all plastic with a much smaller, delicate o-ring seal than the original cover (which is made out of metal and has a beefy seal system.)  More importantly, the new cover does not fit on the HCx or others with microSD cards.  Hmmm.  I was ready to return it and I remembered that my new Vista HCx came with a screw mount ""auxiliary mount adapter"" that the instruction manual for the HCx says ""do not discard"".  Lo and behold, screw that baby onto the original sturdy beefy o-ring sealed metal back and it clips onto the handlebar mount perfectly.  This is much better than the replacement back that comes with the mount kit.  Now I have an unused back cover for any non HCx design Etrex to sell.  Garmin does sell just the bar mount piece for suggested retail $10.91, so I lost money on the deal, but I don't have to return anything and my mount is stronger than the original design that Garmin had.  I only deducted one star for the quality of the kit's plastic replacement back cover that non-HCx users will have to use."
823,0,"The tripod is not terrible.  Good rotation on 3 axis.  Good height extension, it's lightweight and the quick release plates are very handy.  Unfortunately the locking mechanism for one of the legs gave out on me the 4th or 5th time that I used it.  Also because of it's light weight it's a little jittery (especially with a DSLR and long lens attached) and probably needs a 5lb sandbag to keep it steady in a moderate wind."
824,2,"This time I bought a new pair because my cat decided to play with the old pair. (These are not cat toys but how do you convey that to a cat that doesn't listen anyway?) The pair I bought before these was for a family member who still loves them and has given a pair as a gift to a few friends.When inserted correctly, these are better than the $200+ Bose noise cancelling headphone and MUCH cheaper. The sound quality is outstanding and the cable is durable... except when a cat plays with it. I do suggest you purchase the ear bud replacements as well since these can get a bit funky after being used for a while. Also, make sure you purchase the correct ear buds. I learned the hard way that Koss makes different buds for their headphones."
825,0,"I bought it from amazon.com when it was on sale.  It worked fine for over a year until I encountered some technical issues when I was changing the wideband internet service provider.  I needed some technical assistance, and I called Netgear's customer service.  Although I never called them before, and never had to bother them for help, they told me that I could not receive any assistance since the purchase had exceeded the three-month period unless I agreed to pay a huge hourly rate.  I was upset very much and vowed never to use Netgear's prodcut again!Fortunately, there are other vendors in the market.  I bought a Linksys wireless router as replacement.  It is such a pleasant experience to use and get help any time I need from Linksys's customer service!  I was told that technical supprt for the product is lifetime, and I have since asked for technical support twice (about 14 months apart, the last time when I moved and had to reinstall the router in my new place).  I really want to say many thanks to Linksys and their excellent customer service.  And surely I will NEVER be a Netgear's customer!"
826,2,"Wish I bought this sooner.  This is wonderful for taking photographs of yourself on trips. I had my camera for a long while, and have only rarly taken pictures of myself on my trips. I end up coming back with pictures of my wife, the scenery...but rarely myself. This remote changed it. The reason I dont give it 5 stars is that you need to be relatively close to the camera. Wish it worked from a greater distance. Also, it would have been nicer if it was radio-controlled rather than infra-red. In order for it to work, I have to stand on one side, in direct line of sight of the sensor. Not a big deal, but you have to take this into account when positioning yourself in a group."
827,2,"Recommended by CNET, these headphones are light, portable, and have the best sound I've heard in this price range.I originally bought them for a laptop, and now I use them on every audio device I own. Great product, excellent price."
828,1,"Here's the thing.. I may just be spoiled and am used to high-end mp3 players, but I really think this is only an average player.The overall size of the unit is quite big. It's like carrying a computer hard drive around in your pocket all day, and then putting  about 1 or 2 inches of useless plastic over it. The overall shape and size of the Archos is way too bulky for my preference. It looks more like a bomb to me, and not an mp3 player.Secondly, I found the sound quality to be sub-par compared to other players. I ripped an entire nirvana CD at the highest possible quality, and found that my iPod and my iRiver Slimx-550 still sounded better. Why? I have a feeling that this is because the amplifier in the unit is a bit weaker than those found in the iPod, for example. This is not a bad thing if you are a whimpy listener and only listen at medium volumes. I, on the other hand, have practically made it a goal to become deaf, and this unit won't help me accomplish that feat.I found the Archos easy to control in my testing of it, however it was lacking in the &quot;quick and easy&quot; department. The controls are a bit awkward and hard to initiate unless you have the unit infront of you. If you just want to go to the next song on your list with the unit in your pocket, only experienced listeners of this unit will be able succeed in that. I constantly had to pull the thing out of my pockets and look at what I was doing. The unit is just too bulky and too complicated to understand without using your sense of sight.My last complaint about this unit, while not a big one for most people, is the community. I am a Linux user, and when I did research on this mp3 player to see if I could get some 3rd party apps to get this thing direct-linked to my linux system, it was no-go. I really wish this player had a bigger community, or else I'd have maybe kept this player.In the long run, however, this player is still average. For the price, you get a nice package and you can't go wrong with that. The capacity of this unit is quite high for the price, and that's a good thing. However, I think that in this day and age, it isn't worth the money you save to get a player of such a lower quality. That is just my opinion. I am sure many people would like to beg to differ, but for a high-end music goer like me, I need something smaller and of higher quality. Can this unit benefit? It sure can! Just make sure that if you ever buy this, that you are not expecting to cary this in your pocket for on-the-run sort of things, or for school. For that kind of a unit, I'd go for an iPod or the new iRiver device coming out soon. On the low end, get the newest Mp3CD player from iRiver, the SlimX 550. It's a great CD player and has features not found on the iPod and other similar units.I hope this review helped. Overall, this is an average mp3 player. The reason it gets this average score is for the price that you pay to get such a high-storage device. Many features, such as the size, and sound quality, need improving, but you get what you pay for. :)"
829,0,"I received my Dana a few days ago. I set it up as the manual explained and started writing. I do enjoy using the Dana for writing. As a graduate student in a writing program, it gave me what I wanted: something ultra-portable, lightweight and inexpensive without the distractions of a full-blown laptop. The keyboard is nice to use and I find I'm able to write better when I can't tell how many pages I've written or not written and I'm not concerned about editing on-the-fly. For me, the Dana serves one function: to get the words out of my brain and into some form of word processing machine.I wrote for four hours on Friday night and felt quite accomplished and good about what I'd gotten out. I had every intention of transferring my work into my computer this morning (Sunday). When I turned the Dana on this morning, my work was gone. No files at all in AlphaWord. Nothing. My husband is a software engineer. He has tried everything he could think of to find my ONE saved file, and it's just gone. Naturally, AlphaSmart only has technical support available on weekdays. I have a deadline to meet, and now with four hours of work gone, I'm stuck using my Sunday afternoon to replicate what I wrote on Friday. I am furious and very disappointed. I have a feeling I'll be returning it."
830,1,The width between my wears is not more than average.  But if you wear these for more than about an hour (say playing a video game so that your spouse doesn't get upset with all of the booms and crashes) your ears will ache.  The sound is very good but you just can't wear them that long.
831,0,"I owned a perfectly wonderful Pioneer, 100 Disc CD changer. Since my CD collection had approached the 400 mark, I decided to purchase the Sony CDP-CX455 unit, so that I could randomly listen to my entire collection, without constantly changing CD's. After reading some of the reviews on Amazon, I was reluctant to purchase this unit. Unable to find another unit that would accomodate 400 CD's, I decided to take a chance and went ahead with the purchase. Big mistake! After spending hours loading the CD's into the system and setting it to play on random(shuffle), I soon discovered that several of my CD's were skipping. I am meticulous with the handling of my CD's, so I know that the problem was not caused by my mishandling of them. I removed the CD's that were skipping, hoping that this was an isolated incident. The next day, I turned on the unit and again set it to play songs randomly. Once again, some of the CD's started skipping. When I removed them from the unit, I noticed that there were scratches on both CD's. I then called up Sony to explain to them that this particular CD changer has an engineering defect, and that it scratches CD's. Their response was that they have had no reports of such incidences. I asked to speak with a supervisor, who informed me that this CD changer has been taken off the market and is not being replaced with a similar unit. He said that stores still had them in stock, but once the stock was exhausted there would be no more available. I then asked him why they were not replacing this unit with another 400 CD changer model, and was told that they are getting out of the CD changer business, in favor of DVD/CD combo units. I offered the comment that the reason they are not replacing the CDP-CX455 with a similar unit, is because they know that the CDP-CX455 has an engineering defect, and they are not capable of building a 400 CD unit that is problem free. At any rate, I called the store where I purchased my changer from, and told them that I was returning it because it was scratching my CD's. I then started the long process of removing the CD's from the system and was astounded to find that almost 1 out of every 3 CD's had been scratched by this CD changer. I called back Sony, and their attitude was basically that they couldn't care less. Once you buy a Sony product, you are on your own. Their customer support is non existent. Despite the fact that over 100 of my CD's have been damaged by this unit, their response was that they were sorry, but there is nothing they could do about it. Based on this incident, I will never purchase another Sony product again. If you are planning to purchase this CD player, my advice to you, &quot;Buyer Beware.&quot;"
832,2,"This little machine is great.  There are, of course, a few small features that I'd prefer (like a more detailed display) but that really doesn't matter.  I yank a CD full of mp3s and pop it in my car cassette player using the adapter.  Push the 'random' button and I'm good to go for about two weeks of commutes to and from work.The thing is obviously pretty durable since it's been sitting in my car since I bought it over 6 months ago - It has been frozen in the winter and sat for hours in the blazing sun - still works like a charm.Glitches have been *very* rare - maybe one skip in every 50 tracks played. Money well spent!"
833,1,I prefer Kensington Products for my Mac's but this mouse causes me some pause.It works well but not as slick as all my many other Kensington products. The softwareseems to be the biggest issue so far. It's old software that comes with this mouse.Go to the Kensington downloads to get the updated software then the mouse is fine.This mouse works better than the standard mouse that comes with a Mac.Will I buy kensington again? Sure I will!! Their service and warranty make all thedifference to me.

837,0,"I've been using some Polk Audio TSi100's (driven by a Sonos Connect:Amp) for about two years.  But recently I somehow got the idea that maybe I could get even better sound quality with some Bose Bookshelf speakers (301's), especially because they have speakers pointed in many directions.  The guy at the Bose store assured me that some 301's would definitely fill the room better, and give higher-quality sound.They did not.  The 301's sound quality was obviously and clearly inferior to my TSi100's (which are smaller, perhaps better-looking, and much cheaper).  Toggling back and forth between the speakers, it sounded as if the Bose were sitting in a long tunnel; trebles and mids were flatter and dull-sounding.  Even if I custom-tuned my EQ for the Bose, the TSi100's (at the same EQ settings) still sounded better!  It's rare that something on the market is priced so inappropriately (...not sure if it's the Polk or the Bose), but it moved me to write this review.I had expected more from Bose after hearing a Bose Wave radio, which, for its size, produces amazing sound; but the 301's, honestly, didn't sound that great."
838,2,There's hardly any problem in life that cannot be sorted with cable ties. These work great they're very strong and I've used them for everything from putting up signs to assembling an eBike.
839,2,"My product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag. Comes with two keys with bright orange tags. and a Paper Manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them. Never got the link to the site to work, so codes were practically useless.The cable has two different ends. One end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop.The end with the lock can swivel, so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled.I wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop. This way, unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk, they should not be able to steal the physical laptop. Unless they were aiming for the Hard Drive, graphics card, or DDR3 RAM; that would be a different story.Cable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables. It has a diameter of roughly ~&#60; 1 cm. So a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in half.This is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment. Better than nothing.&#62;&#62;&#62;Final Thoughts&#60;&#60;&#60; I only got this since I needed to use my laptop on my desk at my part-time job, and I can't be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time I step away from the desk.Keeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop. If they were aiming at the components of your laptop, all they need is a Phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves. Or if they had a good compact cable cutter, which nowadays are quite small.For ~$31, not a bad deal. TO me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner. The long cable is good if I ever needed the extra length.Fits in my ASUS 15.6 inch N53SV-EH72 laptop and my Acer 14 inch V5-471P-6498 laptop.May recommend to others, I don't know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing. :D"
840,1,"I thought, since this is a well-known brand and has a list price of $119.99, that the device would be made of heavy duty, high quality materials.  It works fine and seems reasonably designed, but it is quite light, which is good for portability except for the fact that you don't really need to move it around much, and ""feels cheap"".  So I expected it to be made of heavier components. It feels like a $25 surge protector, not a $119.99 surge protector.  However, I have not opened it up to see its innards, and they may be quite good...it hasn't failed yet.  In the end all that matters is how it deals with a surge.  I've used it for my home theater for 6 months so far."
841,0,"I bought this to copy my stack of vinyl to CD's. Unfortunatly, the record players cheap price reflects its performance. I was not able to copy a single LP to CD without it skipping tracks. There are no adjustments on the turntable. I finally dug out my old Dual 1218 and revived it enough to use it. There is no match between my 30+ year old Dual and the PL50. So far the Dual has played all records without a single skip. After spending many hours trying to be happy with my purchase, I finally threw the PL50 in the trash. I would not want to sell it in a garage sale or on eBay to someone who would expect a turntable that they could use. Save your money, don't buy this one."

I was thrilled to discover they're still available after all these years.  They're comfortable and durable, and they sound great.  Lifetime warranty, too. Very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century. The Koss PortaPros are tried and true, and still relevant. Imagine that."

Apparently, though, it will provide power ONLY through the &#34;power&#34; port.  (Unlike, say, every other USB hub known to man.)  Either that, or the other three ports stopped working after three weeks (and virtually no use).Alas, I was in a hurry, and didn't read the other reviews saying it was a piece of junk, nor did I keep the packaging to return it.I do wonder about the webpage where the other person said they were using it for exactly the purpose I wanted to use it..."
847,2,Works great and I'm glad I got this with the purchase of my new Audio-Technica ATH ANC7 headphones.
848,1,"I've had two of these for over four years and they work well for where I've placed them. They are rather cheaply made. The battery contacts broke when removing a 9-volt battery. I'm not sure how well it works in weather because while mine are outside and I live in a very humid area, they are kept out of the rain.  The only reason I'm considering getting another brand is simply to have a different chime to hear so I can differentiate which motion detector is tripped.  When the batteries get low, the unit will chime repeatedly until they are changed out. The loudest setting is really loud, loud enough to be heard outside when people approach a porch or are near a window, so that could be a deterrent itself.  I have yet to notice anyone noticing the sensor where I have it mounted; it would be easy for someone to remove it.  Unlike the picture, my sensor has the ""Driveway Patrol"" name printed on it."
849,1,"yeah, the product is fine, until I told my neighbor to buy one also. I didnt realize the driveway patrol had only one frequency. So every time my neighbor sensor is trip my reciever would go on too.. Wahhhhhh. If your buying this item dont tell your neighbor."
850,2,I needed to prevent my cats from going between the vertical posts on the deck so I bought netting and then had to secure it without damaging the deck (I live in a condo).  These seemed like a good idea.  I've used them to secure the netting and even wove them thru the bottom to prevent it from moving too much so the cats can't get between the main deck 'floor' and the 2x3 used for the railing bottom.It's been up for almost a year now and survied Sandy!
851,2,I went to the store and tried a lot of these; this is the most comfortable one to me.  Plug & play. easy to use.  PS2 or USB.
852,0,"What's not specified in the item description is that if you mix and match USB 1.1 and USB 2 devices, the hub may only provide the much slower USB 1.1 speed for ALL ports. You don't read that in the product description. You have to wait until you purchase the item and read the documentation. So, don't plug an iPod mini and a USB 1.1 device (in my case a wireless mouse) into the same hub or your iPod may have major problems, as mine did. The iPod wants to run at full USB 2 speeds.Why is there a problem with the manufacturer providing that info in the description before you purchase the hub? This is highly deceptive, in my opinion."
853,1,Not as thick gauge as I was expecting.  I would go with 12 gauge wire the next time to ensure that the wiring is not the cause of any lost in audio fidelity.  As for regular speakers this worked out just fine.
854,2,"I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why."
855,2,These are great for tripod use and slow shutter speeds to prevent movement. Since it is a Canon product you know what you are getting.
856,1,"I ordered this bag for a new netbook I purchased because I wanted something a little more hardy than a simple sleeve.  As always, Targus has made a bag that looks good and is well padded, providing good protection for the netbook. It also has a second section that allows you to carry your power cord and/or external CD drive separate from the computer. Unfortunately, this bag appears to be designed so that you can use the computer while it is still in the bag.  This requires you to use a strap attached inside the bag to hold the computer in place.  This bag does not come with instructions as to HOW this strap is to be used, and the only way I can see to use it is to place it OVER the top of the keyboard,which obscures the center row of keys.  It is possible that this is not the intent of this strap, but being the clueless person I am... This bag also comes with side straps so that it doesn't open flat but stays in a propped position.  This is a good idea if you are using the netbook while inside the case, but can be a bit of a pain if your intent is to remove the 'book from the case.  The way these straps are attached makes it possible to adjust them, but you cannot remove them.  For what I wanted it for, and for it's price, it's not a bad bag."

859,1,"I bought these speakers to replace a speaker that had started to go out.  I had a set of Infinity ERS110 speakers on my patio, 1 of them started getting static (6 years old) so I did some research and bought these Polk speakers. I bought the pair just incase the other Infinity goes out.  Ease of installation was perfect, it fit into the existing hole and I had it in place and playing music in less than 5 minutes.  The problem is that it is very thin sounding compared to the Infinity. I left the working Infinity in place and installed 1 Polk in the broken Infinity's place.  You can definitely tell the difference between the 2 speakers.  The Infinity is much louder and has more base.  Clarity on the Polk is good, I just wish it had more substance.  As they are outside speakers I am not too concerned, I'm sure my neighbors will appreciate the quieter sounds, but if I was installing them inside for my TV or stereo I would definitely spend more money and choose another brand or style.  Delivery was excellent, I bought them on Monday morning and they were delivered on Tuesday night."
860,2,"Wonderful, very useful! My old portable radio and hardly responds to the volume control and I have returned to this attachment to use with headphones and volume control again."

Maybe it says that in the description (I need to check), but I didn't see it when I ordered it.At any rate, I wrapped the heck out of it with electricians tape, and it is working for now.But, if I had known, I would have ordered something else.IF you want something for indoor use, it is OK."

I would not recommend this software unless you really have the time to spend figuring it out.Google recently released a FREE home design software.  Much like other Google products, this one is very easy to use - although not as powerful as one you might purchase.  Before buying, I strongly recommend you check out Google's offering. Visit sketchup.google.com to take a look."
865,0,"Although this router had a lot of nice configuration features, I was disappointed to find that it fails miserably when it comes to performing some of the more basic (essential) router tasks.The DI-614+ requires a reset every couple of days because it flakes out and drop routing functionality through the WAN for all of my computers inside my local network with statically assigned IPs (you must assign static IPs to your machines if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the router) This is a HORRIBLE flaw that makes the router useless for any serious use.Another big problem is that it has a *VERY* weak routing implementation - if you keep TCP/IP connections open for more than 2 minutes without constant activity, kiss your connection goodbye. (i.e. don't expect to be able to use telnet, ssh, or ftp programs without your connection being dropped every time you leave your connection idle for more than 2 minutes) This problem didn't happen with my old linksys router.I emailed tech support on this one over 5 times - they just kept sending me back a cut-and-paste of the entire user manual - they're completely useless.Bottom line is - DON'T BUY THIS ROUTER. Get a different brand router, or a string and two paper cups, because communicating across the web with this router is so unreliable - it's worthless."

867,1,"These sound great and block out quite a bit of external noise, but they are quite uncomfortable for long periods of time.  They make my ears sore.  They need larger cups in my opinion and more space between the pad and the speaker so that my ears don't touch the insides.  Cups don't completely fit around the whold ear so my ears get sore a while from being squished."
868,0,"I thought this was a really good switch. It had all the good features for a pretty reasonable price and it runs at gigabyte speed. I bought mine in Feb. 2007 and in Aug. it quit. They sent me a brand new unit and then that one quit in Nov. I am now waiting for my second replacement unit.I have to say that Netgear's customer care people are quite co-operative and they replace their defective products right away without an argument. But I have to wonder what it going on with this product. If this third unit quits, I think I'll just find another switch and call it even.The irony of it is that this thing replaced a really cheap plastic Netgear 4-port switch that I bought at a store for $10. That switch has lasted quite a few years -- in fact I'm running on it now. It works perfectly.PS: If you've done much research, you know that the gs108 has a lot of features that the other switches in this price category lack. My advice is to first find out if Netgear has fixed the problem I refer to and, if you can satisfy yourself that they have, go ahead and buy it.ADDED Sep. 5, 2009: The thing died on me. I don't know how they can keep replacing these under warranty with the same unit that has the same problem. Threw this unit in the trash and bought a D-Link."
869,1,"I'll get one thing out of the way. I bought this camera mainly because it looked cool. I was shopping for a digital camera in an electronics market (I live in Asia) and was looking for something in the 2.0 megapixel range. I ran across the CoolPix 2500 and the design of it definitely caught my eye. I looked at it for a while, toyed around and decided I wanted to buy it. While it's definitely a good camera, it's not the best.On the whole, I thought this camera was pretty good. One thing that sets the Nikon CoolPix line of cameras apart from everything else is its swivel lens design. This is clever because when you're not using it, it covers the lens. No need to worry about broken lens covers or scratched lenses anymore. Plus it helps getting angled shots much easier. No more craning your neck to get a shot above of below you, just tilt the lens. It's a whole lot more useful than you'd think.The picture quality of this in general is pretty good. The colors come out accurately and the pictures are clear. However, the night exposure could be better, although it's good enough to pass without any qualms. A big problem that's related to night time shots however is red eye. It's always there and it never seems to go away. I managed to minimize it using the different scene settings, but it just never completely leaves. It gets sort of annoying after a while, but it's something most people can live with.Also, the camera tends to feel on the fragile side. Whenever I put it in my pocket, I always feel like it's going to break any second. Of course it's never happened and I realize that it'll take quite a bit to knock it out of commission, but it does have that light easily breakable feeling that I can never seem to shrug off.Some other minor complaints is that there is no video output straight to a TV and there is no optical viewfinder, although the optical viewfinder part isn't really too big of a problem. Also, there is no protection for the LCD screen. Something along the lines of what Sony does with their cameras would have been a good protective measure to take with the screen.With all these negative aspects to it, you would think that I wouldn't like it, but that isn't the case. It still is a good camera and it's a blast to use. The visual quality is still fairly good and has a bunch of nifty features to it, namely the swivel lens. And besides, whenever you pull it out in front of other people and you swing the lens, everyone will go ""ooohhhhhh."""
870,0,"I foolishly purchased this router a year ago when it was on sale with a mail in rebate. To this day I regret the decision.Basically, the device is a piece of junk. The wireless signal strength is terrible and won't work past 2 rooms. Furthermore, the router will shut down its wireless component every 1.5 days so that you have to manually reboot the thing to get it working again. No amount of upgrading the firmware helped. Netgear support was completely useless.If you are looking for a wireless router, buy the Linksys WRT54G/GS and then go to [...] to install their custom firmware. You will have a $50 router with enough functions built-in (QoS, custom firewall, etc.) to rival business class products five times its cost."
871,1,"According to our sales man, this camera was rated by Consumer Reports as the Number 1 Camera under $....  Two weeks after purchasing it, I failed to see why.  The limited 2 Megapixels DO make a difference, especially when printing regardless of size.Features I liked: Nightime flash was wonderful!  Looked like photos were taken during the day.  Very lightweight (although almost seemed flimsy).  Superior Lens Quality.  Picture Size: even high quality photos were not huge in bytes on the computer.Features I did not like: Cannot View Photos (or even last photo taken) without shutting camera.  Prolonged time from taking of one photo to next (I am talking 20-40 seconds! a lot when you see a photo you like).  Often ""closed"" the front panel when grabbing camera from someone to take a photo, in turn shutting it off.  Red Eye feature: everyone always blinked after it.In the end, I exchanged it for the D-550 which was much worse (stay away!) and finally got the Sony CyberShots."
872,0,This was a decent unit when it was new.  I used one for years but when Comcast got above 7 meg (now 22) this could not perform above 7.  Don't buy if you have more than 7 meg as this will be the weak link in your chain.  I upgraded to the FVS318G 4 years ago and that is a big improvement but limited to 22 MEG.  Its time for a new upgrade.
873,0,"This router worked ok for about a month and then failed when I was in the admin page.Still kinda works, but I can no longer get into the admin page, and it takes forever to boot the router. I tried resetting it to factory defaults, but it doesnt respond to the switch.I was happy with it when it worked, but it failed too fast to be satisfactory. I went and bought another one however."
874,1,"I purchased this wire but had the wrong banana plugs for the wire. I initially cursed the wire, but the plugs I selected just werent friendly with this gauge of wire. I'm sure it works just fine but with different banana plugs than I purchased."
875,2,"While the whole package is a bit bulky, the eTrex device seems more protected and easier to grip and hold securely."
876,0,"While easy to set up, and otherwise works fine, as a router it leaves something to be desired.  I cannot maintain a persistent connection either in or out via this router.  If I login to any of my usual working computers using ssh, the connection is dropped and timed out after a few minutes, meaning I have to login again on another shell.  This is not an intermittent problem, as when one connection dies, I can immediately open another shell and ping the device or log in again - it just drops the connection.I also plugged my old non-wifi SMC Barricade back in and had none  of these problems, so I know it isn't me.I tried to email customer service and got no reply.  I called customer service and got a fellow who didn't know what ssh is, and whose only solution was to reload the driver from the (very slow) website.So I'm returning this device and getting something else.  Probably a wifi SMC Barricade."
877,2,"I used many of them and painted them. they work great and look good but be carefull about installing them to make sure they are in the right place, because if you want a slight modification in position you will take all the paint off. great product."
878,0,"How can such a simple item be so badly constructed?I bought this for my girlfriend, who was using an mp3 player with FM radio before. Since I noticed that she never used the mp3 -just the radio- when that gadget became malfunctional, I decided that a radio-only device would be just fine. There aren't many options here in Amazon, this one is almost one out of two portable digital radio-only devices. First I was surprised at its bulky size (check this if you plan to buy it anyway) I expected it to be no bigger than the mp3, but this is LARGE. Well -I said to myself- with such size it surely has better quality. Hell no! I couldn't syntonize one single station without hearing a loud ""zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"" of interference. The old mp3 with FM had much better sound..."
879,0,"I used to be such a big D-Link fan, but they quickly lost a loyal customer in the last 2 months.  The DI-614+ is [so weak].  I keep getting packet loss on the wired LAN side, Windows XP would complain for a brief moment that the network connection is offline, and of course the matching LED on the router would go off too.  Wireless part is even worse.  Packet loss, random reboot loop, you name it, it does... This is my last D-Link product."
880,0,"This product comes with a CD called ""Resource CD Version 3.3"".  The following words are printed on the CD package....""Setup for Apple Mac and Linux Users"" and then ""Insert the CD, open index.htm and chose your language.  Click Mac Installation Guide for Mac users and Setup Manual for all others.""However THERE IS NO MAC INSTALLATION GUIDE.  I called Netgear Technical Support and was told that I had to download a firmware update from the Netgear website and then download it to the router.  I looked at the page....[...]The Netgear Technical Support person refused to answer my question as to why the information printed on the Resource CD packaging was incorrect.  The Netgear Technical Support person also seemed to have no idea what an iMac was, or that an iMac does not have a Microsoft Operating System.  After looking at the Firmware Update page, I tried calling Netgear Technical Support again to ask some questions about the Firmware Update process, but I got tired of waiting after around ten minutes.I hung up, and printed out the Amazon return labels.  This is the first time that I have ever returned anything to Amazon and the last time that I am buying a Netgear product."
881,2,"This is a surprisingly useful gadget, as it serves as an extension cord and volume control. The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone, which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer. The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player."
882,0,"I don't know if a FOOL would buy a product from a company that has no support.  I tried 330-405-8616 for 35 days--inoperative.  I sent emails through the One-4-All website--no response.  I was shunted among several Audiovox corporate phone queues--62 minutes worth of ""Your call is very important to us.""  I don't know if a FOOL would buy a product from a company that does not support its products."
883,0,"These produce good sound quality for the price (when they were $40)..however I do not think they are worth $80 that they are asking for now. The problems I had with this set was:a) they fall off very easily and it became increasingly frustrating when leaning over to pick up weights or anything that requires up and down movements. This problem gets worse and worse the longer they are in use.b) the cord is thin and fragile, about 10 months in the cord started to tear from the plug I had to bend it and use electric tape to keep it secure.Ultimately I stopped using these because of the mentioned problems and instead rely on my Sennheiser HD495s and Bose Around The Ear head phones, both which have a better designed cord (both can unplug from the head phones so you can easily replace the plug) and neither falls off my head.You can get roughly the same sound quality for cheaper by buying the Koss KSC75s or Portapros. I can't believe they are charging this much for such a cheaply constructed product."
884,2,"PROS: Vivid colors, astonishing picture quality and details, great design and ergonomics, USB connectionCONS: Battery drains fast, bad focus in low-light conditionsKodak's DC4800 gives you easy access to manual functions, offers a direct USB connection to download photos to desktop and notebook, more sturdy than other cheap cameras, accurate colors that rivals film cameras. Having access to higher resolutions (such as 3.1 mega pixels) is is important as well, b/c you want your picture to be sharp and crisp.Ergonomics are great and your hands will feel at home when using it!  The casing feels very solid, but the two plastic doors (for connectivity and the memory card) looks like they could break at any time.Here are the functions accessible manually:  - Self-timer: to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself.  - Burst mode: to take 4 pictures in sequence (at the lowest picture quality, you can take up to 16).  - Landscape: to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus.  - Close-up: To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0.7-2.3 feet in great details.  - Flash and flash settings: Will let you chose between flash, no flash, red-eye  - Exposure compensation (from -2 to +2): This will let you chose to over- or underexpose your subject, to adapt to various light conditions.  - Aperture (f/8, f/5.6, f/2.8): You can decide on the depth of field, so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos. You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over.  - Zoom in/out: You get a 3x physical zoom, and also a 2x digital (which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough). You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode, to prevent yourself from using it (I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom... they're always grainy, not only with the Kodak's digital zoom, but with all those I tried).The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card, which is a complete nonsense for a 3.1 mega pixels camera. You should buy at least 64 MB. Amazon has great prices on this.The BAD part of the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low-light conditions. It rarely focuses on the subject but looks for any source of light and focus at that point.The main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery.Kodak's proprietary Li-Ion battery that's used in the DC4800 doesn't impress at all. With the LCD on, it doesn't last more than 40 pictures, after which the LCD turns itself off. Get a charger and solve your problems.ALL digital cameras have their shortfalls, but this one has the least. It's simply amazing when you consider the price!"
885,1,"Doesn't fit well on my visor, and the straps seem to get stretched out enough to make it fall down regularly."
886,0,"I had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338.  The main reason is the speed.  I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318's at 1.2Mbps!  This is unacceptable.  Oh yes, this is with the latest firmware.Several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem.  I contacted their legal deptartment the same day.  Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS!I have successfully sued to get my money back.With all of my venting done, I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it.  But Netgear be warned, I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported."
887,2,Works great.  Can't say much else about this product other than write filler words so I can hit the submit button (got it).
888,2,I like good quality in the ear speakers but not all of them have the volume control on the wire leads. I bought a set of Klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control. Having the inline control is a must for me because I wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club I belong to. So with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs I need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when  someone is trying to talk to me. They work well and I cannot hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control. I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control device.
889,1,"I'm a singer and guitar player, and use these for feedback during recording sessions ... very high quality sound at a very good price.After about a month, I'm still quite happy with the ""bang per buck"" factor, these are professional quality, at a reasonable price.  My only complaint is the cord ... they have a coiled cord (like a heavy version of the old telephone cords), and it's only about 3 feet long un-stretched, which means you are very quickly to the point where you are tugging against the coils with the left earpiece, where the cord connects.  I wish they just had a simple long straight cord instead."
890,2,"I keep hearing about this little headphone that I just had to try it.  When the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone, I jumped on it.There are countless reviews here describing about PortaPro.  So I will skip most of things mentioned here.  I will just focus on my experience with it.First of all, Koss was not a known brand for me.  Only time I really saw their product was when I went to Thrifty (now Rite Aid) and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section.  Naturally, I always thought they just make cheap quality products.  In last year or so, I started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality.  And this product kept popping up in reviews and people's recommendations.  I was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since it's launch in the mid 80's.For $25-$35 price range headphone, I am not so sure if there are better headphones.  It sounds just amazing.  Very full and rich low and mid sound (not muddled but clear and balanced).  Highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound range.Build quality is just average.  I don't mean it's badly assembled or anything like that.  But even by mid 80's standard, parts used are extremely minimalistic.  Some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position.  Basically, it is not designed to ""lock"" into one position.  If you take your headphone off, you will have to readjust the length of the metal band.Another bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing.  But I think once you hear the sound quality, you won't mind wearing it.Again, for the price, I don't think you can beat it.*Update:  I LOVE THIS HEADPHONE!  :)"
891,0,"I bought this product for a 13"" notebook. I could see virtually no improvement in the heat reduction performance of the 2 fans. I was disappointed with the lack of quality in this product and turned off by its design and cheap plastic appearance. It did not appear to be constructed with any lasting longevity in mind. On that note, I promptly returned it for a refund, and purchased an aluminum frame Cool Master Note Pal. It has definately cooled down my computer and has been a good choice."
892,1,"I got this back in 2009 and it's still working for me, but I'm currently looking for a better alternative of OTA digital TV. The unit is still holding up and still works. This unit requires to be plugged into work, even in the ""bypass"" option, but works okay, it just requires a lot of patience and tinkering to get the max channels. With the amplifier on and the manual tinkering with the amplifier it takes quite a bit of time to get the max out of this little guy.The rabbit ears have gotten a little lose from the constant repositioning, but that's just normal wear-and-tear. The coaxial cable is short it requires and extension, female-female adapter, and some wall fittings for the coaxial extensions.This product is very sensitive to nearby electronic devices and movement/positioning of any sort. The power cable is also very short so make sure you have an extension cord or a nearby outlet.I'm able to get the following channels (22 of 29+ channels according to anntennaweb.org)7; 8-1-2; 10-1-2-15; 12-1 (weak signal); 15-1-2; 17-1-2; 27; 33-1-2 (ws); 35; 36-1-2; 39-1-2; 49-1-2 (ws); 51-1; 69-1-2-3"
893,1,"I'm not sure if it's just overly sensitive or it just likes going off at random sometimes.  I first set it up on the side of the house, facing across the driveway.  But every time our neighbor walked to his car, it went off... even 15 feet away through thick cedar bushes.  So I moved it onto a tree facing the house at a 45 degree angle.  Everything seemed to set it off.  So then I put it against the house further up the driveway where it couldn't pick up the neighbor.  It seems to work good for awhile, then for no particular reason it will start going off at 3am one or two times.  It's too high off the ground to pick up small animals; in testing it there, it only goes off for people or vehicles.  Very annoying, we end up shutting it off."
894,2,This is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcr's are now few and far between.This item is almost non-existent in stores.It does the job it was made for.You can't ask for anything more.
895,1,"Whistler is a respected vendor in the radar detector market. This is a model that won a few awards when it was first introduced in 2002. The low price is because it is being closed out, although you can still find it available online in the 60-100 dollar range.I don't think you can find a better detector for under 100 dollars, so unless you are willing to spend 150 or more this is a good entry-level model with the following features:* A digital compass* High-visibility text* Loud audio alerts* Highway and dual city modes* Quiet and auto-quiet modes* All BandTM protection including VG-2 which will conceal your detector from police* Battery saver that automatically shuts off your detector if you forgetBe aware that this model does not detect or offer protection against the most up to date POP technology, but if you want it be prepared to spend 3-4 times more."
896,2,"These are a better way of securing cables than using a wire twister, The different colours can be used to identify cables and are reusable. Would like to see pacs of various sizes."
897,2,"This little remote is a good product and a must for self- and self-family protraiture. I found the shutter release options very handy. Very small and easy to carry around (in your shirt pocket if you wanted to). The caveats (and hence why four stars): you MUST be in front of the camera (or at least the remote). The small size though practical in some respects it also presents a problem since it's fairly easy to misplace. Trust me when you carry around $3-4K worth of equiment or when you're doing paid work, the least your mind is thinking about is this little remote. Thugh for the price it's OK to lose it, I suppose. But in conclusion, I think this is nice product at a fair price."
898,0,"I needed a travel set of headphones, so the reviews convinced me to try these. OK, not so good! I travel with a Zen V+ MP3 (and a CMoy Amplifier for times when the background noise is too much to overcome otherwise). The earbuds that came with the Zen (I'll bet, not top-of-the-line) compare well to the PX 100's. I found the PX 100 unconfortable to wear, even for a few minutes (but maybe my head is on wrong, or something). I've decided to travel with my (very) old Sony V6's -- large, but totally confortable and incomparable better sound than the PX 100. I guess I'd say the the V6's have a ""transparency"" of the sound--an impression of life, presence, vitality--rather than the impression of distance and flattness in a foggy day that I get from the PX 100's.I don't write a lot of review, and most of the ones I write are negative (although I buy-buy-buy from the internet) to help other avoid my mistakes. This was one of my mistakes. Generally, Sennheisser's are expensive, upper-end. Maybe I should have suspected that the price of the PX 100's reflected the quality and effort put into them.One thing I have not tried is the ""ear canal"" buds. I'm not a purist audiophile, simply someone who enjoys music listening (mostly popular, w/ some classical thrown in)."
899,2,"This bag is great! It has many compartments for batteries, memory cards, and whatnot. Its well made and very sturdy! It also comes with different straps to use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because for one, its a little bulky to carry around. And two, every time I want to put my camera away for a little while I have to take it apart to put it in the bag. I know for some that's not that big of a problem, but I'm running around taking pictures and then when I have a 30 minute break before the next team goes on, I don't want my camera hanging around my neck. So I have to take my camera apart to put it away, zip the bag up, then hook it, all in a crowded place. So for me it just gets a little redundant after a while. But for some this product may be perfect!"
900,2,Simply the best inexpensive headphone on the market. Hard to believe they first appeared 20+ years ago and they still can't be beat.
901,0,great idea...poor build.it lasted 2 months and then died...
902,0,"I ordered this cable and when I used it (instead of the other Radio Shack cable I own) it produced washed out, incomplete audio and constant hum from the subwoofer of my Klipsch IFI system. So it was 5 bucks down the tubes. Maybe it was a fluke. You be the judge."
903,2,"The case is well made and functions as described. The plastic screen protector makes reading my GPS a little more difficult. Also, the side buttons on the eTrex are not easily accessible with this case. I end up taking the GPS out of the case when I'm using it frequently. It's great to keep your GPS looking new and for packing it away."
904,2,"These earbuds are the solution to all of your travel needs. Lets face it, public or commercial transportation is not known for its quiet atmosphere. I'm sure you will agree that you are always trying to raise the volume high enough to drown out the background noise, but the headphones just can't do it. The Koss Plug is the answer.I spent 20 years in the Air Force and I have gone through three sets of these. These are the only headphones that I could use while riding on military cargo planes without wearing ear plugs and without cranking the volume to max. Ever time I thought I found something better, they never could reach the level of noise isolation that the Koss Plugs provide. The bass level is superior to every budget or midrange priced similar devices. If you don't mind wearing ear plugs, these are perfect for you. If you don't like wearing ear plugs, get over it; these plugs are worth the the annoyance."
905,2,"These are great headphones for the money.  I wish the cord was a little longer as I use them at my desk.  The sound is far better than I've found with others in this price range, so it's a reasonable trade-off for me.  The lifetime guarantee doesn't hurt, either."
906,2,"The cable is thin, but appears to be a high quality. Connectors are well built.The volume control is easy to use, and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volume."
907,2,This is one of the good one all the good capabilities and a very good price for this radio as good and a better price. Very effective mike control.
908,0,I wanted to connect my cable box hdmi out to my 'vga input only' aoc monitor.it did not work.
909,0,"These speakers aren't bad sounding, they just are not great speakers. They sound best at low volume. They sound good at less than 10 watts, but not so great above that. Bass is weak from these units.If you want good Bose sound at least go with the 301's.I got rid of the 201's and replaced them with Sony SS-B3000's which have better bass response and simply sound much better at less than half the price."
910,1,"I've had this unit for about 8 months.  I've had very few problems with dvd skipping or anything like that.  My VCR portion works fine.  But recently, I've been having a problem with this thing actually reading dvd's.  It stopped reading dvd's a few weeks ago.  However, since I was still under the manufacturer's 1 year warranty, I called Samsung, and they gladly offered to replace/fix my broken unit in less than 14 days upon them receiving my current one.  According to UPS, I'm supposed to be getting it in tomorrow....let's hope it works!"
911,1,"I tested in immediately after its arrival, played eagles Hotel California, the bass is of bad quality, laud and boomy. This is not a high fidelity headphone as some reviewer claimed, but is what you should expect for $15. I guess it would be a nice set of head-phone for children."
912,0,I was able to get it working occasionally on a Windows 8 computer - many reviews had said it would work fine.  I didn't find that to be true.  I am returning the product.
913,0,"There is no current driver for this keyboard, buyer beware. I contacted the manufacturer and they confirmed this fact. This product is of no use to me whatsoever."
914,2,"Now these are not balanced to start with, more boost in the muddy area (200hz-300hz). But with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good. They rival even my Sony MDR-7509HDs when this cut is applied. I also have an communications headset from Koss, SB-49 for $50, which I've used for gaming AND mixing audio. Koss just makes great sounding gear, but pay for the high end stuff to get out-of-the-box balanced."
915,2,"I read a couple reviews that urged me to buy ONLY a new Midland 75-822, but being thrifty I decided to buy an Amazon return product.MISTAKE!! FAIL!!I know you can save money buying refurb, but in this case my refurbed radio was missing the key part: the mobile assembly adapter (i.e. car power/antenna adapter). So, while I could use it at home, it was worthless in the car!I will update my review after I receive the NEW one I just ordered. My suggestion if you buy this (and the product is well regarded):BUY NEW...AND ONLY NEW...IF YOU IGNORE THIS WARNING, BE SURE YOU CHECK FOR ALL THE PARTS AND RETURN IF YOU DON'T GET THEM. I read about so many people that say, ""Well, it was missing so and so, but I just kept it anyway."" NO!Just my 2 cents.BUY NEW!!Update July 2012: I did return the original used radio and bought new. This is a really nice product and I have revised my review to 5 stars.I got this for backup communications in the event cell towers go down (natural or man-made disasters) and I fully believe it will serve wonderfully in that capacity. Just be sure to practice a bit with it and become proficient before you really need it."
916,0,"This Netgear MR814V3 (meaning version 3) router has so thoroughly messed up my network, it's just unbelievable. I tried to replace an old Apple Airport base station with this router. I have a Dell with a Microsoft USB Wi-Fi adapter, an iMac with an old Airport card, and they all worked fine with my old Airport base station, but I wanted some more ethernet ports. I hooked up the Netgear and everything went to pot! After fiddling and fiddling, I got the Dell to talk to it wirelessly and the iMac to work on one of the Netgear's ethernet ports, it wouldn't work on the Wi-Fi at all. But that's not what I wanted, and the thing kept dropping the connection. I emailed Netgear's customer support, and guess what they said! They would be happy to help me if I would pay them $30!!! It seems there is some fine print INSIDE THE BOX, that says support is only free if my whole network is Netgear equipment. The box says ""24/7 Technical Support"" on the outside. OK, so I am only paying $20 for this thing, it is now unreturnable, I give up. I put the Airport back into my network, I pulled the Netgear out and tried to put my network back like it was. No soap! My iMac can't seem to find the Airport base station and the Dell periodically drops the connection. This Netgear thing has screwed up my whole system! Wow! I guess I'm on my way to the Apple store to get a new Airport, instead. I hope they can give me some clues on how to fix the iMac's Airport card.Unless you have an all Netgear system, DO NOT buy this (or any other) piece of Netgear equipment."
917,0,I purchased two of these. Neither of them worked with any usb device I tried and I tried several. Don't purchase.
918,2,"They work just as advertised, and are in fact 14 inches long. They are secure enough for my purposes and easily trimmed to length after &#34;zipped.&#34;"
919,0,"If I could give 2.5 stars, I would.First of all, it's outrageous for Bose to claim that they have ""high quality"" parts and assembly when they charge $300 for speakers that aren't even magnetically shielded.The claim is that these are great for your home system, but you have to keep it 2+ feet away from your TV and other electronics because of the magnetism. Otherwise, your TV will be spewing funny colors on the sides until it's degaussed, and your computer or console systems might start losing data - or not work altogether.Second of all, just look at the construction; glued together slabs of plywood (actually, I think it's particle board but I'm no pro) in the back, with those cheap wire connectors. If you pay a little bit of attention to detail, you'll see cost-cutting measures from many angles.There's a quote for something like this: ""Nice from afar, but far from nice.""At this price, it's embarrassing.The sound:I used these with my home theater system for years.  From day one I never felt satisfied. I thought I wasn't setting them up right because everyone talks so lovingly about Bose. But no. They never sounded that good.I tried many methods: keep it away from the walls, for better ""wide dispersal"" of sound. I put them close to the wall, then slightly farther and farther. I tried placing them in corners of the room at different distances. While some setups were marginally better than others, I never once was satisfied with the end result.Bass is floppy when it comes to something more than a typical single-note beat (think of a techno bassline). It just kind of flutters all over the place. The mids are decent, but the treble kind of fades away and is overwhelmed by the midrange.Directionality is nonexistent. First thing I noticed when I got my new speakers was how I could tell how FAR an object crashed offscreen, and WHERE it would be if it landed in my room. That never happened with these speakers. Everything is ""there"", but resides ""nowhere"".I had to blast up my center channel volume in order to be ""somewhat content"" with my sound system. I've replaced all my Bose products and am never going back.There is a place for these speakers:I donated the 301Vs to a friend of mine that owns a bar. He was using the Logitech Z5500 speakers to play music... in a room that was 10x larger than the speakers were meant to fill.I put these on the shelf, and included a PolkAudio CS10 for the center speaker - and the sound filled up the room MUCH more nicely. It was a great improvement!Best of all, the speakers are on high shelves away from other electronics. WIN/WIN!THE POSITIVE (and there are good things about these speakers):Here's the ""best"" aspect of the 301Vs... they are actually good to have for a large room in which you could be sitting in many different places. If it's a mid-sized bar - and they are wired at the far right and far left of the room - it does a good job making everything ""balanced"". The lack of directionality from these speakers is an attribute when there are a wide range of seating options. There are few - if any - ""dead spots"" in the bar. Plus, the passable midrange and low treble keeps it easy to maintain a conversation while still having music on.  Wherever someone sits, they won't be yelling over the volume compared to another spot in the bar.So for that, I give them props. With that said, I do not recommend these for home theater use, or for music at home if you like a properly dispersed sound field.I'd recommend them for about $150, but you can find better at this price range. In fact, almost anything for $300 would be better."
920,0,"**Update  - Only thing I have to add is that if you have plenty of power and an EQ these phones actually sound great!  The bass comes to life if you have more power, but I wouldn't have found this out had I not hooked them into my home stereo (these are marketed as portable headphones so I bought them for my mp3 player).  If you have access to an EQ, then pump up the bass and midrange!-------------These are by far the best quality portable headphones I've owned.  The amount of amenities they've packed in is great:Portability - 10Fit and Finish - 10Weight - 10Style - 10Comfort - 8.5 (great faux leather ear pads and head pad)Now on to the less important stuff.Treble - 7 (Very high)Mid - 3 (Could be better but can't hear because of the Treble)Bass - 1  (I thought I was hearing bass, but it was only my toe tapping)These are the worst sounding headphones I own.  My $22 JVC HA-CD71Fs I own blow the socks off these, as do my $8 RCA replacements.Where the two previously mentioned headphones lacked in quality (I mean really lacked) these lack in sound (I mean really lack).This headphone should cost half what they ask.And a note to all the reviewers (%80 of them).  If the only thing you are comparing these too is earbuds then you're, frankly, not that bright (I wanted to say something else here).  ANY HEADPHONE WILL SOUND BETTER THAN AN EARBUD.Now excuse me while I throw on my cracked, taped-up, ear-foam-falling-off, GREAT-SOUNDING JVC $22 headphones."
921,2,"Works as advertised with my XSi (450D).  It was a lot smaller than I expected, about the length and width of my thumb.  It's so light weight I'd say that it's about the same as a ballpoint pen.  It comes with a holder/base that can be threaded onto a 3/8 inch strap so you don't lose the small item.  The clip that secures the remote to the base feels flimsy due to the light weight, but there are not any gaps which may snag an errant object.  In agreement with the other reviews, the toggle between off/instant/delay is very small and definitely not accessible to fat fingers or gloves.  One other thing, you'll need to stand to the right of the frame to point the remote at the IR receiver.  Standing on the left, sometimes the lens will block the line of sight.  Similarly if you're tilting the camera on a tripod, sometimes the IR receiver won't be in your line of sight.  However, compared to the cost of an wireless setup, which cost about 80 dollars more, this device is cost effective despite the deficiencies mentioned.My decision came down to this product versus the Opteka RC-4.  The difference was only 10 dollars, so I splurged.  However, only 4 stars because the thing feels so flimsy and the aforementioned limitations."
922,2,"Its a nice little tool but you cannot do movements for video work .what i mean is the tripod's head is very basic and camera movements are not easily obtained .other wise the mini tripod is great for its purpose .Its  durable and can hold your digital slr with big lenses with no problem at all .I got it for my t2i , it is perfect for the low angle shooting , i use it only for video work .there is a major missing element and that is the balance indicator .you have to balance the camera visually ."
923,1,"In this case you get what you pay for. the wire is brittle and hard to manage without breaking but its usable .. If your on a budget this wire will work, however im not sure as to the ""life"" of it. meaning i doubt it will hold up for any length of time.. If your Installing a high dollar system chances are you wont be reading this but if you are dont waste your time spend the few extra bucks."
924,2,"Great little gadget for keeping the camera super steady and tripping it remotely. Like the other reviews say, the cord is a little short, but other than that it works great!"
925,1,"Great sound, but I didn't realize these grip the head so tightly when I ordered them online. Or maybe I just have a big skull?"
926,0,"I've used these discs for both standard PC data media (burnt ISOs for backups and general data), for CD/Redbook audio, and for some grey-market consoles (select people will know what I mean by this.  :) )Out of a 50 pack, I ended up with about 6 coasters.  Not horrible, but not great either.These discs have a tendancy to be ""noisy"" when read from -- the thickness and size of the discs, despite being standard, must be off by a slight margin since they end up rattling around inside of drives at higher speeds (32x+).  Other vendor's discs don't seem to do this.These discs do not perform very well under high speed operations (32x+) either; lots and lots of media re-reads.  Again, other vendor's discs seem to perform OK.But the worst part, in my opinion, is that there's no writing surface on the label side of the disc!  It's almost completely (99%) black.  How are you supposed to write on the disc what the contents are?!  Oh right, there's a 1cm strip along the edge of the CD (curved none the less) where you can write.  Thus you're forced to buy stickers that go on the disc (which end up making the discs unbalanced in weight, thus making even more noise than mentioned above).I'd have given these discs 3 stars had the quality been better, but the lack-of area to write on is appalling.  I really don't know what Memorex was thinking."
927,2,"This is my second JVC CD changer, I gave the first one I purchased five years ago to my mother and it's still working like a champ. This player has  excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are  well laid out. The disk exchange feature is nice, you can leave one disk  playing while you swap the others. The only  downside to this player is on  the programming, you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered,  doing so stops the program and you have to start over again. This is mostly  annoying when you are recording to MD or tape and realize that you have  forgotten a song."
928,0,"Connected to Linksys E3000 router. NO GIGABIT connection.  wth.  works at 100mbps. but it's for the living room, and maxes out.  idea was to have a gigabit link to the computer room.  NOT worth the extra $ from a Fast Ethernet switch."
929,1,"The headphones have nice audio quality, are comfortable to wear, but the isolation from room noise is only so-so; it seems that comfort and noise suppression are mutually exclusive. I do like the heavy, single cord. But at $100, these headphones are not a great value."
930,0,"This is binocular melded with a very low end submegapixel digital camera.I can't even rate the optical portion high, because it was very uncomfortable to use.  The spacing and spacing adjustments between the barrels are awkward.  My nose has to rest on the USB port entry to be able to see into the lenses.The camera automatically shuts off in less than 60 seconds, sometimes not enough time to line up a shot.  When the shutter engages, it beeps once, but it beeps twice more before shut off, forcing me to look at the camera to ensure I didn't hit the shutter again.The worst part, is my 10X digital camera opticals gets a tighter closeup than the binocular."
931,0,"Windows Vista doesn't completely recognize the device when you plug it in, and while it then recognized my Bluetooth headset it would not communicate with the headset at all. When I tried installing the software from the included CDROM, Vista blocked the installation as incompatible, and Vista sent me to a TOSHIBA website! Oops. The drivers which were installed show up in Device Manager as Toshiba drivers, not DLink.Toshiba absolutely refuses to talk to me about it, and DLink says it will not work with Vista and I should return it for a refund.DLink has NO PLANS TO SUPPORT VISTA. They don't have drivers, they say they're not working on drivers, and they say there is no schedule under which they intend to ship drivers. (OK, all of that was said by someone in India, and who knows if they know actual DLink policy.)Others have said this product works with Vista. Well, in my case (a new HP Media Center PC), not only does the software fail to install, it modifies my desktop and screws things up bad enough that I had to use System Restore to back up to a checkpoint. Nice feature of Vista... checkpoints are automatically created often enough that you don't have to remember to make one before installing.Lesson learned. If their website says ""XP SP2 or higher"", that means it only works on XP. Nowhere else. Now I wonder if Amazon will take it back?"
932,0,"I purchased this and the USB PLUSB10 to set up a home powerline network. Plain and simply, it sucked. Everything else I have is Linksys (router, wireless B and wireless B+G). I had no problem working the listed items together and wanted to add Powerline. The Powerline items couldn't see each other and the setup instructions didn't tell you what components you needed to make the system work. I bought the NetGear Powerline products. They arrived and worked fine with full instructions. I'd go NetGear in this case..."
933,2,Sound quality is excellent for the price and it is very easy to use; I highly recommend this player.
934,0,"I have had two DLink routers and both have died from overheating.  I use my router every day, about 3-5 hours altogether, only doing normal web surfing and minimal to moderate downloading.  The first router completely failed, had lasted about 2 years so I thought it had a good run.  Bought another Dlink, because hey they *are* cheap.  It's been a little over a year and the thing is overheating just like the first one.  You can feel the heat just rising off the cheap plastic box.  It works intermittenly and will probably fail completely soon.  Besides spending money twice on something that died so easily, I had ALWAYS had trouble with the advanced features such as opening up ports and even using the DMZ feature.  I could never get my router to open up correctly to outside traffic.  I'm going to go with a Linksys, hoping it will last me a little longer and will perform more reliably."
935,1,"The 70-300 G is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to 300 mm, but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag.  I've found my lens to be pretty soft throughout the zoom range (mine is soft even stopped down) and relatively slow to focus (D70).  The lens performs best in well lit environments and is capable of taking high quality pictures, but may require more post processing and effort than faster lenses to achieve these results.I bought the lens mainly to get the zoom range at an affordable price, but plan to replace it in the near future (probably will sell the lens).  The build quality isn't the best, but it is still pretty durable.  Recommended for beginning photographers or photographers on a budget (like myself), but others may be left wanting more.  Still, it is sold at a great price."
936,2,For the price you pay these are pretty good headphones.  Fit better than most in your ears and last FOREVER.  Not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfect.
937,1,"This is a great PDA! Elegant design, fast, practical, the best among all models before Tungsten. The best value for your money, as well. I used to have a Palm VIIx, another great PDA, but I decided to switch to this model mostly because of the, supposedly better, wireless capabilities (internet access, even Google!), AOL instant messenger, e-mail, etc., the amazing Documents To Go program, and also for the fabulous expansion card with the Merriam-Webster dictionary! I have only two (major) complaints: the wireless service is TOO expensive and the MultiMail 1.2 e-mail program takes longer than with the Palm VIIx, let alone it gobbles very quickly your monthly allotment of 100K. In less than a month, just using e-mail, it has already used up 163K! And to think that with my Palm VIIx, I barely used 40K each month... If the wireless service were less expensive and more efficient (there is a number of error messages each time) this Palm would be, hands down, the best of all. I will continue to enjoy my Palm i705 minus the wireless capabilities. I don't want to talk about the old fashioned, low-resolution screen, practically the same that came with the original Palm Pilot. The Casio Cli&eacute;, if not for the lack of wireless functions, beats easily this model. And this is said by a seasoned Palm fan."
938,1,"Ideal for DX, but not so good on FX.Normally, when you shoot wide angle, you're interested in the whole image sharpness and not only the center. This lens did not quite work out for me on my D700 because of the corner softness. I ended up replacing it with the new Nikon 14-24mm."
939,2,"I have always used wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes since I can remember, but I have found the Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner to work just fine. Generally, if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems. In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads. Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play pre-recorded budget tapes in your VCR. You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture, sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads, linear audio heads, rollers and guides. In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me, but I have found that this Maxell Dry Head Cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely. This Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.I have found that for best performance, it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your VHS player/recorder. This allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem. I have not had to use a wet cleaner in over 14 years now."
940,0,"I bought these headphones after hearing them at a Bose store in a shopping mall.  I hadn't had anything much to compare them to except earphones that come with portable players and they sound much better than that.  However, you can get the same or better sound from headphones that cost far less.  I recently bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones to take to the gym... They are also more comfortable.  The Bose Triports have a flimsy plastic headband which has broken three times in nine months.  Bose cheerfully replaced them each time but I now must use the headphones gingerly and after hearing the Sennheiser PX 100 I prefer to use the Sennheiser.  The Bose sound nice but you can get better value for your money elsewhere.  Bose did, however, introduce me to better sounding headphones.  I just wish I had done some comparison shopping before I plopped down my money for the Bose headphones."
941,0,"For receiving AM radio, this is actually worse than the small cheap antenna that was incuded with my new stereo receiver. Don't waste your money; go to the nearest hardware store,and buy a cheap long length of wire.Also is totally unusable if your Stereo Receiver scans for signals; the Terk AM Advantage is already so poor an antenna, it will never find signals in the first place."
942,1,"First the good: These headphones sound wonderful. I've used them to watch TV and play games on the computer. Sound quality is excellent, no complaints. The chord is also pretty long, around eight feet I'd guess...long enough to get from my TV to my bed. The overall construction is very high quality and they should last for a very long time. Sennheiser is a great company, and the quality of these headphones is excellent.Now the bad: Like some others have mentioned, they aren't the most comfortable headphones after an extended period of time. Here is why: The headphones are big enough to cover your ears...but they are not deep at all. What happens is the hard inside of the headphone (not the cushy padding surrounding it) ends up pressing on your ears. This is fine at first...but after about an hour it really starts to hurt.I can think of two situations that might make this better. If you have very small ears they might fit inside and not hit the hard inside. If you have very large ears, the cushy padding might rest on your ears instead of around them...keeping the hard inside away from your ears. I'd consider my ears of normal size, and my above ""ideas"" are probably wishful thinking.The only solution I've found is to wear a beanie during use. This provides a nice padding between my ear and the hard inside. Luckily it's cold right now, but during the summer this doesn't help much. :) Again, they sound great, but be wary of the comfort."
943,1,"The stands are really well built.  They are solid and heavy, able to hold a good sized speaker.  They are not universal though.  My Yamaha speakers did not fit.  I had to use different screws and add some nuts to make them fit right."
944,0,the headset is comfortable enough and fits and seems to work but I've had several people tell me that since replacing my old headset (the connector on the plug finally broke after 6 or 7 years) I've had several people complain that I sound faint on the phone.  I'm actually using it with a Panasonic phone too.  I think I'll be replacing it with a Plantronics.
945,2,I purchased these to go with ceiling speakers for a coffee shop.  They were a good combination and worked well together.
946,0,"Sound is poor at best, and they don't stay up in your ear, as a gym rat who wears a head band it it both disappointing but fixable with a head band."
947,1,"I bought this antenna (for the bedroom) because of its 45dB power more than anything else. I already had a Philips/Magnavox antenna (for the living room), which i believe is less powerful, but it actually performs less well than the Philips.The switch on back is unlabeled. I don't understand why someone would make a switch with no label. I know it's on when the power light is on, but there are 2 on modes: cable and air. The way it seems to work is the middle is on air. If it's off, that means signals can pass through, according to the manual. You can move practically every part of the antenna around, but i have to do it far too much for my taste.This price is the same as what i pad at Target. It's ok, but i bet a cheaper one would perform as well."
948,2,"I'm going to briefly describe my level of photography before I dive into this review to put this into context (if you don't care about context just skip to the next paragraph). I've been into photography for two years. During that time I've been ""bitten by the shutterbug"" as they say, and I've devoted myself to photography: pouring over dozens of books, thousands of articles, and countless images learning the art. I'm relatively new to strobist photography; I got an SB900 for Christmas and since then I've fallen in love with off-camera flash. This Vivitar 285 HV is my second flash unit. The camera I primarily use is a Nikon D300.REVIEW:It's clear this flash is from a different era (The instruction manual is Copyright 1985) . At one point in the instruction manual it says something the long the lines of ""try shooting a roll of film to experiment with this feature."" As such, there is no iTTL/eTTL. *GASP* You'll actually have to decide the proper exposure for yourself. As my technique improves and I gain more experience with off-camera flash, I noticed that I relied less and less on the SB900's TTL capabilities. I'd shoot manual at the camera and manual on the flash.As I said before, this flash is old, but it feels like a workhorse in your hands. With a solid build and sturdy mounts I've read reviews of people who have been using a Vivitar 285 HV for 15+ years and it keeps slugging away.The power of this cheap flash is incredibly powerful. I've done an experiment comparing the flash output of the SB900 to the Vivitar 285HV, and I must say I'm quite impressed (please see this link for the test: [...] )It's pretty clear that with the extra $300 you'd drop for an SB900 you're paying for the optical slave, and the fancy iTTL electronics. Buy this flash."
949,1,"TDK makes great tapes, but this tape really does not define them. There was no problem with them, but it is not impressive. It is no where near the BETTER TDK tapes and JVC tapes."
950,2,Useful and safe way to transport your gear.I would have bought one size bigger had I known how much gear I would accumulate to carry.A well made and fairly priced bag nonetheless.
951,0,"Nice design and good looking. (Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards...Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta..."
952,2,Many of my friends look at these headphones and wonder why I make such a big deal about them. They are not the most beautiful headphones to look at. But do they kick xxx when it comes to sound there are not another pair it this price range that even comes close .
953,1,"So I have had this device for over six months now, and it's a great toy, no questions.  Often used as a WMA player with a SanDisk SD card, though I haven't downloaded any games onto it yet (will I ever?), and PocketTV is nice to watch trailers on.I haven't had a PDA before.  Nor do I use M$ Outlook.  So most of the synchronization is useless for me.  It's good to keep tasks, and take notes (including some data on Pocket Excel).But... the battery life [is bad], and I have had repeated crashes and data loss (lost some notes I took down at a conference - UGH).  Have had to load PocketTV couple times.But my biggest gripe is the SD card.  I couldn't get the ActiveSync to work properly, and now it seems to run if I take the SanDisk SD card out.  Why on earth would SanDisk and Toshiba make their SD cards incompatible with each other?  Can you imagine if a Lite-On or Yamaha CD-RW refused to work with a Maxell or Imation CD-R/RW?I wonder if Toshiba fixed this problem with their later devices.  I just called TechSupport, and the guy very nicely said I had run out my 90-day S/W support, and the SD card and ActiveSync (d-uh!) came under S/W.  I am not paying ... for the call!  Anyway, it seems to work now, so...  Atleast Toshiba's TechSupport people are polite and nice even if Toshiba doesn't offer much of it (time-wise).  And their website seems to [be bad] as well... oh well...Maybe I should have stuck with the cheaper Palms... but toys for boys, and all that, y'know :)Avantgo is nice, but then... most of the stuff I could do on a cheaper Palm.  Don't know about WMA, though - but now I have a separate MP3/CD player.  Convergence is still far away..."

955,0,"I have had this charger for about 6 years.This is a fast charger. It has charged my batteries in 15-20 minutes. At least thats how long the charge would last until it said it was done.This is what this charger is intended to do, BUT...Charging batteries this fast is NOT good for the batteries.I was only getting about 7-10 photos with my camera before it was saying that the batteries were dead. I was blaming the camera for this, thinking there was a short or something.Turns out that it is NOT the camera but the charger. These batteries need longer charge times to cycle properly. They will eventually burn out the batteries.This charger is only good if you absolutly need somewhat charged batteries in a hurry.Otherwise get a longer charging system."
956,2,"Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money."
957,2,"The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that because the Coolpix has a built in lens (unlike SLR), any modification (tele/wide add on) will invariably degrade the quality of the picture in both sharpness and exposure.  That said, the Nikon fisheye is excellent in both sharpness and quality compared to my Tiffen wide angle lens.  There is obvious distortion at the picture edges and you will have to compensate for exposure by increasing EV about 1+. Also, it blocks the internal flash so you will need an external flash if flash is required."
958,0,"The main problem with this router is that the connection inexplicably drops.  When this happens, you have to go through some ridiculous ritual to try and get your signal back.  Sometimes unplugging the router for a few seconds does the trick.  Sometimes restarting your computer does it.  Sometimes disabling the wireless connection and reenabling it fixes the problem.  And other times, you have to waste 1-2 hours talking with technical support.  The online setup/admin screen is also difficult to use because the passwords keep resetting.  When this router is working without any hassles, it is a decent product.  But because of its lack of reliability, I honestly cannot recommend it.  The time wasted trying to reestablish a lost connection makes this purchase more trouble than it's worth."
959,0,"This little Hub works great. I do mean little. It fits almost anywhere so you do not have to give up a footprint on a desk. Mine hides behind the printer.I did not have to use the AC/DC plug.I have the ProBox and Seagate Freeagent 3TB USB 3.0 together on it and they work like a charm. No conflicts.USB 3.0 cord provided is short but depending on your setup that might not be a problem in my case the Hub acts like an extension cord.UPDATE: 01/20/14 When I ordered a second unit, to add to the first, it did not work for cascading. I returned that unit and ordered a third unit. Now, that unit does not work either. So from 5 stars to 1 star.D-Link customer service desperately needs some help. The site is a circle of automated customer service without any provision for email contact. Using the internet, I found the customer service email and they were less than helpful.On the other hand, Amazon customer service was exceptionally helpful and worked with me and came up with a plan that should solve the problem with a minimum of hassle. Thank You Amazon."
960,1,"I, too, find Microsoft's re-arrangment of the Ins/Del set of keys as well as the arrow keys unfathomable.  Hmm, maybe the geniuses at Sony designed this one. :)  In any case, this is a comfortable keyboard, and affordable, and I would continue using mine despite the stupid key placements.  The multimedia version if a little better, at least with the inverted T keys.  BTW the pro version is discontinued."
961,1,"Hi, this memory stick gave me no problems so far, but if I had to get picky, there is a noticable delay when writing the pictures to the memory stick. I used this stick on a Sony DSC P8. After taking a picture, the LCD screen would turn black for about 3-4 seconds, and it is probably writing to the memory stick during that time. I did not have this problem with the included Sony memory stick or the 256 Sony brand memory stick I bought. Reliable, but if you find this delay annoying, buy Sony."
962,1,"So-so for me.I would have given it 5 stars if I use it only for voice note. It does what it is supposed to, and it does it well.However, it didn't work well for my daughter's violin lesson. The idea was she records herself and/or her teacher, and later she plays along with the recorded thing for practice.The problem is, the recorded notes sound always a bit higher than originally played on the instrument. I guess the tape speed is faster when playing back than when recording, for some reason. Maybe you wouldn't notice at first, but as soon as you try to play along with the tape it becomes apparent.Probably I was hoping too much for an inexpensive microcasette recorder, though. I wouldn't blame the manufacturer."
963,0,"My (relatively cheap) stereo came with an AM radio antenae that plugged into the back.  The Terk AM Antenna has two wires, not a plug.  The instructions indicated by placing the antenna near my stereo I would get a benefit.  No such luck.  I do not know if it would have worked better had I been able to plug it in.  I returned it, but the postage to me and to return it was more than half the cost of the antenna."
964,0,"This may be a fine modem, but it requires proprietary drivers that are not available for Linux."
965,2,"I am having a lot of fun with this camera.  Takes great pictures, and I actually think the software supplied is pretty good for sorting and downloading the photos onto the computer--for actually tinkering with the photos, I use both Adope Photo Deluxe and Corel Photo-Paint. Couple of bugs with my unit explain the four stars:1) I cannot select all five resolutions--two intermediate settings are displayed, but the camera won't select them.  2)  The battery life indicator doesn't seem to work--it's displayed, but the Lithium batteries died without warning (after lots of use). The Movie feature is a fun gimmick.  So is the ability to plug directly into a T.V. to view the photos as a slide show. The camera is small, which makes it easy to take along.  Fits in a jacket pocket.  I like the lens cover, and the unit seems sturdy. I am looking forward to getting the USB reader in the mail.  Downloads with the serial port take too long. I bought this as my first digital camera.  I wanted the zoom, and I wanted a convenient size and 2 megapixels.  There were a few models that met these criteria, and the zoom on this Olympus (as well as the video feature) sold me on this one.  I am hoping that the two minor bugs described above are easily resolved."
966,0,"Another reviewer says this model has a write protect switch.  Where the write protect switch is on his model, mine just has a small hole.  I suspect that maybe some early models had a write protect switch, but the one I got today definitely does not.  (Lexar never claims this model has a write protect switch).The small whole exposes the circuit board, allowing dust, pocket lint, liquid, etc., inside.  (At least in principal....)  This is very annoying...I'd really like to have a write protect switch, and bought this because I thought that it had one.Otherwise it's nice so far.  I echo other reviewers' that the clip on the cover seems superfulous.  The drive is also a little large to be on a keychain.  It is nice that the keychain is attached to the base of the drive though.  This means you can't easily disconnect it from your keychain, but also means that it will be harder to lose."
967,2,"I have been looking for a set of headphones that I could use with my iPod Touch. I have tried MANY earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty. I could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price. I do have a pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 150v that came pretty close to what I was looking for (they were a steal at $16.00 shipped from Dell). However, I needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great. Well, after reading the reviews here I figured I would give these a try. I was shocked when I cranked up my iPod Touch with some Metallica and could hear ALL of the music without distortion. The Koss Porta-pros are very ""airy"" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+. I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s. My father bought me a Koss headphone set (I cannot remember the model), but listening to the current top 40 music of the day from my simple record player, I remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world. Looks like I just got back to my musical listening roots."
968,1,"No complaints on build and product quality! Its easy to assemble and wires hide behind the stand grove slots and its all good..It also make your bose speakers sound good but the problem begins when you sit at a place which is not equal distance from both speakers..!! You hear more from one speaker rather than equally from both of them... this doesnt happen when I kept the speakers on my TV stand one at each corner of my 55 inch Tv base... There it felt like awesome sound coming from TV rather than from speakers..!! It felt like characters in TV are speaking, when on bose stand it feels like characters are showing in TV and sound coming from speakers.. not very cohesive overall..  I am sure there would be plenty of people out there who wont agree with me but I think I will use my Bose Cinemate GS II without these stands.I am in my first week using these stands and more than a month into using Bose cinemate , definetly love the Bose system but am thinking seriously of returning the stands... will update this review with final action.01/12/2013 - Decided to keep the stand. The trick is to keep the stands a bit close to the TV table... also what I did is made sure that surface of the speaker front is in line with my TV .. This made it much more cohesive..."
969,2,Most of us have old VHS tapes in the closet and the VP-100 keeps your VCR delievering a clean image.What more can I say---it works!
970,0,"People are very loyal to their brands and Bose is no execption. I've owned many different models of higher end bose speakers for many years; including the lower end 201 bookshelf speakers. I'm about to reitre them as there are too many better speakers out there for the money. The bose speakers are great for people who lack a good ear for music and love a dead sounding speaker, meaning the highs aren't real high and the mid range is ok but there is more low range. You can adjust your tuner receiver all you want, but it's tough to really get the Bose to come to life like other speakers. I love Bose but will retire my 201 when the new speakers arrive.....for less money than the 201 but with much fuller sound that really comes to life.Bose speakers are great for people who lack a trained ear, and those stuck in the 1970s......"
971,2,"I am very happy with my cable lock. Although it does not make your computer equal to Fort Knox, it will at the very least slow a would-be theif down. I can hang my 8lb laptop off of it, and bounce it up and down  with the cable, and it holds firm (trial conducted over my bed, a heavily  padded surface). I like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to  avoid the cable kinking, and becoming cumbersome. I also like the fact that  it is a key operated system. Although combinations are quicker, they can be  hacked in about 5 minutes of trying, and slipping a key in the lock and  giving a quick turn can't be any simpler. Just remember to keep one key in  a safe place, and write the key serial number down somewhere so a  replacement can be found. For the money, I don't think there is a better  security option for notebook computers, unless you spend the $40 on a  doberman puppy, and train it to attack computer theifs. But that would be  hard. Buy this lock system, and it could save you $3000."
972,2,"i am pleased with this cd player, after searching thru best buy and circuit city it was a welcome relief to find a product i really wanted."
973,1,...ActiveSynch seems faster on Toshiba [than another machine].PocketStreets map program is 3 times slower on Toshiba!!!!Turns out it's because the Toshiba is extremely slow at reading the CF card. I found out by copying the map from the CF card to the internal flash ram.Adobe PDF viewer is a bit slower on the Toshiba. Again likely because of poor CF card read speed.I am noticing that the Toshiba's stylus seems to lose alignment after a while- not sure why.I don't like the ejection button for the Toshiba's CF card. The only way to push it back in is with the pen.Toshiba does not have a photoresistor so doesn't know how to adjust screen brightness dynamically. You never know how much you miss a feature until it's gone.Lack of backup battery on Toshiba is not good.Wireless works fine but I hear that the battery life is about 1 hour with wireless on.The graphics is reportedly faster with ATI's Imageon chip - but no way to tell so far.Default mediaplayer does not play MP3s. Have to install version 8 from the CD. Then reboot (they don't tell you about the reboot part).No scientific calculator on the Toshiba.Speaker on Toshiba is poor...So far it seems the main reason for getting the Toshiba is that it has built in WIFI which frees up the CF slot and provides an additional SecureDigital slot for memory...
974,2,"I've been using this trackball for about 6 years. It's a great product. I tend to ruin the chords after 2-3 years and have to purchase a replacement. My only complaint about this Trackball, and this is extremely irritating for me, is that Logitech has not changed the wireless receiver that attaches to the computer. Everyone is using tiny little USB receivers, as is Logitech for most of their wireless products. Yet this trackball has this stupid receiver that's about the size of a cookie, attached to a 5ft chord. I love this trackball, but if a competitor comes out with a similar Thumb driven trackball with a small receiver, I'll switch in a heartbeat."
975,1,"The Panasonic RQ-L31 is inexpensive and compact, and has a generous array of special features. These features include a handy ""odometer"" that provides a number that tracks the length of the tape, as you record or play. Another useful feature is a red colored light display that indicates the battery level. Other features are a pausing button, a button that activates voice activated recording, a button that slows down recording/playback, and a switch that increases recording sensitivity. Of course, you will find the usual essential buttons: record, play, fast forward, fast reverse.The quality of the recording is muddy and lacking in treble quality. However, this can be remedied by pushing the button that increases the sensitivity of recording. This button has a marked effect on increasing the treble (to a desired level). In fact, I used epoxy cement to cause permanent activation of this button. Since I wanted to make certain that the voice activating recording switch was left OFF, and the slow recording button was also left OFF, I used epoxy cement to permanently keep these buttons in the desired position. (I wanted to avoid accidental activation of either of these buttons, with the consequent ruining of my recordings.)A problem with this Panasonic recorder is that it causes crackling sounds to occur in the background of all of your recordings.  If you really do not want crackling sounds on all your recordings, you should seriously seek a digital voice recorder. (It is possible that my particular Panasonic recorder was a dud -- or lemon --  and is not representative of other new Panosonic recorders.)At any rate, this recorder is superior to the Sony V-O-R, CLEAR VOICE, TCM-200DV cassette recorder. This Sony recorder is equal in size to the Panasonic machine. However, the Sony recorder causes a horrible high-pitched whining sound to occur throughout the entire recording. This high-pitched whining sound, found on the Sony machine, has been noted by other reviewers on the Amazon site.Therefore, I would recommend the Panasonic recorder, but only if the high-sensitivity button is kept in the on-position, for example, with epoxy glue. If you fail to activate this button, the recording will be muddy and lacking in treble qualities.The sound quality of the cassette recorders from both Sony and Panasonic might be useful for self-teaching, where you need to learn things for your daytime job.  But these particular recorders are TERRIBLE for recording things of a personal nature, e.g., kids' birthday parties or nature sounds.  I would suggest, instead, buying the Olympus DS-40 digital recorder.Once you use the Olympus digital recorder, you will NEVER want to use a portable cassette recorder for RECORDING.  On the other hand, if you need to do some LISTENING, perhaps of a recording relating to your daytime job or to some project of a technical nature, a conventional cassette recorder is much more handy, and has better sound quality (because it has an actual built-in loudspeaker), than the Olympus DS-40 digital recorder.  Also, it is self-evident that the simple push-button control mechanism of the cassette recorder is much easier to use (for example when driving, or when using in limited light, as in an airplane), than the controls on any digital recorder."
976,2,This is the best invention since swiss cheese. Works great for a hands free photo. I would recommend this for any photogragher.
977,2,"Oh Koss PortaPro, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:This pair of headphones is my favorite pair of portable headphones I've ever owned (just barely edging out my Sennheiser headphones I owned for years). They're highly compact and yet still pack a punch, providing rich full sound and, *gasp*, decent bass output as well (something severely lacking in most headphones). The semi-hard case is also wonderful. I very, very rarely leave the house without these headphones. They fit snugly and are barely noticeable, even after hours of use.My somewhat trivial gripe with this product is that, as a male with short hair, the retractable metal band will pull out a single hair every now and then. Very painful and somewhat frustrating, but not worth taking a star away,My family's been using these headphones for well over 20 years now and I've yet to find much better for the price."
978,2,"I have been using this unit to fire my 430ex and 550ex flashes. It works flawlessly indoors. It can auto focus in complete darkness and the flashes do not need to be in line of site. Outdoors is another matter. It's difficult to line up the sensors even at close distances. Not that it's impossible, but it will require some patience."
979,0,I love listening to 1390 inspirational channel.  I could not pickup reception on this Walkman only a few stations were clear.  Did not get much use out of this one.
980,0,Purchased three pair of this product.Installed in home that is less than 3000 square feet.All worked initially and intermittently.All failed after a couple months of use.Complete garbage.
981,2,"My needs were simple, to lengthen the audio cord so I didn't have to worry about how i sat at work, and volume control.  I sit at the computer a bit from time to time, and like to stream music.The cord is long enough, about 3ft I believe.  The volume control is just that, basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out, but it means I can adjust it, rather than adjusting the volume on the computer.It does everything it is supposed to, and in a small package.  Worth the purchase."
982,0,"This is an ok radio except for the following:1) AM reception needs improvement. Sometimes you must hold the radio in your hand and angle it one direction, and then another, to keep reception on a somewhat even keel.2) Volume control is digital, controlled by two buttons. There are not enough volume settings. When the batteries are strong and you are in the vicinity of traffic noise, one volume setting is two low and the next one up is too high."
983,2,"With 10x Zoom and rechargable Lithium-Ion battery, how could you possibly go wrong!! If you are using the camera in bad light, or have to focus quickly, this camera does in both quickly and magnificently! Great for home movies of your wife and her lover getting it on behind the Chinese Buffet Dumpster!  With the 10X zoom you can really get close to the grease smears and nail marks on that dirty, dirty, dirty Jezebel. anyways, enough of my personal life. This is a good camera. Easy to use, Easy to figure out.  Sony, bravo. keep up the good work.  Much love to the Pacific Rim. Keep it (Digitally) Real. Word."
984,0,"I used to buy these all the time.  They were made in Japan and had a bluish dye to them, and when you held them up to the light, you couldn't see through them.  I never had a bad burn.The newer ones are now made in Taiwan.  They have a silver dye and are see-through when held up to the light. These CD's suck.  Don't buy them."
985,0,"I bought this for use with a Panasonic cordless phone. Problem is people say they cannot hear me very well. I have adjusted the mic so that it is touching my lips but still I am hard to hear. Some have said my voice sounds scratchy. Also when I speak it mutes the incoming audio, which should not be necessary with a headset. Very disappointed."
986,0,"I bought this lens as a gift for birthday. Item was delivered couple days before the scheduled arrival time and the packaging was just fine. But the lens happened to have a very noticeable back focus so camera didn't focus properly (especially on apertures 1.8 - 4.0) and most of pictures come out blurry. Too bad, going to return it and buy 50mm 1.4"
987,0,"Once again, you get what you pay for.  I use this with a Rebel XTi.  This lens works great, quiet enough focus and covers a good range at a great price.  However, I hope you like your pictures a little soft.  All my pictures are a little soft with this lens.  It is worth a little more money to get a better lens.  If you are just a student or taking a photography class and don't really need super sharp pictures this may be great for you."
988,2,"Finally found them on sale for $25. The sound is great. There is an emphasis on base but that's OK, I'm using this set with my FLAC player when I want music to wake me up and get me excited. I'm very happy with the purchase. If however you're looking for the perfect balance of sound and frequencies spend more money! For the average listener who just wants to get pumped, this is the set to buy. Besides, If you're listening to an iPod or any MP3 why would you want to spend more on a headset? There is only so much improvement that can be made considering the supression of the sound coming out of the device."
989,1,"Too small for Canon G6 or Canon S2 or S3.  Nice bag, but too small in the since it is not deep enough."
990,0,"These looked cool for those walks around the block, and the price was right.  But that's as good as it gets.  They may not bring down the neighborhood, but they bring down the once-proud name of Sony.  Not only is the sound of music sharp, tinny, and bass-deprived, but the pin never seems to lodge securely in my player, leading to distortion and the cutting out of sound in one of the headphones.My wife recently purchased a comparable pair of Brookstones at the airport.  They cost three times more, but they sound at least three times better."
991,2,After having read all the glowing reviews I purchased this item and was not disappointed.  This is a very nice full quality function CD player.  I have been very pleased with this item and its performance.
992,2,I bought this to take pictures of my infant and for macro picts.  It allows me to be away from the camera to trigger the shutter.  It does what it claims and does it well.
993,2,"Considering the price tag on these headphones, the sound is amazing. You won't find better sound for this much money. Even if you upgrade to something better, these are good to keep around for working out, doing chores around the house, etc., since they're lightweight and fit pretty snugly. I've owned mine for a year now and they still sound great.UPDATE: I've owned these for more than two years now, and I've treated them like crap -- wearing them when I work out, when I'm doing chores, working on the house, etc. They're INDESTRUCTIBLE, and they still sound great. I've gone through at least three pairs of in-ear headphones in the same amount of time. Buy these -- they'll last you years. You do have to get used to having a line imprinted on your head after using them for more than five minutes at a time, but I guess you can't have everything."
994,1,Kind of pricy to only work for 14 months.  The secondary board fried for some reason.  I might have given them a reasonable doubt if it was the power board but this could not have been caused by a surge.  I am looking for a replacement set that will sound as good as these but from another manufacturer.
995,2,"We bought this camera after Consumer Reports gave it a Best Buy rating, and because we'd had an older Canon SureShot which had recently died after 7 years of very good service.I was initially disturbed to find that the camera requires DX-coded film. I usually order my film from a mail order supplier and they do not carry DX film which, from what I've been able to discover, means that there is more information bar coded onto the canister. This I could live without. However, the manual tells you that it's possible to use regular film though it may be a little more difficult to load, and furthermore it will always register as ISO 25 (not 100 or 200 or 400)! I was pretty unhappy about all this.We bought some DX film and had it developed, taking pictures in many different circumstances -- indoors/outdoors, with/without flash, articial/natural light, etc. The results were very good in all conditions.Next, we loaded regular Kodak film (ISO 200). I could not get the film to load. I placed the reel in with various lengths of film exposed but that didn't help. I tried to depress the shutter button as recommended in the manual, but that did not help. My husband got the film to load on the first try. (I believe this is because I had warmed it up for him.) Again we took pictures in many circumstances and the quality, surprisingly, was fine.The features offered work well. The manual is good.  Also, the battery is much more reasonable than previous batteries, which cost about [price].  I would say the only problem withe this camera, as with its predecessor, is a sluggish zoom mechanism.A very good camera at a good price."
996,0,"BUY A ZALMAN!!!I purchased this chill mat, and it worked for a short period of time.  The connector would not stay in, because it was a prong-type connector and not a USB  connector.  The company sent me a new cord, but it would not stay in, either.  I tried every which way to support the connector, so it would stay in, but finally gave up!Bought the Zalman, and it has a variable fan, which is almost silent and haven't had a moment's problem with it.You won't regret going with the Zalman."
997,2,"I used this camera on the beach quite a bit last month, and it performed just as I hoped it would. I swam with it a few times, and it survived the submersion with flying colors, even floating to the top a few times when it slipped out of my pocket. I wasn't diving or anything, but for submersion within 10 feet of the surface, it did fine. Can't speak to deeper use.I didn't use the camera to take underwater pics, but it did fine with pictures above water when wet. The resolution is obviously a far cry from what you can get with even the cheapest digital camera now, so you should go in aware that these aren't museum-quality prints or anything. But for what it is, this camera does fine.I also highly recommend buying the camera from Amazon. They're not paying me to say this or anything, but I looked at local drugstores, and the exact same camera was literally 2.5-3 times as expensive. I can't for the life of me figure out why the mark-up is so high, but that's what it is in the Washington, DC, area."
998,0,"We got new HP ZR2440w monitors (the worst in the world) at work. The computer I have only has a VGA and an HDMI plug for monitors.  USB input can also be used but that solution only results in a small subset of video resolutions of the other two options. Those of us that don't have DVI plugs on our computer were given a DVI to USB adapter module. and I thought if I replaced it with this I would get more resolution choices like the HDMI option.  Instead it doesn't even see the monitor with this plug. If I unplug it I get a message that a monitor was unplugged, but when I plug it back in it doesn't see anything and the monitor shuts off. Maybe it works in other situations, but not this one."
999,1,returned it!
1000,2,"Many people will tell you that you can't tell one CD player or CD changer from another as far as sound.  Well it seems as though I can and this JVC machine has the best specs in it's price range.  I listen to everything from Rock to Classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none.  There are more ""advanced"" CD changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they don't come close to the sound of this CD changer.I guess I am bad talking about the features of this machine.  So I will leave that up to somebody else.  I will say that you can load three CDs at one time which is more than most CD changers.  I just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproduction.EDIT:  Right now I am a man with two stereos.  I know that I should be so lucky.  This JVC is with my OLD ""A"" system.  I have owned this model or the 158 just below it a few times before. My last JVC 258 lasted only 9 months before starting to skip uncontrollably.  I have had durability problems with this model even though as I've said it has the best specs in it's class.  When not owning the JVC I've owned a Harmon Kardon which sounded superior, but costed more, and broke after only 3 months.  I've also owned Sony's both the budget, mid, and high-end models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or MP3's.  Currently my ""B"" system has a Yamaha 697 which has great specs, but is more expensive.  I hope the Yamaha will be more durable."
1001,2,"I just bought these over the ear Koss Porta Pro classic phones today. I traded in my Ludacris Soul SL99's and some Sennheiser CX310's for cash and I purchased these. LOVE THE SOUND! Totally worth the deal it took to get these. Tight, but not overpowering bass, and crisp mids and highs. I hear all the details in the music, plus the energy exhibited in these phones is just phenomenal for the price. I bought these based on their being a top 5 value pick on CNET, which ranked the Klipsch S4's as the top value headphones. i own two pairs of those, and the Koss Porta Pros, and they couldn't be more accurate. Retro look yet classy. compact. tight fit. tight sound. great price. no complaints."
1002,0,"Full Disclosure:  I have just decided to buy a Linksys unit after hours on hold/talking with D-Link tech support who couldn't solve an apparently simple WEP setup problem.  On the other hand, I have owned several wireles router products, and have been setting up Windows networks for 7 years.The Good:*  Well priced*  Units reasonably good looking*  If all you want to do is set up a simple, non-secure wireless connection, D-Link works just fine.The Bad:*  Confusing setup screens make secure wireless connections difficult to set up (since security is now required, weight this difficulty heavily).*  Poor manuals and web site resources make configuration and troubleshooting difficult.*  Poor technical support.  They do offer phone support, but the techs seem as clueless as most beginner customers.*  Upgrading your unit is made more difficult by D-Link's practise of making multiple, near-identical units with subtle but critical differences between them.  So you have to look at pictures on their site to figure out which model you really have.The Ugly:*  D-Link's level 2 tech support finally said that they can't help when users don't use D-Link products on *BOTH* sides of a wireless connection.  So, if you have built-in wireless capabilities in your Dell, IBM, Apple, ....., laptop, might want to buy another router.Bottom line - buy something else."
1003,0,I bought this Trek Antenna with the Sangen WR-2 radio. Matter a fact it came yesterday morning. I setup the radio and antenna. The antenna did NOTHING to improve my reception. I am not in a fringe area but I have a small mountain range between me and 3 of the radio stations I listen too. I have another that is 125 miles away from me. None of the stations improved. So this morning I am returning the Trek Antenna and getting a refund.I am not saying this is a bad product it just did not work for me.James
1004,2,"I've been listening to these for years and years.  For the price they are simply amazing.  Great bass response.  Crystal clear highs.  Wonderful for all kinds of music: pop, rock, jazz, classical, soundtracks.  I actively go out and listen to the competition all the time.  I did just order the Sennheister Px 100s because evidently they edge past the Koss headphones.  I find this hard to believe, but we'll see.  I do love the Bose Q2's and plan to get those for home and travel.  But when it comes to serious street bopping: for the Koss.  You will not be sorry!! Promise."
1005,0,this cable has terrible sound quality.  The sound is garbled and staticy and the cord has to be adjusted to even hear any bass.  Contacted the seller and was refunded.
1006,0,"I wanted a 20mm prime to use for night shooting, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I chose poorly.  Returned it the same day.  Still on the hunt for a good prime night long exposure performer.This lens was really soft around the edges (even on my 40D with a 1.6x FOVCF).  Although I don't need a fast focusing lens for night use, this lens still focused slowly during its day use.It's grossly overpriced.  Should be only $299 at most."
1007,2,"127 reviews later, i'll sum up the critical reasons why *i* absolutely love these ""stereophones"".i've tried a LOT of different earbud headphones looking for that obnoxious, over the top, chest-pounding heart attack bass sound that typifies my favorite style of music, drum'n'bass. they all fell far, far short compared to the PLUG. i was even willing to spend the big money on those Shure's and Etymotics but i've read they are weak with bass as well. dont bother with those sony ex51/71 fontopia's. they were a huge sonic disappointment and they have that stupid long right/short left cable arrangement. not these puppies. symmetrical cables baby!bad parts:1) eventually the foam cushions go ""bad"" from too much use and dont ""inflate"" the way they used to after being squeezed, causing them to fall out and dampen that beautiful bass. i used to just buy a new set when this happened (~1 year) but i just found out about these ""plug mods"" so i'll try that now.2) ear wax buildup! eeewww! yes, well, what else did you expect? luckily the plugs lend themselves to a very easy clean if you have a paperclip or baby pin. but they do get very juicy pretty fast so dont buy these suckers used or try to share with your buddy.3) purple color is lame.4) no case provided and its gross sticking juicy buds in yr linty pants pocket and then putting em back in your ear.if you are some audiophile nerd who is more interested in highs than lows, i can't recommend these at all. if you've ever said ""turn the bass down"" out loud to someone, keep searching. but if you like the feeling of a big foam bullet gradually expanding in your ear like a snuggly pillow, pick these up today."
1008,0,"I wanted a better set of headphones, so I purchased a set of Bose Tri-Port headphones at the Best Buy store in Sioux Falls, SD. The sound the Tri-Ports produced was very good, but they only lasted about four months until late one night the left ear cup literally fell apart in my hands. My electronic equipment is very important to me, I do not treat it rough or abuse it in any way, the Tri-Ports just disintegrated. My first warning should have been the broken Bose display headphones at the Best Buy store, because mine fell apart in exactly the same spot where they were broken. On the positive side the people at the Bose store at the Mall of America were great, they replaced the Tri-Ports with no questions asked even though I did not buy the headphones in their store. In fact, I used the old Tri-Ports as a down payment on the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones. I really love the sound the Quiet Comfort 2's produce, but you know what ? I recently noticed a piece of plastic broken out of the left head band support -- Uh Oh !! Bose headphones produce very good sound, but they are fragile like eggshells."
1009,1,"I have the DVD-V1000 model which is basically the same unit and while it does exactly as advertised as with any ""combo"" type unit the remote control is confusing as hell. It'll play DVD's/CD's, CDRW's and DVD-R's. It wont play DVD+R's/+RW's. It also plays disc's with mp3's and some DVD-RW's...your mileage may vary;-} . Stick a blank tape in the vhs slot while a dvd is in the disc slot hit record on the vcr side and whalla!! you've recorded however long of a logo screen that says Samsung and nothing else. Overall it's a good dvd and vcr but all in ones are a pain."
1010,1,"MS could have done better with this mouse. Overall, it performs well but it doesn't feel as solidly built as the mechanical wheel mouse it replaces.  The optical mouse is light, very light.  A kink in the cord will push the mouse back when you lift your hand.  A small metal slug within the mouse body would have given it more heft and better feel in my opinion.  The buttons have the same feel as the mechanical version but the wheel is a bit looser in comparison.This mouse has a PS/2 style connector and MS also supplies an adapter to use with a free USB port if you're so inclined.  Fit and finish are up to the usual MS mouse standards and it has a generous cord length.A bit more heft and a better scroll wheel would move this mouse from a 3-star to a 5-star performer."
1011,0,"I have tried this with a Panasonic phone and with a 3rd party branded phone that has a compatible adapter.  For sound, I can hear, but it is muffled.  When I tried speaking, it kept cutting out, and I had to go back to the handset.I find it unlikely that this is a Panasonic-branded headset.  There is nothing printed on it indicating a part number, no instructions (though probably not necessary,) etc.  However, this is no surprise for the price."
1012,0,"I bought this switch on Amazon almost a year ago and it has performed flawlessly. However, it has one big detractor... it's loud. One would assume the problem is the fan being too loud, but that's not it... well... not entirely.I did some testing with three different 40x40x20mm 5v fans and the results are a bit surprising. Turns out the underlying issue here isn't the fan's db levels, but the transmission of the vibration through the switch's chassis. Yes, the stock fan was the loudest of the three (the lowest db fan tested was rated at 18db) but not by much. If you run each fan separate from the unit each is actually pretty quiet. It is not until the fan is places in the chassis that the noise becomes apparent. Since we know the fans themselves aren't loud (they are actually pretty quiet) we can then assume that the ""noise"" being generated is due to the transmission of the fan's vibration through the chassis. The various fans tested didn't change the db level much, but the pitch would vary slightly per unit. I simply found a pitch that wasn't as noticeable.The real solution to this problem would be to isolate the fans from the chassis more. It seems as if older units used twin 40x40x10mm fans which likely didn't produce as much vibration (but were louder in db) as the 20mm variants do. Without hacking things up I don't really see a simple solution to this issue (on the current single fan version.)I could potentially see trying to use a single 40x40x10mm fan, isolating it from the chassis with some rubber, and add a little ducting to the egress. FYI the stock fan flows ~6-7cfm. I may try messing with this again at a later date, but for now it's not a high enough priority since the switch is located in a network/server closet anyway. That said, if I listen as I walk past the room the closet is in I can still hear the switch humming even with the closet door closed. In the end it is a great switch if you are just needing an unmanaged gigabit switch.[UPDATE: 2/9/2013]The switch worked well for a while, Unfortunately, it failed after about 18 months of use in a VERY low demand environment. By low demand I mean 2x actual users, 6x computers (2-3 used at a time at most), and 2x PS3's used primarily as media renderers. Switch was also powered via a UPS with voltage regulation in a ventilated network closet. I wound up replacing the switch with a Cisco SG-200-26 which has significantly more features and time and again has proven to be much more reliable, and well worth the difference in price."

1014,0,"All the positive reviews convinced me to buy this lens even though it was used and no longer being manufactured.  The seller provided documentation that the lens had just been serviced by Nikon but I found the images to be soft.....not extremely sharp as noted in other reviews.  I'm sure there are very good copies of this lens, I just didn't get one of them.  Luckily, the seller was willing to take it back....the advantage of doing business with Amazon."
1015,0,I bought this for a Sony H1 camera.  This camera has a LCD size of 2.5 inches so none of the presized lines on the back could help me.  Where others could get 12 films out of it I can only get three.  My first one got a piece of dirt on it and it ruined my field of sight.  The second is not sticking to the bottom.  I have a very snug camera bag and everytime I pull the camera out or place it in it rubs the film.  I've only had it on a couple of hours and the bottom is already curling off.  I've taped it for now but needless to say I'm still in the market for some type of protection for the LCD screen.  It's inexpensive but you get what you pay for.
1016,0,"Plugged it in, right away I started getting shocked, next came the blue screen at shut down warning about USB Device, Called DLink, couldn't understand them, they couldn't understand me (don't you love OUT-SOURCING), they didn't even know what a hub was, kept asking me which windows I was using. Finally after them asking WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHOCKED? I just told them it was saying vulgar things to me and hung up. Never again, and I bought two of these. ;-(Bill in Las Vegas"

1018,1,"This cassette deck does have some really good features like HX Pro, Dolby B &amp; C, music search (AMS, which looks for blank spaces to guess where the next song is), and full dubbing capabilities. I have it connected to my Onkyo A/V receiver via both output and input, since all of my components operate through the receiver. It works well this way and i can record from all sources with no problem.I have a problem with the sound. It's not as good as the specs would have you believe. I've compared it with an Onkyo tape recorder and, although the numbers are similar (as far as wow &amp; flutter and dynamic range), the Onkyo is much better (it was too expensive and had less features, but now i see why it cost more). The big thing is the lack of a remote. Sony has this funky A1II communication bus system, which is only truly useful if you buy all Sony components. I don't so it's useless to me. The excuse for not including the remote is that you can buy a Sony 300-CD Changer that can control this tape deck. I don't like it when companies use this method to obtain sales, so chances are i'll eventually resell this deck and get one with its own remote and better sound.I paid $150 + tax at Circuit City. Same price as from J&amp;R/Amazon and with shipping costs the price is almost equal. I'd say buy it if the price is $110 or less. That's all it's worth to me personally."
1019,2,"You gotta have this if you're serious about flash photography. It makes a world of difference. If you're using your strobes on a stand you'll need a longer cord than the base model. My next one will be longer, but this model is good for things like hand held off camera shooting or for using with camera grips like the stroboframe."
1020,0,"I have three of these mice, all gathering dust: the first, a Christmas present; the second, obtained when the Christmas present died; the third, a replacement for my wife who confiscated the second mouse and liked its light weight even though it was explained that the mouse was a cheap, poorly constructed product which accounted for its light weight. All three mice died, all very soon after the end of warranty - how's that for precise product engineering? Do you think Macally will provide any replacement or reduction in price even if it's only a couple of weeks past warranty expiration - NO! - absolutely not!As to the problems: initially, the scroll wheel begins to fail and finally does. Shortly after the scroll wheel begins failing, when the pointer is placed in an open window or pane of a browser, the window or pane jumps up and down by 1/2"". Needless to say this makes it difficult to track and select what your after in either window or pane. This finally becomes intolerable as you scrabble about trying to open the file that you want or select your item in the web page.As to tech support, a joke. There seems to be only one techie who does not speak the King's - er - Queen's English. His comments concerning mouse failure proceed along the lines of ""you have been failing to properly be of installing the driver software. You must begin again to properly be of installing. This will be of solution to your problem."" End of discussion, if you can call it that.What Macally calls customer support appears to be only one very rude young woman who is incapable of operating outside her very limited training box. No customer support/help here.Suffice it to say, I will not purchase any Macally product of any sort again if I can avoid doing so. As to the mouse, a poor product with poor support and, in my opinion, an extremely poor company as well.My advice, do not buy. Essentially, junk."
1021,1,16 gauge speaker wire probably isn't the best best for my situation but I made it work. The only problem I ran into with this wire is that when stripping the ends some of the copper would stay attached to the sheath when you pull it off. Weak copper strands. Got it working fine and I was fairly inexpensive so I can't complain too much but I'm only leaving a 3 star review.
1022,1,The right guage wire for most home theatre systems.You will need to determine if you need one or two rolls depending on the size of your room and the loction of your speakers.Good price.
1023,2,"I bought the D-490 in December 2000 and am very impressed with the camera so far. I'm always amazed at the clearity and sharpness of the photos I take. When I print them out, they look like regular 35mm photos, as long as I don't blow them up too big. This is my first digital camera, and I love being able to email photos so easily to friends and family. They have told me how remarkably clear the photos I send them are. In fact, one friend was so impressed, he bought a D-490 too. Batteries last a long time in this camera which is nice, some cameras can really eat up the batteries, but this one suprises me. I must take like a hundred photos in between battery changes. The only down side to this camera is that sometimes the photos are a little dark, but this is easily remedied with some photo enhancing software. I may be able to change the exposure setting on the camera to lighten it up a bit, but haven't played with that yet. The downloading hardware that comes with the camera is way to slow, so just go buy a USB reader and you'll be set."
1024,2,"I bought this for my first snorkeling trip.  I didn't take many pictures and my foggy snorkel mask made it a bit difficult, but I did get a few very clear good shots.I would buy this again if I went snorkeling.Conditions: mid-afternoon, sunny, coral reefs in Bermuda water too deep to stand but not that deep (reefs sometimes pretty much at eye level)"
1025,0,"We needed a powered USB hub to hook up scanner, webcam, and digital camera to our G4 iMac. The first two on the list needed to be plugged in directly to the iMac, or to a powered hub, so we were always shuffling plugs between these items.We bought this D-Link. Scanner, webcam both generated ""Low Power"" warnings on our screen and were unusuable. We had plugged in the power supply, done everything as per instructions.Finally just returned this to Amazon, and bought an IBM hub for about $10 less at local computer store. It works fine.So...either the D-Link design is poor, or we got a dud item."
1026,0,Trendnet makes a good product. I have a network printer server from them and it works great. I did some research before purchasing this item and it was supposed to be compatible with Vista. However it does not work with Vista x64 bit. I emailed support and they said it was not compatible and they had no immediate plans to make a 64-bit driver available.
1027,0,"I bought this in Feb 2007 for $70 and it broke after 9 months. They replaced it under warrenty. In May 2010 I replaced my PC with a new PC with Win 7 OS. Their original CD that I kept would not work in the new PC. When I called them for help they told me that since the warrenty was over they would not help me operate it on a new Win 7 PC  .. UNLESS I paid $40 for 6 months of telephone help. I borrowed my son's 5 year old Netgear router and it worked immediately, was easier to install and easily get all the necessary data for adding other laptops, etc. Plus the Netgear costs $35 here on Amazon which is half Linksys cost and less than their phone support. Additionally Netgear's relibility appears to be much greater than LinkS."
1028,0,This battery states Olympus so I expected it to be better than cheaper brand knockoffs - not!  I should have stuck to the cheaper brands as this one we paid more and ran out quickly.
1029,2,"I think these work great.  fit well, sound is just fine, and for the price, I've not found anything remotely in the same league.  I can only assume the part about tasting good, as I have not eaten them myself, but my cat has devoured several sets, so my presumption is, in a pinch, wouldn't make a half-bad snack."
1030,2,put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr.  My tv/vcr combo is an old model that I found free on the road side  which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent.  After playing the tape twice I now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the  vcr playback!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1031,1,This monitor is really loud which makes you want to leave it off rather than monitor your yard.  It works great other than the low setting is loud enough to wake the dead.
1032,0,"I have this camera for 3 years. The image quality is OK, optics are good. Battery life is good. Now 3 years later cameras have bigger displays, but thats not a negative point for this camera as it came out in a time this size was usual.The big bad thing with this camera is its respond time, and this really makes the good things pretty useless. It needs about 1-2 seconds from the moment I hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture, and I have had so much occasion with peoples, where this ruined the take. Specially with kids, you have a good moment and shoot, but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away. Also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow, there go other 10 good moments until the cam is ready again. Maybe the save file time can be shortened with a better highspeed flash card, the one I use is a standard card. But it will still be too much time to save the image. I am going now purchasing a Canon Powershot A710."
1033,2,"Not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice, exceptional; is the first word that comes to mind. These are not just good for the price, they are just good. There is always a satisfying feeling I get when I feel like I received more than I payed for, and that is exactly what I received here. Very highly recommended."
1034,0,"I agree with whoever said too much software installed. I prefer plug and play, no hassle. I also think the image is awful and I have a pretty good computer system. It had static on image and just did not look clear at all. My 8 year old quickcam had a nice picture so I expected this to be nice also.....no luck!Also, the box says Mac compatible, which I thought was cool since I have 2 systems (WinXP/Mac) and then I get home, go to support website & see it's not for Mac. Huh???In any case, this was returned and I'm getting something different."
1035,0,"The DI-604 was working fine for about 2 weeks, then it would no longer get assigned an IP address from the WAN/cable modem. No matter what I did, the DI-604 would NOT connect to the outside world. I swapped in an older router I had, and my LAN was accessing the internet just fine. The DI-604 is headed back to Amazon for a refund."
1036,2,"The Koss PortaPro has a great &#34;retro&#34; design because they haven't changed the darn things since they were introduced in the 80s. The reason being that they got it right the first time. The sound quality is great for open design headphones, they're easily adjustable (both the headband and the firmness with which the ears &#34;grab&#34; the head), very light, and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issues.They fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag. If mine get damaged, I will buy another pair."
1037,0,"The design of and features on this remote are quite nice. But it does not seem to work with hard drive recording systems. I also can't get it to work with our Sony received. There is a support number, but the hours are 9 - 5, Monday - Friday. So, those of us who have to work can't easily call for help. I sent an email to their support, but have not received any reply yet. It's been three weeks."
1038,1,Well its all in the tittle.  I thought they sounded great but only lasted a year or so...You cant ask for much more these days.  Get use to this s*** because we are american and we don't vote with our dollar we vote with a fake ballot.
1039,1,Nothing more or less then what you pay for. I needed something inexpensive for this job. It did it perfectly.
1040,1,"The Antenna works OK.  However, it is not very good for using in a city dwelling."
1041,0,"I have 2 TiVo units (80 hour and 40 hour) that I have connected to my home network via wireless. I purchased 2 units thinking it was going to be the ultimate television experience, and because there is no way to record 2 programs at once with one unit (e.g. 24 and Frasier concurrently).The positives: Using TiVo to record programs is even easier than you will expect. Playback with pause and rewind of live TV is great. Once you get it set up, doing things over the home network really makes it simple.The negatives: If you have a cable box with digital audio output, it (digital audio) will not work with TiVo, and neither will HDTV. Also, it does not include Component Video inputs or outputs, so you are left to use inferior connections. From these perspectives, buying TiVo now assures you are buying a product that will shortly be obsolete. You will be disappointed in the quality of playback on HDTV and of the audio quality, compared simply to just using a cable box or satellite with HDTV receiver. It is really behind the times on these areas. Also, their warranty and service is poor. There is only a 90-day warranty on labor (1-year parts), and you must call a toll (i.e. not toll-free) number and wait on hold for 10+ minutes to get service. Web support is non-existent. One of our units was louder than the other from the day we bought them, and has grown louder and louder to the point we needed to call for support. After initially refusing to service the unit unless I pay $99 for the service, TiVo (1 month past 3 month warranty window), finally agreed to reduce the cost to $49, since their web site led us to believe the sound was normal when we first received the unit. Unfortunately, this ""fix"" will only guarantee that the replacement box will work for 30 days - after that I will need to pay full price to repair it, if it has an issue. Given that they are sending me a replacement unit (i.e. from a ""service inventory"" rather than repairing the one I own), I have a feeling that there are far more issues with the boxes than people believe. It is not surprising, since the units use a hard drive with a fan (i.e. with moving parts - not flash memory), which run 24 x 7. Overall, I find product quality marginal at best and customer service to be exceptionally poor. (It took a lot to get the service price reduced, even though we firmly believe our unit was defective from Day 1.)Also, don't be fooled by the capacity noted on the product. It only holds 40 hours of programming if you use the worst quality setting, which most people would find unacceptable. A more realistic capacity is 25% - 50% of the ""quoted capacity"", which is what you will find if you use the 2 higher quality settings.Finally, I am most disturbed by the reviews of some of the TiVo fanatics, particularly some of the people on the TiVo community site. These folks believe that TiVo is the ultimate and will lead you to believe it, so you also buy it! Others are so thrilled with some of the features, they do not take the time to fully understand the product before writing a review. For example, a subsequent (to my first writing) reviewer claims there is no need to purchase a box + a subscription, but obviously has no idea what he is talking about. It is as plain as day on the TiVo site. You need to buy the equipment + either a monthly or lifetime subscription. If you want to share between the units (i.e. record on one watch on another), you also need to purchase network cards + the home media option for BOTH units. It is not inexpensive. 2 units + lifetime service + cards + HMO = over $1,200) It is also a little disturbing to see only positive reviews in the Amazon spotlight, given that there are genuine issues to consider when purchasing this product.If you are considering TiVo now, I strongly recommend that you wait until they release a product that is compatible with HDTV and digital audio before making the investment. They market these Series II boxes like they are the latest and greatest, but in reality, they are already about obsolete. Remember, a lifetime subscription pertains to the life of the unit - not your life. If you buy this now and find it obsolete in a year (i.e. when you buy HDTV), you will need to buy another unit AND service again."
1042,2,"A lot of people have already reviewed this, so I'll just address some of the negative comments I've seen.1. Battery life: This uses 2 AAA batteries. I highly suggest having and using at least 2 sets of rechargeable batteries because the batteries last only about 3 days with regular reading and using the backlight. You'll save yourself a lot of money by just using rechargeables.2. Losing everything when you change out the battery/Reloading the operating system: On Amazon I bought a 64 MB MMC card for ~$14 (that's including the shipping[...]). You can backup the operating system and your books onto the MMC card. If the batteries run out or you change them the EBM 911 will automatically restore from the MMC card so that you won't have to restore from your PC. Even if you do restore from your PC, it takes only a few minutes, but the MMC option is more convenient.3. Lack of books: I noticed that some people seem to think there're a lack of books for this reader. The reader includes MobiPocket reader and there're thousands of books available at [...], [...] and [...] to name just a few. You'll have no problem finding books for this reader.Overall, I like this reader. It fits in my hand and isn't heavy. Page turning is done either by a toggle wheel on the side or by tapping the left or right side of the screen. It fits in my jean and coat pockets so it's easy to carry.I do plan to eventually upgrade to either the Barnes and Noble Nook or the forthcoming Alex Reader when it comes out at Borders, but for now this works fine for my needs. The reason I'll upgrade is because I do like the e-Ink display on the newer readers. However, one advantage of the EBM is that it has a back light display which makes reading in bed at night much more convenient than having to use a separate booklight. There's no way to back light the e-Ink readers so you'll need a separate book light."
1043,1,"Well, for closed headphones built for a really high noise attenuation these are fairly good.  They obviously have next to no soundstage at all (not much room inside there at all) and the bass is terrible though.  There's a modification known as the Blue-Tak mod wherein you line the inside with Blue-Tak putty which helps a good bit by absorbing some of the vibrations and reducing distortion.  I've also taken it a bit further and even tried to add capacitors to each to act as a first-order high-pass filter reducing the bass a little bit.  Still, the mids are very badly recessed and the highs are less than ideal all the same.  (It probably needs a second order filter at least.)  Heavily equalization is necessary, but I personally hate equalization (it never sounds quite right, plus you have to enable/disable it or even change it around every time you change headphones/speakers/etc which is really troublesome when you use the same player with multiple devices/locations.)Still, you're not going to find much better in closed headphones that are TRULY closed.  Most that do sound a lot better -- for example, the Denon AH-D2000/5000/7000 or even the low end AH-D1000/1001 -- are semi-open designs with very little actual attenuation and a lot of sound leakage which is part of why they sound so much better, whereas these have almost no sound leakage at all and attenuate outside noise by a lot.  At this pricerange, I seriously doubt you can find any that can match its attenuation that doesn't sound a lot worse."
1044,0,"I found these to be very uncomfortable, and the fit is odd. They just feel wierd. Sound quality is decent, and for the price they're okay. I would not buy again."
1045,2,"While my grandchildren haven't used them yet, because they are disappointed that they are not digital, I know that will enjoy the picture that take later this week when I kind of force them to use them while swimming.  They really don't appreciate that they are waterproof."
1046,2,"Installed this in my 4x4, fits entirely in the center console when I'm not using it. With a 3' Firestik antenna I've had conversations with base stations 20 miles away. Overall love it for being compact and versatile."
1047,0,This router seems to have a range of about 12 feet. Seriously. I recommend the similar SMC wireless router.
1048,2,"This is a very simple remote control.  It provides just the bare minimum capability that one would want in a remote control.  Used with my Rebel XTi, it supports the 1/2 depressed auto-focus and exposure and the fully depressed shutter release.It also has a nice, simple slide plate that will lock the button in the fully depressed position to hold the shutter open for the ""long duration"" exposures.The product is made entirely of plastic (which feels a bit flimsy; but is surprisingly rugged in my experience) and has an oval cross section (which takes a little getting used to).  Being made of plastic, this product is very lightweight (which is a plus in my opinion).My only complaint, echoed by several other reviewers, is that the connecting cable is very short.  In fact, in my estimation, it is even too short for when you actually want to be close to the camera (which is the case for me doing a fair amount of close-up macro-photography).  It is so short that I have a hard time making sure I don't bump the camera.But the good news is that, as at leat one other reviewer noted, you can easily get an extension from any electrical supply house or from Radio Shack.  The plug is an 8/32"" stereo plug and, if you get your extension from Radio Shack, you'll need to gat a couple of 8/32""-to-1/4"" stereo adapters and use the 1/4"" stereo extension cords (the one I got is 14 feet long).  Total cost was about $5 so it's no big expense.My only complaint with my solution is that the adapters stick out quite a bit from the body of the camera and they can cause torque on the camera if you're not careful to ensure that there isn't any tension pulling on the adapter.I am most happy with this product.  For me, it is a much better solution than the wireless solutions which (1) require you to be almost directly in front of the camear and (2) which, in my experience, tend to frequently but inadvertantly get the infrared signal showing up in the photograph.It is a shame that Canon doesn't make the cable on the product about another foot to two feet longer.  I think that show poor engineering judgement on Canon's part.But the problem is easily enough remidied so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to anyone looknig for an inexpensive, simple, and flexible solution to remote triggering of their Canon cameras."
1049,0,Earpiece is too small for an adult.  Plastic headband is sized for a child and is uncomfortably tight even when expanded fully.
1050,0,I bought these to use while i went I go running but as soon as I start to sweat a little the &#34;non-slip design&#34; fails. They are not very comfortable and the sound quality is about what you should expect from $10 headphones. Buy these if you just want a pair that you dont mind if you lose or if its for a Kid that seems to destroy everything.
1051,2,"I've been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under $100. That might not be correct, though... You may have to go up to $250 to find cans as good as these. For the price, they simply cannot be beat. They are light, super-comfortable, and they sound great. The only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently, the cord *will* break. It's not even a matter of ""if"", it's a matter of ""when"". I've gone through 4 or so pairs of these things. They're cheap though, so it doesn't bother me."
1052,2,"This recorder does its job well, but be careful with it.  The battery cover breaks easily if this thing is dropped or knocked around.  If it were more sturdy (especially the battery cover / latch), I would give it five stars.  (A great broken recorder is still broken.)"
1053,1,"This thing was great when it was working.  Played all sort of formats for it's day and was relatively compact.  Then after a year or so, the damn thing started acting up with freezing and skipping and eventually it gave out.  There are plenty of hacks for it, but with prices so low for a new DVD player, it's not even worth your time to play with it.  I didn't try to repair it, instead it was replaced by a Philips DVD player which could play DivX MPG4 too."
1054,2,"Easy to use, good documentation, small &amp; practical design. Great deal for a 1.3 megapixel camera. Excellent for beginners.Only downside I found: batteries run out fast!"
1055,2,"I have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime. Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any ""premature"" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of ""break in"" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is ""totally awesome"". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over. I wish I'd found these 15 years ago when I started using headphones for the first time."
1056,0,I have had two of these routers both of which have failed shortly after the warranty expired.  I kept the router on 24/7 but for some reason if the router gets unplugged from the power outlet it is difficult and finally impossible to get the router to come back up after plugging back in (after the warranty expired no less).  The test light stays on continously now on both routers.  No amount of resetting/unplugging has brought them out of the test mode.  I'm guessing that they are using poor quality components to keep the price so cheap.  I also use a very expensive line conditioner that it is/was plugged into to no avail.  Will be looking at a SonicWall device for a replacement.
1057,2,I bought this to transfer old cassettes to disc. It has been a wonder to work with. I have found nothing that doesn't work beyond expectations. With the auto-reverse I just start it up and copy the whole tape to pc in no time at all. Playback on the cassette deck is great.
1058,2,"I received this item very quickly and immediately noticed they were not twice the size of the 4"" ones that came in the same box... upon measuring them, they are 11"" zip ties in a package labeled 8"" and has a label stuck over the label on the bag; however the old label also says 8"" so I am not sure what happened, especially since they fit in the bag...  I did not bother contacting the seller as if the packaging was mislabeled, I was more likely to get the same item the next time... (I believe the ones I bought were sold not by amazon, but stored in an amazon website, thus the double labels...)anyway, they are thick and sturdy ties, not likely to break easily; however out of the 10+ that I have used successfully, I had to trash 2 already that did not have a lock in them at all.  if that averages out across the entire pack, I'll have closer to 20% failure rate.  considering the price, a penny plus $5 shipping, that is not such a good deal.  The 4"" ties I purchasedAmico 1000 Pcs 110mm x 2mm Self Locking Wire Cable Zip Tie 4.3"" Blackwere 1000 in a bag, $1.76 AND free shipping (apparently they are no longer available at that price, I should have bought 2 or 3 bags), also I've used more than 60 of them with out one failing, at that rate it would be cheaper to connect 3x4"" ties together instead of buying 8"" ties that are really 11"" when I only actually needed 6"" ties, but could not find any for sale at a reasonable price.Overall it is not as though I bought something for a couple hundred dollars, I can still use them and cut them smaller as needed.  I bought this for the cuttingXuron 2175 Maxi-Shear Flush Cutterand it works perfect, clean, non-sharp cuts right down the lock and has no problems even cutting these thicker ties.I took 1 star off for the failure rate, and one for the quantity and price, but I put one star back, as when I added the link to the 1000 4.3"" ties I noticed the price I bought them at has changed to be more in line with the price I paid for the 8"" ones...The good news is if I ever have to tie up someone who has broken into my house, I can use these, as long as I can find one that is not broken."
1059,0,"Have to agree with people on this, it appears that the function of the power adapter is the light the leds on the unit.  My iphone does not charge, my blue tooth ear piece does not flash and my WD portable drive all report errors, even as the only device plugged in.Feel a bit ripped off, and I may of been better off going with a no name brand if this is dlink's job one work."
1060,1,"Was a little difficult to put together -- holes for inserting the metal into the wood base are not necessarily in the exact right place -- it needed a little tweaking, but I finally got it right.  It really is pretty decent looking once assembled, and it hold a lot of CDs."
1061,2,"OK....so here goes another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the Sennheiser 100's? I am not going to bore you..Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod...I own them both...So which one is my preference? The Sennheisers, for one reason only...People use their Ipods in malls and on the go. There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments (say, in a store or when having conversation).With the Sennheisers, I can remove the phones from my ears and let them ""hang"" around my neck in comfort...Try this with the Koss's and they will place a stranglehold on you. For this reason alone, I recommend the Senn's. Both,in my humble opinion, sound equally good."
1062,1,"The sound quality seems to be decent (I haven't A/B'd the cable against anything else, so YMMV).  It was relatively easy to thread through my walls, the exterior insulation is tough but pliable, and the string used to remove the exterior insulation works.My only beef (and the reason I knocked off a star) is that it was well short of 100 feet."
1063,2,"There are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours, so I will only mention a few points:1) I had the Sportapros. They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.They are worth every penny!"
1064,0,"In spite of reliability problems with previous Linksys routers, I bought this one because the WRT54G was supported by Sveasoft. Now it turns out that I was shipped the V5 version of this router which has been modified to NOT run this popular, powerful, inexpensive firmware.  This was NOT mentioned in the product listing.I can't imagine what motive Linksys had for this, since they don't get revenue from their own firmware.  It just seems like a downgrade for no reason.Two stars rather than 1, because it did work right out of the box without problems."
1065,1,"I purchased this speaker system about 3 years ago, and it has been a constant love/hate relationship. There are so many pro's and con's for these speakers. I'm not gonna go into all of them, just the ones I considered to be most relevant in my uses:The pro's include:-amazing sound quality and range. I love feeling the rumble, and with this sub, I rarely turned the tone knob above about a third for a movie and maybe halfway or so for some hard trance, metal, rock, and even some older rap. The mids were clean and clear. So clear that I could hear someone coughing in a live recording of Mannheim Steamroller.  And the highs? Unreal! You can put in some old big band jazz, like Maynard Ferguson, and there is almost no distortion to the screaming trumpet.  No matter if I was watching a movie via my laptop, jamming to pandora through my phone, or using an old sony walkman, the sound was always superb.-very strong design. Considering the ""made in China"" sticker, I am amazed that I only just managed to destroy this system. But in a way, this was also a downfall in my opinion. More on that in a minute.-Small footprint. I originally purchased these to install int he sleeper of my Kenworth W900L. A semi notorious for having one of the smallest and tightest living quarters in the industry. The component speakers are perfect for either hard mounting on a wall, or using the permanently mounted feet. If you use them on the desktop, the foot design makes it easy to keep a tape or paperclip dispenser on them. The sub also has a fairly small footprint, and since it is ported and side facing, there are very few limitations on where you can set it.-On one of the satellites, there are stereo jacks for both an extra audio input device, and an output jack for headphones.-Volume and tone controls are very simple, and very sensitive. The included amplifier definitely does what it is intended for!And the cons:-As stated earlier, this is built quite well. So much so that if there is even a small problem, you cannot fix it but must replace the entire get-up. A lightning bolt fried my surge protector, and managed to do damage to the power module of the amp. Because of this, all three speakers are useless now. The amp is coated with a layer of melted glues making it impossible to even remove a chip for any kind of inspection.-the wiring is very poorly designed in many ways.  First, you have to run the obvious power and speaker cables. No problem, right? this system adds in another wire, which in my opinion, is the weak link of this whole package. You must run an extra wire from the primary satellite speaker to the sub, alongside the normal speaker wire. This extra wire is the control tether for the volume and tone controls, nothing more. And when plugged in, it pushes the sub enclosure a few inches out, for fear of crimping the wires. The jack for this wire is also very temperamental. After a few days of use, I would have to sit there and wiggle the wire to get the circuits to close.-The power switch location sucks! The toggle is located near the bottom, back side of the sub. This means that you need to be very nimble if you want to put the box out of sight. The switch is also located right by the above noted temperamental wire, so bumping it out of place when turning on the speakers can be more than a mild annoyance.So, with these things considered, would I buy them again? Probably not this particular design. While I absolutely love the sound quality, I think that the wiring issue and the fact that you cannot do any sort of upkeep is a really big fault. I hate having 3 speakers here that all sound great, but I can't use because of one little circuit board getting fried. I hate having to go out and buy a whole new system because of this. So, for a home entertainment system, in a house I plan on dieing in, I would definitely consider installing a plethora of Klipsch components and speakers. But for anything less, i doubt I will."
1066,2,"Works fine and was at a great price.  If i were to get picky, I'd say the click was a little too loud."
1067,0,Locks up the computer every time I plug it in to a known good port with a known good cable. Support was no help at all.  Returned product.Same with d-link usb bluetooth adapter.  Device drivers would not install and it was an oem of a Toshiba product.I won't be buying any more d-link products.
1068,2,nice producti faced some problems with sync is with more than one flash
1069,0,This was unable to power the IR emitters on a camera at the end of a 250 foot run; ran fine in daylight but no lights at night.  This was with two other outdoor cameras on 75 foot runs.  Sent it back and put my older non gig POE switch in service.  I don't know if the issue is power (15 watts SHOULD have done it) or the algorithm that determines power based on cable length.
1070,1,"It's nice thick wire, but the quality of the wire is still just so/so. I would buy agian at this price. For the price point, I would give it 5 stars but for qulaity I give it 3 stars. I always argue with myself on how to rate things like this (5 stars for price vs 3 stars for quality) but I think most people want to know the quality of the metals in this product, so I gave it 3 stars."
1071,1,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this system is LOUD and has EXCELLENT sound overall.  I'm keeping the system, but wanted to point out a few problems that I see with the design:(1) Contrary to reports saying there is a power button on the sub-woofer (an inconvenient location to be sure), my system actually has NO power button at all.  This means I have to use a power strip with a switch or manually unplug the system whenever I'm done using it.  Quite a hassle.(2) The speakers are nice, but the stands look a little cheap.  Stamped metal.(3) There is a sub-woofer adjustment knob, but no tone adjustment knob.  It would have been nice to design-in a  basic EQ or at least a bass/treble adjustment knob as the speakers are a little bass heavy.(4) The system is made in China and smells as such.  Your house will smell like Benzene for an hour or so.  And you'll have lots of non-recyclable Styrofoam packaging to deal with.(5) Lastly, I don't want to complain, but the speakers are SO loud that you'll often have to be careful to keep the volume knob less than 1/4 of max.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near the computer with these speakers on 10.I'm satisfied with the purchase and performance overall, but I would have been willing to pay double if the system would have had a little more attention to detail."
1072,2,"I don't know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but I'd buy them over again even if they didn't.It's hard to find a pair of in-ear headphones that are rated 16 to 23,000 Hz. And if my memory serves me correctly, this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them. I've always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from them.I've used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last 10 years and have had no problems."
1073,0,"This router would be no stars if possible. I just spent two hours trying every trick mentioned on DSLREPORTS.COM to get this working with NO success. Flashing to previous and newer firmware had no effect. I spoke with a CLEC tech on the other end of the connection who reported fragmented packet errors. Swapping out the router resolved the issue. We were using SBC DSL Speedstream 5100 connection hardware known good, I didn't have another brand on hand to check harware compatability. I'd highly recommend another router...don't venture down this path.Regards,Jeff"
1074,0,"My monitor have some extra usb connections and it uses a male A to male B cable for it, since I moved the monitor far away from the case, I figured this cable will do the trick better than it will to get a usb extension.  Well, it didn't work, every time I connect a usb device to my monitor it detects that something is being plugged but never recognizes the device. I ended up getting that usb extension and it works perfectly, now I'm wishing I didn't waste my money."
1075,0,Had the unit 2 months before one port died.  three months later the unit started producing power irregularities which meant the computer kept rejecting the ports.  Two strikes but I'm out.  Have to buy another unit.  No more D-Link for me.  I've had other gear from this company and find that they don't build stuff for the long-haul.
1076,0,"I have tried for the last 5 months to get Netgear to resolve a problem with the RP614 that I have but to no avail. The unit quits working randomly and requires power cycling it to get it to work again. Every response has been inane, either Netgear doesn't have a clue, doesn't know how to find the problem or simply doesn't care. And the problem has nothing to do with loads as it occurs with one computer on the network. I've also run every type of scan of my computer to be sure it is not a virus, etc and my computer is clean so the problem is with the router. I have a very simple system so the problem is not in the configuration. Now Netgear will not even respond to my support request email, they now required me to register and log the case in as new! I strongly suggest going with LinkSys and that is what I am switching to. This has to be one of the worst customer service experiences I've had."
1077,1,"The first one I received from Amazon was defective.  The clock would not increment, thus I could not set the timer to record programs.  After returning the first one and receiving a replacement, it works flawlessly.  The DVD picture quality is great and the quality of VCR recordings in EP mode is fine.  Only annoying part about the VCR playback is that the first 5-10 seconds are always a bit fuzzy along the bottom of the screen.  The auto-tracking feature has always cleared it up though."
1078,0,"I purchased this item thinking that I could go from vga to dvi since my home tv does not support a VGA input. Well I got nothing, well not to really say nothing but all I heard was a beep like it was trying to work, but then nothing. I tried using this on another laptop that I own and again nothing, I thought it might just be the connection so I just went from DVI to my tv using my other laptop and that worked fine. I for some reason can not get this device to change the signal at all. So like the other person posted this is a waste of money.-AkWingnut"
1079,1,"The Sennheiser HD 202 headphones are decent headphones. The sound is very good, but not quite as good as the bose over the ear headphones. Comfort is the main problem with these cans. Again, I found the bose to be more comfortable than the Sennheiser. But for the price, you can't beat it. If you have the money, go bose."
1080,0,"I would buy this in a heatbeat, but I run both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X (Mass OX)... Unfortunately this only works with OS X...."
1081,1,One channel went out after two months. Didn't do a lot of plugging and unplugging either... oh well cheap enough that I bought a spare
1082,2,"I have owned two units so far and have gifted another one.At $50, you'd be amazed with the sound these deliver. I bought one years ago - and they worked fantastic until one of the side gave out. That was when I discovered the no-questions-asked lifetime warranty from Koss!I mailed them the piece - explaining what was wrong and about $8 s/h. And sure enough in four days they sent me a new unit!For the one I gifted, I was on the fence about beats, sennheisers, and bose on-ear. Tried them all out and personally I think the Koss ones sounded way better (and looked cooler too). I know the bose fans will hate this - but if they closed their eyes and didnt know which ones they were listening - I bet they would agree Koss sounds better or at least as good as the bose on-ear phones."
1083,0,need something thats not going to short out and also give good quality sound through the speakers get something duarable
1084,0,If you like to do a Family Picture with you on it and trying to get on the right side of the picture view - most of the time it will not work (on D90). It won't work from side or behind aether. (Infrared signal have to be directed strictly to the Infra Red sensor area.)
1085,0,"This little infrared remote must be used in front of the camera.  So, its most useful function is taking portraits of yourself.  Hardly worth the effort."
1086,0,"it works, but I have to twist the headphone plug connector when its plugged in to make a solid connection, otherwise the sound is distorted and crackly. would spend a few more bucks for a better quality cable."
1087,1,Bought and returned because my husband didn't like it as much. Not that it's not a great product.. He just wasn't feeling it as we'll as he wanted to for recording.. Says it was too bulky. But other than that it wasn't bad. But returning it was a breeze with no problems.
1088,0,I was hoping this would replace some quirky USB to serial converter cables I was having issues with on my PC.  It was a disappointment.  Maybe serial devices weren't meant to be in 2014 anymore?
1089,1,"This switch works well, but it's too light.  When you want to press any of the buttons, you need to do it with two hands or the switch can sometimes slide away from you.  The weight of the wires connected behind it keep pulling off the shelf that it sits on.  It is reliable and has worked well for the few years I've had it.  No problems to report."
1090,2,"This does the task it is supposed to do. It provides an inline volume control for headsets that do not have one. I realize that many headsets are available that have this built in. However, we have several nice pair of headsets without this feature. Rather than replacing expensive headsets, I bought this to make it easier for me to change the volume without fiddling with controls on the computer or ipod."
1091,2,"Sure, this flash doesn't have all the bells and whistles that a modern name-brand speedlight would have.  You don't get TTL, and you can't swivel the top.However, if you are into off-camera ""Strobist"" type of lighting, this is a nice, cheap flash to use for your secondary flashes.Realize of course there are only 4 power-levels on full-manual.  Full, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/16.  There are no inbetweens, if you want to vary the output on your subject, you either move the flash head in/out or you shoot into a neutral density filter to reduce the output.  Either method works fine.  I also think it's rather weird that there is no 1/8 power, but again, if you have a 1-stop neutral density filter, this is easily achieved without moving the flash.This flash DOES have a high-pitched whine to it that does not go away when it's fully charged.  It's not loud and annoying, but you can hear it if you listen hard enough.Overall this is a good flash that puts out lots of light.  I have heard reports that the newer models being manufactured in China are not built quite as tough as the first release, so you might do well to pick one up used rather than new.  These things are built like a brick, and the older Vivitar 283/285's are STILL working after 30 years, so that will tell you what type of quality this brand has."
1092,2,"Hands down the best sounding headphones I have ever purchased.They really should be broken in for optimum sound though; hook them up to an audio source and let it play through them for about 24 hours.  After breaking in they will sound amazing.I've read quite a few reviews about how some $10 pair of headphones sounds just as good/better and I can tell you that it's crap.  Some people can't tell the difference between bass and quality.  If all you want it bass with no fidelity you'll be sadly mistaken but if you want bright, clear sound with a good range and great clarity, these are awesome for the money."
1093,1,"It doesn't say so in the item description, but even if your laptop accepts pc133 RAM, this module will not work with processors slower than 1Ghz. You have to get their pc100 RAM if you have such a processor. Be sure to check [...] to make sure this module will work. I learned the hard way."
1094,1,Not bad in price range
1095,0,My new lens will not work with my Canon new 7D. It will not screw on properly. I am returning it!
1096,1,"The seller (savewithsteve) is great, got everything on time and as desribed. This feedback is nothing to do with the seller or his service.I think there is a inherent flaw in this product. Although it depends on what you use it for, I would recommend going for Dayton BACT-GRB Banana Plug Pair (Compression Type). If you are thinking of using these in the wall plates which have pin type inlets, let me warn you - They are thicker and CANNOT be used. If I have to just use them in speaker and AV receiver, trust me banana types are much better choice.They are just lying with me now, opened and unused. Maybe I will use them one day."
1097,2,"My very first set of headphones (purchased in 1970) were a set of Koss Pro 4AA.  They were heavy, rugged and sounded great when plugged into my Kenwood receiver. Thirty-six years later, the 4AA's still sound great, but are not at all portable.The earbuds that came with my iPod sound allright, but lack bass response.  I tried a set of Sony EX-51 earbuds.  Better bass, but uncomfortable.After much research, I decided to give the PortaPros a listen.  Actually, I would have loved to have found a retailer who carried the PortaPros so I could listen to them before purchasing, but having no luck at the local ""big box"" retailers, I decided to purchase the head phones via the internet and audition them at home.No dissapointment.  These are a quality set of cans.  Great sound, great price, and a lifetime warranty as well."
1098,2,"A truly fun piece of glass and I use it as both a toy and a tool. I love to shoot people and objects with it and see what the distortion does to the image, but it's also incredibly useful when you have no room to work or back up. I found it especially useful in the confined spaces of aircraft cockpits. But that fine thread to mount it on the camera drives me nuts! Especially when I'm in the confined space of something like an aircraft cockpit. But I always put it in my kit when on the road."
1099,0,"Had for about 2 1/2 yrs. It go haywired last night, flashing LEDs unable to reset. No reset button, unplugged all CAT cables and power supply, with different power outlet with no avail. Never knew an unmanaged Switch can malfunction unoperaterable. 4th product from Netgear made, didn't last from 3mos to 2 1/2yr; however, this switch has lasted the longest. Will stay away from all Netgear's product from now."
1100,0,"I tried this hub for two months with only one printer plugged in (HP CLJ2550L).  After approximately a half a day, the hub ""goes to sleep"" and the printer is not recognized.The only solution I found was to unplug the power supply from the hub and plug it back in to ""reboot"" it.  This is inconvenient for me because I need to have the hub installed behind a desk where I cannot get to it easily.UPDATE (11 Sep. 2008)I replaced the D-Link hub with a Targus ACH82EU 7 port hub.  It has worked continuously for more than 10 days now without dropping any peripherals off-line.It appears the D-Link hub was the problem.  Definitely not recommended."
1101,2,"I got this cord mainly for Macro work so that I could use long Macro lenses along with my flash without having to deal with the lens shadow in the picture.  It is also very nice to be able to control the direction of the lighting by placing the flash above, below, or beside the subject.  Red eye can also be almost entirely reduced by moving the flash further away from the camera body, so this cord is helpful for portrait work.  It could be a little longer, but the longer it gets the more difficult it would be to pack it small spaces, so all-in-all I think they did a pretty good job.  It works fine, if you want all of your flash's functionally, but don't want it in the hotshoe, this is a good choice."
1102,2,Worked as expected. Easy to setup using and following instructions. Use it every day. Its a little long but works fine.
1103,1,"I LOVED this mouse at first.  It's a big improvement over my old mouse that had a ball.  Recently, the side buttons started to lose their programming.  I didn't even change it; I kept the default settings.  Sometimes I find myself opening my mouse software every few minutes to click the OK button, just to make the side buttons work.  I wish I had bought the cheaper one, but I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning this mouse and hooking up another one.I'm adding to this.  I gave away that mouse 2 two years ago, when I bought a new computer.  An optical mouse came with the computer.  I do NOT miss the extra buttons."
1104,2,"The Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel isn't a new product. It was designed sometime between 2000 and 2002, but the box has been refreshed with stickers that show it is certified for use with Windows Vista. It even includes a PS/2 adapter which has become all but obsolete in 2010. That said, I needed a cordless trackball for use with my media center PC so I could watch movies and TV shows without having to grab a mouse pad for my cordless mouse. The pad becomes a pain because it is difficult to use a mouse on my couch. The trackball made a lot more sense. I did however, test this Trackman on my desktop to see how it works in normal usage.First, the maximum effective range was tested to be 15 feet with direct line of sight and no other objects in the way. In the living room, this range was slightly shorter for unknown reasons other than the fact there might have been interference from my Microsoft cordless keyboard and mouse receiver. Even with the shorter range, I had a good 10-12 feet of range.The Trackman module uses only 1 AA battery. I have been using a high capacity NiMH rechargeable which should last 3 months before it self-discharges. I also found that no drivers are needed unless you want to customize the button functions. I just plugged in the receiver in XP and Vista and was using the trackball with ease.The trackball has been around for years but apparently it has not caught on. It's definitely not as intuitive as a mouse, but has its merits in limited spaces or if you don't have a table top surface. Its supposedly great for those suffering from repetitive motion disorders or carpal tunnel syndrome. I intended to use this for my media center PC and not for office applications, but it did take some getting used to especially in photo apps and even web browsing.There's no back button or additional buttons besides the left and right buttons, and the scroll wheel button. There's no tilt wheel function, but this Trackman was also designed nearly a decade ago when such features weren't as prevalent. Another drawback is that it is designed for right handed users only. Southpaws will have to look elsewhere.The Trackman and receiver are large in dimensions. They're not as sleek and sexy as the Bluetooth mice or cordless mice with micro transceivers, but it gets the job done. I can't seem to find many modern cordless trackball designs due to the low popularity of this type of device.Pros: Great for limited spaces, optical technology doesn't require frequent cleaning, smooth ball rolling action, all of the buttons are very tactile.Cons: RH users only, not as intuitive as mouse, no tilt wheel buttons, no back/forward buttons, large unit, and the receiver is very large. The range is acceptable.Overall: 4/5 stars."
1105,1,"I have had these for about 3 years now. The do sound fantastic. I will comment on items others have stated.Very tight on small heads making uncomfortable after 30 mins or so.Tight fit is great for best sound,  but also causes ears to get hot.As a monitor headphone you don't get exaggerated bassI keep mine stored stretched over the top of a speaker in an attempt to stretch them out to lessen the fit pressure. Amazingly they never fatigued/stretched and never cracked or broke.Wear them on a jet plane and you can barely hear the engines.In the end I rarely wear them due to discomfort."
1106,2,"Very good camera bag, my canon xsi feets perfectly. Maybe it should have more pockets. But its very good for tourist traveling."
1107,1,"Periodically makes a horrible grinding noise. It's a mechanical noise coming from the tape deck, not a sound quality issue. Sound quality is a bit muddy and flat, but I suspect it is probably par for the course with a tape adapter. All my mp3s are encoded at various quality levels, so volume fluctuation from song to song is a bit of a problem - more so than when I have used aux in adapters in the past.I actually fixed the grinding noise by tearing the thing open and removing the tape part. No idea why that worked, but it gets the job done now and I don't have to go look for another one."
1108,1,"These will work as advertised as long as you figure out how to position them perfectly and don't need your remote to operate more than a few feet from them. I have one of them facing my cable box from about 15 feet away, then in the next room I have one on my office desk. However, unless my cable remote is less than about 3-4 feet from the one on my desk and pointed fairly accurately at the receiver, it won't recognize the signal. So just be close to it with your remote and it'll work fine."
1109,2,I don't use this frequently but is nice when I do need it! I like that I don't have to pay anyone else to take our pictures when I can pose and do it all myself!
1110,0,"This headphone does cancel the noise dynamically. However, in noise cancellation mode, it generates a static background noise, quite annoying."
1111,0,"I used this headset just one or two times a day.  After only 10 months, the wire that connects the microphone came off so no one can hear me."
1112,2,"I use mine in my car, where the great accessories to power it and adapt it to a tape deck work flawlessly. A good CD-MP3 player is one that you don't notice at all, and for the most part it fits the bill. The sound is great, and I've never had a single skip. The position memory takes off at the song I leave off at when I last park the car, which is really nice.My peeve with it is the fact that it takes *so* long to start up. It does a full scan of the CD, even if it's the same CD that was previously in there. This usually takes between 30 and 60 seconds, which is a big distraction if you're making short trips. It should store the CD ID and song contents in its buffer and only rescan if it needs to. It would also be nice if it had a song title display, but that's not a big issue for me."
1113,0,"As others have noted, this thing tends to lose track of what it is doing and have to be rebooted- sometimes several times a day.Tech support thinks the product ""has a few problems"" but isn't interested in dealing with them...Don't give up your full-time money for a part-time product."
1114,2,"I've occasionally read reviews about these over the years. But I irrationally felt from their appearance that they probably weren't as good as so many people said they were. But indeed they are. As everyone discovers, the experience of comfort and sound clarity in these matters can be extremely personal. On the basis of sheer discomfort alone, I have greatly disliked every one of all the types of headphones I have ever tried- until now. And anything in-ear is much worse. So I have simply been looking for something/anything with decent sound quality that didn't cause my ears to burn and my entire head to ache after 30 minutes. Now the long frustrating quest merely to find wearable headphones is over at last. What a relief!"
1115,1,"great product, and i am still kicking this around but not using it as much as i used to.  i used this for several years and worked like a charm, upgrades are easy.  best feature is that it plays all formats. bad feature is that it's limited storage :("
1116,0,"The Netgear FVS318v3 may seem like a great option for users with the need for many ports, but beware! The FVS318v3 loses connectivity TOO OFTEN. Every few minutes, it seems like, I must reset the router (switch off, switch on) to get it working again.I would NOT recommend this router, because it has one too many connectivity issues.Other than that, the router is great! Port forwarding seems pretty straightforward.So, to summarize, don't purchase this router unless you have around $80 to waste.Don't buy it.It's not worth the trouble.Don't say I didn't warn you."
1117,2,"I use this with my Bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which Is what looking for in this product, the extra cable length is a bonus."
1118,0,"This product is fragile and completely ineffective. I bought two and both fell apart within months after no more stress than simply moving them around. Not only were they fragile but they barely work at all. There was little difference in the quality of the signal received with the antenna than without it. Simple, cheaper, rabbit ears worked much better. This product is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! I have rarely been this dissatisfied with a purchase. I wish I could give it ZERO stars."
1119,1,"I bought this thinking that I would never need another remote control. However, this unit is limited in its functionality. I guess that's why they are stopping production and making the other one. The product is big,  which is a disadvantage. Also the screen is horrible. Unlike the pronto, who's screen is great, you cannot read this screen without the backlight on. Also, I had trouble with my SONY AV Receiver. It took me a while but I finally figured it out. Before I bought it, I thought that its usefullness would outweigh its size, however for me it is not the case. I am not a big fan of the buttons and the size. Also it cannot hold enough macro functions for my system. Like I said before, this is getting a little old for the times, if I were you, I would return this item and get the Phillips Pronto, its 166 online and can never become obsolete due to its ability to update firmware. It's a lot smaller and had a much better screen. If all you need is something BASIC to control your entire system, this is fine, but I would shell the extra 30 bucks and go with the better, smaller pronto. Another thing that I should note, is that the sony remote does not have backlit &quot;hard buttons&quot; (the rubber buttons on the front). The pronto does."
1120,2,"This works so much better than the cheap unit I bought. I should have got this the first time well made and works great, The only issue is the cord is to short needs to be 2 feet longer. One star off for that."
1121,2,"So I loved the one I purchased for home so much that I purchased another for my headphones at work :) Simple, does what it says and a nice cheap price!"
1122,1,"After the numerous positive reviews on both ... and various camera sites, I went ahead and picked up a S200. I've managed to get some good pictures with it, but it definitely is not a good camera for someone looking for a ""point and shoot"" device. Careful composing of each shot is required, as is tinkering with the various settings and modes.For example, on my first outing, I took it to a large aquarium in Chattanooga. When I returned, I realized that only 1 out of the 16 shots I took was excellent; 2 other ones were pretty decent, and the rest were garbage. Not great for a supposedly ""point and shoot"" camera.On my second trip, I spent about an hour with the manual, learning the intricacies of auto focus lock, flash lock, various metering modes, and other features. If I spent a minute or so on each shot, carefully determining the best mode for the situation, my results were much better - 6 out of 8 shots were excellent.If you want a camera for a vacation where you want to snap something neat that you see as you pass by; say, out of a gondola, while on a train, etc - I'd say forget about the powershot s200. If you are looking for a camera to produce excellent ""set-up"" shots, this may be the one you're looking for.Pros:- Great picture quality and color - if you're willing tocompose the shot extensively.- Rugged, fine-looking stainless steel- comes with a li-ion battery pack & charger - good battery life- menus are easy to navigate throughCons:- photos that are ""point and shoot"" are likely to come out blurry or improperly exposed, to the point of unusability.- Camera does not take Compact Flash Type II cards - only Type I- No uncompressed file mode - if you do any cropping / editing on your picture, expect it to get worse each time you resave it.- Focusing is very picky in low-light situations- Price is pretty high for a 2 megapixel camera- lower resolution modes are practically useless; only the ""best"" resolution setting gives quality pictures."
1123,2,"These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too."
1124,2,"THIS IS A SOLID BUY. IF YOU JUST WANT TO POINT AND SHOOT, IT DOES IT WITHOUT A PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT TO BE CREATIVE WITH YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, THIS IS WHERE THIS UNIT REALLY SHINES. YOU CAN TURN OFF THE AUTOFOCUS FOR SHOTS THAT YOU WANT TO BLEND FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND. THE MACRO FEATURE BRINGS THE LENS TO WITHIN ABOUT TWO INCHES OF YOUR SUBJECT. THE 20X ZOOM KEEPS THE FOCUS SHARP ON YOUR DISTANT SUBJECTS. THE MEMORY STICKS ARE GREAT; A 96 MB STICK HELD ABOUT 260 OF MY PICTURES.I ONLY HAVE TWO CRITICISMS. THE AUTO FOCUS MAY TAKE TOO LONG FOR ACTION SHOTS. AND THE MEMORY STICK FLOPPY ADAPTER(YOU NEED ONE OF THESE, A REGULAR FLOPPY WILL ONLY HOLD 4 PICTURES IN HIGH RESOLUTION MODE)TAKES ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS TO RECORD THE SHOT. A LONG TIME IF YOU HAVE WIGGLING KIDS, AND WANT TO TAKE MULTIPLE SHOTS.I STILL WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET ONE OF THESE. IT'LL MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A PRO PHOTOG!"
1125,0,Every one of these I have purchased no matter the brand has gone south after about a year. I keep buying them because I have a split keyboard and mouse pad that only have ps2 connectors. Cannot buy USB models so I am stuck purchasing this adaptor. Ugh.
1126,2,"Best bucks I've ever spend on a portable headphone... Glad I didn't go with Bose AE2... this sounds just as good, just as comfortable, and 1/5th of the cost... Heck, best money I've ever spend on a headphone.Also love the open-ear design, I can finally hear people talking with me at work now :)"
1127,0,"Using Nero, about 5% of these CD-R disks generated write errors.  That seems unacceptably high."
1128,2,"I need to say it up front: these are the ugliest headphones ever. With that out of the way, I can heap mounds of praise upon them.Sound is paramount, of course, and these are no exception. I sort of prefer the sound of these to some of the closed-eard headphones (which I think sound like a cave sometimes). They almost sound good as the Sennheiser 497 (not as good, of course, but still impressively close, given their price).They are exceptionally comfortable. At the risk of sounding corny, they feel like wearing air.They can folded up to very small dimensions, a nice plus."
1129,0,"Just to echo the concerns about a serious problem with WCF12: It doesn't really work with PocketPC 2003.  Yes, there is a beta driver, but it's been in the beta stage for months, with no update in sight.So, look for a CF card that you know to be supported by PocketPC 2003."
1130,1,"I thought this was a great router at first for the price and it used to work well too.  Lately, it's been rebooting itself and refreshing constantly.  Contacted Tech support and had a brain boggling experience from this supposedly technical support guy who didn't know jack.  He kept telling me &quot;No, you're wrong&quot; and &quot;It's the ISP&quot;.  I'd like to think that I'm not your typical user having worked in various departments within IT for over 7 years.I'm the third person I've known personally who's had very similar problems as I have with this specific model of dlink router.  If you're going to buy a router, don't go for dlink.  I've heard some really good things from some of my colleagues about SMC in particular, and also Linksys and Netgear.Needless to say, I'll be looking to buy a new router soon."
1131,1,This mouse is very light and the side buttons are very easy to touch by mistake. The buttons are much too sensitive and I had to disable the right one due to constantly touching it by mistake. I finally returned it and found a heavier mouse with side buttons higher up and also cordless.
1132,2,Everyone is surprised by the awesome sound when I have them listen to these. I use them regularly at the office as well as when I travel. They collapse well for travel.
1133,2,I have this trackman as well as the new wireless optical trackman.I found this one easier to use with the ball controlled by the thumb and the rest of the fingers are nicely placed on the primary buttons.The optical trackman on the other hand uses your fingers to move the ball and your thumb to press the buttons.I think the best combi would be the wireless trackman with a few more buttons . So i guess we will have to let logitech take it to the drawing board to come out with a 5 star trackman.Jeremy
1134,2,This works great. I have a MP3 player that I use when I am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume. Fast shipping.
1135,0,"If I were you, I'd wait before buying this or else look to another 802.11g vendor.The problem I have is that if I reconfigure the device via the web interface (say, to change the password or SSID) then the WAP dies. Wireless seems to still work but I can no longer connect to it via the LAN port. Hard reset is the only fix. I suspect this is a simple firmware bug (v1.05), but it's a good reason not to buy the product.The other problem is that Linksys support is awful. The website doesn't even have support pages yet. Calls to the 1800 number indicate &quot;heavy call volume&quot; no matter what time of day or night. Their email support guy in the Phillipines ignored my detailed request for confirmation of this bug and just gave me the generic &quot;reset your device&quot; instructions. Not helpful."
1136,1,"It does the job ok but the wire material is not great. I was constantly losing a few strands during the connection project. I used banana plugs (GLS Audio, check out that review). Then I needed more speaker wire..........this time I decided to check out the Radio Shack Brand. Theirs is much better. Their wire material is really solid. I never lost a single strand. I would still recommend this product. However, the fact that I was losing a few strands all the time is quite annoying. I dont know if this affects sound quality. The sound seems to be ok."
1137,1,I gave it as a gift. But I did see it in action and very impressed. The quality and setup was well worth it. And very satisfied.
1138,2,"This bag works well with our Canon EOS Rebel T3i camera. We took it on long treks through Petra and other parts of Jordan among other places. It's a bit bulky, but i think that's going to be true for any camera bag cause the camera itself and a couple of lenses are a little bit bulky. I felt like it provided great protection for the camera and lenses though."
1139,2,"I bought this cable release to use with my Nikon D300 and theCustom Idea GeoPic II - Direct Connect Geotagging GPS Unit for Nikon & Fujifilm Digital SLRs.  The Geo Tracker plugs directly into the 10 pin connector of the Nikon - which blocks using the normal Nikon cable release.  However, the GeoPic has a connection to add the Canon or compatible cable release.  The combo works great together.Bill"
1140,2,"Hey this flash it is so powerfull, it is good to use to make jobs outside, and it is not heavy. you can use on the Canon Rebel XS,(1000D).also you can buy an extra battery holder, and four AAA to AA battery holder converter, and make some wiring and use an external battery 6vdc(lead acid) and have a better recicling times, like 6 seconds using the full power of the flash against the 12 with the normal four AA batteries. and with the lowest power you can shot continously like 20 times without problems. with this add, this flash can work all the night and take more than 1000 shots.cons. If you need to take fast pictures, with it mounted on  the camera shoe, you need to adjust it every time , because it does not have TTL circuit, and you can burn the pictures. and for this reason it is better to buy the TTL flash of your camera to avoid this kind of situation on fast moments taking pictures, like the kiss on the wedding ceremony.but for the rest it is a good flash.i do recomend it"
1141,2,"For the price this tripod is tall, holds heavy cameras, moves smoothly, and is stable with over 5 pounds of camera and lens (6D + 70-200 2.8 II) on it, even for windy night shots on a mountain top. It's light enough to carry hiking, and it's got indoor and outdoor feet built in. It's got the bubble level and adjustable friction on the fluid pan/tilt mechanisms. It's stiff enough to be used as a periscope with a 3lb camera attached (grab all three legs together with two hands and hold camera up over a crowd).It survives a lot of banging around and the head is solid - but after dropping it from hand height onto the concrete one of the leg extension locks broke. They have some strange tiny pieces of plastic inside- seems unnecessarily complicated and flimsy. I replaced it with parts ordered on the phone from velbon. Two years later another one broke - I think the airline smashed my luggage that the tripod was in.So here's the three issues that make it short of perfect:Leg extension locks should be redesigned without tiny flimsy plastic parts inside.It isn't as light and compact as some tripods are.It's cheap but not free.So handle with reasonable care, buy a spare if you're a pro, and enjoy."
1142,0,"The item would not work, or pass power from one side of the unit to the other.  LED indicators did not power up either."
1143,0,"I was previously very interested in this camera.  However, after using it for a time, it has been very possibly a nearly useless camera.  The autofocus is poor at best, the movie is only 320x240 max, and less than 30fps.There is also a considerable delay in taking pictures, as the autofocus has a meeting someplace inside the camera to discuss if there is any point in focusing on anything in particular!There are many better choices, not to mention the Finepix S7000!"
1144,2,"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the plastic is fragil and if you push to hard when installing it can crack pretty easily.  Other than that, it's a good product for a great price."
1145,2,"I've read many reviews of PortaPro and have done some research for this headphones and other competitors like Sennheiser and AKG. I have to choose one of them because of limited budget haha. I chose this one because of my friend. He has Koss SportaPro which produces great sound and incredible bass. That's what I want. I'm very pleased with PortaPro. Very nice high and mid-range sound and impressive bass. I didn't say that this headphones are the best because some people still like Sennheiser or AKG. I think it is not much comfortable even if you adjust it to comfort mode. Moreover, even if you fold it, it's still bigger than pouch included in package. However, I chose PortaPro because of sound (and price). If you like powerful bass headphones and very nice high-range and mid-range sound, PortaPro will make you happy."
1146,0,My voice crackles on the other end. I tried with the boom mike away from my mouth and directly in front of it. Microphone is of poor quality
1147,0,"I installed the BEFCMU10 with the WRT54G Router on my XP desktop, which went without a hitch. The problems started when I tried to use the WPC54G notebook adapter on my laptop, which was also running Windows XP. According to the installation instructions, I was told that everything should work without the installation disk if I was using XP. That was not the case. As soon as I placed the card into my computer (HP ze4101), it froze. Restarting the computer did nothing. My first call to customer support revealed that I needed to update the drivers.Once that was done, my laptop did not freeze, but now it would not communicate with the router. A call to customer support showed that my adapter was assigned ""a bad IP address"" and they gave me a number to manually enter. Apparently, this is a common problem...so maybe it would have been a good idea to put something in the installation instructions.After correcting the IP address problem, the card would connect for about 2 minutes then drop the connection, despite being about 3 feet from the router. Another call to customer support, and about 30minutes later, I was told to return it.Once you get the replacement card working, it is not so great either. My router is in one room, and when I am in an adjacent room, I can surf the net for about 10-20 minutes before I lose the connection. I have not been able to surf for longer than half an hour. I remove the card and stick it back in and it usually picks up the connection again. Annoying.This is the only notebook card I have ever used, so I don't know if the others are better. But installation should not have been this problematic."
1148,1,"These sound incredible.  I have had my set for 2 years.  Today the amp died.  A check of many online forums indicates this is nothing new.  In fact, many people experience the same problem at right around the 2-year mark.  So, if you want to spend close to $400 for speakers that sound wonderful for about 2 years, you can't beat Klipsch.  I however will be giving some Logitech Z-5500s a try..."
1149,0,"As others have mentioned - either D-Link changed the product without changing the Model, breaking compatibility in the process, or these have a high defect rate. Tried it with Ubuntu 12.04, Mac OSX 10.7.8, and pfSense 2, all of which other earlier reviews mention working ""out of the box"". I can only conclude that the device is defective, or something changed with newer units. Either way, it's going back to Amazon to sort out.  Off to find a different one that works..."
1150,1,"I keep buying this keyboard, as it's so comfortable and easy to type.But, the cheap ink they use on the keys slowly erodes away!This is the third keyboard like this I have purchase and they all loose ink on the commonly used keys of E, D and C.I even see gouges from my finger nails in the E key. Must be soft plastic they use.Great for typing, but you had better be good at touch typing, because after a year of moderate use, you will have no labels on common keys."
1151,1,Check with your ISP (Mine's comcast) before purchasing!  Their website should have a list of compatible modems!  This one is not compatible with Cocast Colorado!  I found out the hard way~
1152,2,Easy to use.  I would recommend this product over other products.  It was cheaper online than it was at the store.
1153,2,Definitely one of the best sounding headphones under $50! Well worth the money. Just that it might pinch your hair.
1154,2,"I really can't add more than others have written.  Yes, I got my hair snagged the first couple times.  Once I figured how to take em on and off it's been no big deal.The sound quality is fantastic.  Bass is present in spades.  Highs are well defined and haven't gotten tinny on me.  I'm not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows I want.  Comfy too.  To the point I despise putting buds on when I workout.  May get a 2nd pair just for working out.  This is one product where the reviews on Amazon are dead on.Can't recommend these highly enough."
1155,2,"Got my first pair around 10 years ago, loved them then and still love them now. They fit and seal well, block as much ambient noise as safety ear plugs, and they sound awesome to me. I use them with a sansa clip zip at work 12 hours a day 6 days a week and they are comfortable. They require less volume to be used than some competitors brands(saving battery life) to reach a desired level and will certainly go loud enough to make you deaf if you push them. Using the sansa's equalizer allows me to adjust the levels to fit my music and tastes to a sweet sound. I listen to mostly hard rock, classic rock, country, and some blues and I find that while maybe they aren't audiophile quality they are really good for the price."
1156,2,It works clean and prefect. What else can be said but get it.
1157,0,Photos are great even in low light.  I had mine about a year before the auto focus stopped working.  Even when it did work it was really sloooow.  This lens is plastic and cheap.I'm now springing for the 1.4 (metal) version.
1158,2,"Although the eTrexes were really designed for use in the outdoors, I use it in the car to help predict distance to go, etc., and if I have the local map downloaded to it, it has helped me out of binds on a couple of occasions.  If you use it in the car, you really want this adaptor to save your batteries.Not only will it save the batteries, but I can operate my Legend in normal mode to get better position from the WAAS data. (Battery saver mode precludes the use of WAAS and normal mode can really drain the batteries rather quickly.)  (BTW, there is no scientific reason for reception to be better because of using this adapter.)The cord is generously long.  In fact, it can get in the way sometimes, but may allow the unit to be passed to the back seat so your back seat navigator can monitor it.I have only two minor complaints.  The first is the price.  The Garmin Legend gives a lot of feature for the price, but Garmin seems to make up for it with the price of the accessories.  It seems this adaptor should cost half what it does.The second is that the fuse is accessed by screwing off the center of the cigarette plug, and the center piece has unscrewed itself on a couple of occasions now, leaving several small parts strewn about.  I had to dig in my glove compartment this weekend for all of the little parts, and am waiting for the day I lose one for good.  So be careful that the center is always screwed in.I use this with the suction cup mount, which works quite well on glass. (But again, seems kind of expensive for what it is.)"
1159,2,"I'd been looking for some comfortable, affordable headphones that provide great sound and came across the reviews for these Koss PortaPro Headphones. The reviews do not lie...these are absolutely perfect for my purposes.I use these with my MP3 and PMP players, as well as my Blackberry Curve if I'm listening to music on it, and have found the sound to be phenomenal.  Now, I'm no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones I've owned so I'm very happy with them.  They are also extremely comfortable...I needed some over-the-head phones because I've always found earbuds and over-the-ear phones to be painful after awhile (I wear glasses, which are a definite factor).  These have been very comfortable on my ears and I can wear them for hours.  I have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention, so I've been lucky with that as well.Definitely worth the price, and if they ever break down I know Koss will provide me with a new pair.  I know they may look a little strange, but I've never had people comment on that - they just want to know if they are good and what kind they are.The only con is I wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer - not a lot, but just a few inches to provide a little extra give.  However, most headphone wires are WAYYY too long, so this is a very minor con.These are not noise-cancelling phones, and they were not purchased for use on planes (I have some foam ear buds I use for that purpose) so I can't comment on how they would work in that situation - I think too much noise would definitely get through.  So just use these in everyday situations (walks, in cars when others are driving, etc.) where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposes.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyone."
1160,0,I put this on my camera.  Loved it at first...now it is having trouble focusing.  I want it to be able to shoot for me through out a 2 hour session and it will give me 1 out of every 5 pictures that aren't blurry.I'm upset cause it was a &#34;good buy&#34; but now its not performing the best. :(
1161,2,"I bought the Ebookman for $40 a few years ago.  The unit is just small enough to fit in a shirt pocket but large enough with 3 font sizes to read. The mp3 music sounds good for me but it was meant more for audio books.  I would prefer the backlight to be brighter. sure it uses batteries even while off and if they die then you WILL lose all data. I never had a problem with that because I use a multimedia card that has the entire system backed up. it's easy to backup daily.  I use NiMH bats.  When bats die I pop in fresh NiHMs and the unit automatically restores the system with all the data. It's a great deal for $40.  Mine is still working after 4 years of use. The pen does lock in so I never lost it.UPDATE 19-June-2014  I stumbled across some files for the ebookman on my computer and thought I would reread the comments about this reader. It still works well and all info is still on my MMC memory card.  The screen is almost 5"" including the write area.  I still think it was a great buy for $40.  Most of the negative reviews were people who never bought a cheap memory card for it or never backed up the system on their computer. Even though Franklin has stopped supporting it years ago it can still be used for reading books or listing to Audible books and it is better for reading outdoors in bright light than current color tablets.  With no wifi, it takes much more effort to load books onto the eBookman but still can be done.  I no longer use it since I have a few tablets that read epub and Kindle books right from the library."
1162,0,"Purchased this a month ago and have been rather unhappy with this product, which gives unstable wireless performance.I was attracted to Netgear by the rebate, and now I regret it.  I should have bought a Linksys wireless router/AP instead, I think.My wifi-ready laptop is about 50 feet away from the Netgear router.  There are about 4 walls in between, and reception is poor.  About 20% of the time it's fair, 30% of the time poor, and 50% of the time (when I try to use Internet) it's unavailable.  This performance is just not acceptable.The manual set is also poorly written.  You get two pieces of printed materials: a confusing starter sheet, and an ISP information sheet.  Get this: on the printed &quot;get started&quot; sheet it asks you to refer to the manual on the CD-ROM before you should turn your PC back on!  What kind of genius wrote this?  Luckily I'm a techie so I had no trouble deciphering the non-English guide.The router's major strength is its cool design, but its poor signal strength means you should probably go with a more established brand like Linksys or D-Link."
1163,1,"MONSTER - VERY MISLEADING AGAIN!!!!This time they put 100 feet on the packaging and in fact you only get about 80 feet.ALSO, in true Monster fashion, they make the cable LOOK thicker and of higher quality than it really is. It looks like really thick gauge wire, like 12 or at least 14 gauge, when in fact it's only 16 gauge wire!! Don't use this for long runs, 25 feet at best!! Lots of clear plastic insulation and a very thin wire were it really counts. People must be catching on to Monster and their selling tactics and that's why this wire has been discontinued."
1164,0,"I have a wired and wireless networked SOHO. I used the NS108 to replace a NetGear 10/100 hub that was working fine. The reason for the 'upgrade' is that a month ago I developed a need for large file transfers from 3 computers that were plugged into my hub going down one CAT5 wire to my server room to a NAS box. The problem was the hub was getting almost constant collisions when I'd try and communicate with the NAS simultaneously on more than one computer on the hub. So, I thought swapping the hub out with this switch would solve the problem (I also had 2 other NAS boxes off the hub, and a printer).While the NS108 switch took care of the data collision issue, I've actually seen my network file transfer to the remote NAS box DECREASE versus the hub I had been using. The worst problem I'm encountering with the NS108 is that its method of throttling multiple computers trying to use the same pipe appears to be to dedicate virtually all the bandwidth to the first computer that tries to access the remote NAS box. WTF? That doesn't solve my problem, it makes it worse. Now the situation I end up with is if I try and access the remote NAS with more than one PC at a time, the 2nd and following PC connections hang. Not only that, but those machines can barely (if at all) access the Internet or anything else since the data connection needs to travel from the switch across the same pipe to the server room.I am going to experiment with running at least one more CAT5 line from the GS108 to my server room to see if that helps, but at this point I am very skeptical. I'm annoyed that I can't change the behavior of the switch and that it appears to be optimized to favor a single connection to the switch communicating with a single other connection on the switch. What I wanted was a device that would load balance like my hub but more intelligently handle the traffic in an effort to avoid data collisions like what I was seeing on the hub. Yet what I have now with the GS108 is worse. I didn't get time-outs and apps crashing with the hub, just slower throughput for all connected devices. But that is better than what I have right now, which paralyzes part of my network when a large transfer is initiated from any one device on the switch. Very annoying and counter-productive.I'm now looking at the TP-Link giga switches, which are the only brand I've found so far that supports 10/100/1000 transfer rates on ALL ports for the price."
1165,0,"We bought this camera because we wanted a nice small digital to complement our large Sony Mavica with a 10x optical zoom.  The camera takes okay pictures - I cannot really complain or boast - but there are two things that make this a camera to stay away from:FIRST, the Secure Digital memory never worked.  We bought a 64 Mb card when we purchased the camera, and the camera never recognized it.  Retruned it to Amazon and got another - also didn't work.  Returned it and bought a third brand at the local Staples - also didn't work.  Kodak tech support said we needed to download new firmware for the camera (which was a big pain in the 'dupa' to do, but we did it), tried the SD card - same results.  Basically, unless we ship it back we are stuck with a camera that can only take 15 pictures.SECOND problem - the engineer who developed the battery door should be shot.  It is extremely hard to close, and within a month ours had already broken after changing the battery only twice.  We were patient and gentle with the battery changes - the design of this should never have gotten through their beta tests with this product.Overall, we are pretty disappointed."
1166,2,"After using the m100 for about a week, I can say I'm still very happy with it, and I do tend to be very picky when it comes to gadgets, being an industrial designer bu profession. The looks are definitely cool, much nicer than than Palm III and light years ahead oh the Handspring; the unit is also infinitely cute. Actually, I have to admit I chose this device over Visor mostly based on the looks :) It is very comfortable to hold and use, also to carry around, being very light. Despite the weight and all plastic construction, the unit does feels solid. My biggest remark on the build quality is the flip cover connection to the body, which both looks and feels weak and cheap and I did completely loose the cover couple of times just by opening it. The display is indeed noticeably smaller than other Palm models (well, comparing them side by side) and if you have problems reading small letters it can be quite a disadvantage. I personally find the size adequate, even for AvantGo browsing and the docs I have (mostly reference and dictionaries, books I still prefer in print). Readability is very good with soft, overhead, even light (outdoors, in the supermarket type conditions etc.) but sometimes the display surface has a nasty glare and the faceplate thickness shades the edges, making some parts hard to read. The backlight is useful only in VERY dark conditions, otherwise there is just not enough contrast to read the display. Memory is small, but if you're planning to do lots of work on your Palm, like spreadsheets and such, you will anyway go for a bigger display (and thus more memory of IIIxe or Vx). I have all my  contacts, business and personal (about 200 so far), couple of months of activities, several nice games and necessary documents (and ok, two books just for the fun of it), Avantgo with 5 channels  and still some 500 kb left. Btw, there is a memory expansion advertised on palm.com, a 2 MB backup module, with 8 MB coming soon from the same company. So on the long run you'll be able to expand if your needs grow. (As I understand, it is not the same thing as the Visor flash memory module, but some swapping needs to be done; still, if your life is so busy and fast paced, you are probably making lots of money and can get a second organizer, like Vx or Sony Clie). Finally, I wasn't so bothered by the absence of the HotSync cradle. My desk is way to cluttered anyway, so the cable does the job. Also, as a Mac user, I had to invest into the USB cable (-), which works without a glitch on G4/ OS 9.0.4 (+)"
1167,2,"I like to tune everything else out and just hear my music when I listen to my music. These work perfectly. The fit will be different for different ears, I actually turn the foam around to stick the bigger side in first. Once they seal, I get deep bass, clear music, and isolation from outside noise, so I don't have to listen to them as loud to get that ""my own world"" feeling.Only drawback, they do wear out. I've gone through 3 sets in about 4 years, first set the foam wore out, replaced just the foam then the foam piece would keep falling out. Second set, same thing. The third set is the only one that actually broke. I use them to work out, and one of the cables started to go, the one side would turn on and off depending on how you moved the cable.For the price, if they only last a year, it's still worth it. Sound quality is great, Isolation is great, and I've returned $100 set's that promised ""Amazing deep bass"" that didn't even compare to the base I get with these."
1168,0,"I have the PX 100 too, I guess I prefer the sound of the PX 200, but just a little. Better bass than the PX 100, less clarity.One of my ear pads (""cushions"" according to Sennheiser) fell off when I pulled the headphones out of my jacket's pocket.Sennheiser asks for $7.21 for replacement set, plus $5 shipping, plus tax. Total $12.79. Too much to spend just to get these headphones back up and running. Hence just 2 stars. PX 100 has better value, 4 stars."
1169,0,"I bought the MR814v2 abotu 2 months ago.  It has recently completely stopped working.  If i unhook everything and power cycle my modem, the router works again for about 3 hours and then it dies again, permanently.  As if i couldnt tell the shoddy quality of this thing just from pulling it out of the box and looking at it, it's performance has sealed netgear's reputation of making complete trash.  It's worth spending more to get something that actually works.  I plan on throwing this out my car window at a very high speed."
1170,1,"I'm sure there are audiophiles who will love the HD-212 headphones but these are not for me. The bass is overwhelming and tends to wash out the treble and midrange. I tried comparing this set to my 8-year old Sony MDR-V404s and the Sennheisers were no match in terms of balance, smoothness and comfort.For pros, I have to admit the noise reduction capabilites are terrific. I can't hear anything from outside, even with the sound turned fairly low. The cord length is generous, and using this to watch movies never sounded better. Supposedly you can remove the cups and the cords, but that was never an area of my concern.For cons, I have several considerable complaints. One, these headphones are just not comfortable for me. The closed cup design is a tight squeeze on my ears, and I can't listen to anything for more than an hour before I start feeling burdened by the pressure. The bass, often overexaggerated on classical/pop and downright deafening on electronic/trance, starts to give me a headache before I'm done with one CD. The worst thing is how most music in my collection is not properly balanced. I have to do major tweaking with an equalizer before I can get vocals to comfortable levels. Again, midrange and treble suffered a tremendous distortion at the expense of booming lows.Granted this set was really an experiment for me; this is the first time I've tried Sennheiser and a closed cup design. Unfortunately I can't say these headphones won me over in either category. I'm returning these to Amazon and going back to looking for another Sony to replace an already proven winner."
1171,2,"Had these in college in the early 2000s and now again a decade later. Kind of a cult following of audiophiles, fashion lovers, and retro freaks back then and now. Great punch and bass for a small and simple headphone.  Very good price from Amazon for $30ish vs. Msrp $50 or even higher for limited edition colors or cable volume control.  Great alternative to ear buds or full cans, somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so I would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage. Obviously not closed so neighbors will hear your music at louder volumes. However this isn't a problem in louder public venues like the bus, subway, airport, train stn,etc."
1172,1,"I bought these because they were cheap and they are single-pull -- the wire is on only one side.  They lived up to those two requirements.  The cord is a little too short.  And it's not that loud even at the full volume.  I think the volume control hurts the signal even when it's turned all the way up.  Given all that, they're cheap and do the job."
1173,0,"See the &#34;Cat 5 Ethernet Cable adapter&#34; review.  It was either that one or this one, I never received.  The one I did receive came directly from Singapore and fell apart.  I used Super Glue, then it worked."
1174,0,"These batteries work great.  They last a long time, hold their charge well, and they supposedly can be recharged a thousand times.  But there are two things I don't like.First, just like all rechargeable NiMH rechargeables, they only supply 1.2V.  Most electronics will work fine with a slightly lower voltage, but devices which require more than 2 batteries can have more trouble.  For example, my thermostat at home requires 3 AA cells, and actually does require closer to 4.5V (what you'd get from three 1.5V alkalines).  The 3.6V from a trio of 1.2V NiMH cells just doesn't cut it, so I still have to buy alkalines for the thermostat.The second problem with these batteries is specific to Duracell-brand rechargeables.  I get that ""the copper top"" is their trademark, but unfortunately the big ribbon of green around an otherwise normal-looking Duracell AA isn't enough to catch the attention of a casual user.  We've had a couple sets thrown away by employees or friends who didn't realize the cells were rechargeable.  I think the labeling should be made much clearer.  The label needs to be completely redone to make these look like they're obviously not your normal Duracell alkaline AA cells.  Perhaps the whole label should be copper, or the black should be replaced with another color and the word ""rechargeable"" should be even bigger than ""Duracell.""  Purely because of this confusion, I probably won't buy any more Duracell-brand rechargeables, because I can't afford to have them mistakenly thrown out at a cost of about $2.50 per cell.  Other brands' rechargeables, such as eneloop and Energizer, look much different from typical alkalines and are less likely to be mistakenly thrown out."
1175,1,"I have been following Olympus's cameras since the D-360 and D-450 came out, and had been waiting for them to release one with a certain feature set.  I wanted 2 megapixels, USB, and a reasonable price.  The D-520 has that, and unlike its predecessor (the D-510) it is pretty compact and runs on only two AA batteries, not 4.Finally, receiving my tax refund, I decided to break down and buy a digital camera.  There were really three contenders in my mind:  The Fuji Finepix 2600Z, the Olympus D-520, and the Canon Digital IXUS 330.  A friend of mine highly recommended the Canon model, but its list price was [money], which was out of my price range (also, nobody had it in stock).  So for me it came down to the Fuji and the Olympus.  I ended up going with the Olympus because a local electronics retailer had it for [money].The camera itself is pretty simple to use.  It has four quality settings: 640x480 (sq1), 1024x768 (sq2), 1600x1200 low (hq), and 1600x1200 high (shq).  While some Olympus models I've used previously allow saving as a TIFF, with the D-520 all of the pictures are saved to the camera as JPEGs.  This is a shame, because it means you are stuck with the camera's JPEG quality level.  If they had allowed you to save as TIFF, you could easily set your own JPEG compression level in photoshop.That is part of the problem I have with this camera, and part of the reason I only gave it 3 stars.  The picture quality is not that great.  The camera seems to have an extremely difficult time focusing in low-light situations, even when the flash is used, and the pictures come out very blurry.  I played around with some of the settings, but I can't seem to fix this.  And even in bright sunlight, I find images taken with the camera not to be very sharp at all.  Also some colors seem to bleed: I took a picture of some flowers in direct sunlight and the picture came out as some pink and red blobs, losing all the detail of the flower.  I tried adjusting the white balance, but it didn't seem to help.The camera does take some nice pictures too, however.  Pictures of people come out very nice, and since I mostly take pictures of people (at family gatherings, etc), and not scenery, it's an OK camera for my needs.The USB connection is extremely handy, and in my opinion, the best way to access a digital camera's files.  My girlfriend's brother has a smartmedia floppy adapter, and that is extremely slow.  With the D-520, I simply plugged the USB into my computer, and my PC (running Windows 2000) recognized the camera as another hard drive.  I then simply copied the files over.  The camera comes with some software for editing pictures and stuff, but I haven't bothered to install it.  I don't believe that Windows 98 will allow you to simply plug in the camera and have it recognized as another hard drive, you probably have to install extra drivers.Battery life is OK; I have rechargable NiMH AA's, so it's not something I worry about too much.  The fact that it only takes 2 instead of 4 effectively doubles battery life over most cameras, in my mind at least.The included 16 MB Smart Media card can hold: 99 pictures at SQ1, 58 at SQ2 (my preferred size), 33 at HQ, and 11 at SHQ.All in all, it's a decent camera for the price, but don't expect perfection."
1176,0,I bought this so i could have an internet connection with both my xbox 360 and my computer. but even though they were both plugged into this only one would have the internet connection. kind of pointless to have 5 ports on this if only one thing is going to keep the internet connection.

1178,0,"As with most Sennheiser products, the sound on these inexpansive headphones is very good. But I would be reluctant to purchase again for a teenager for an upgrade on an MP3 player. The connection of the headpiece came aprt quite easily for an on the go teenager."
1179,0,"MICROSOFT USUALLY MAKES TOP DRAWER STUFF. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THEY MADE THIS PIECE OF, (I'm not allowed to use that language in a review). This thing just doesn't work right. It's supposed to have multiple buttons that are programmable with different compatible programs. The right click button was magnifing instead of the depression of the wheel and though the right click could be returned to default with the programming options, the wheel could not. This is suitable for TRAP SHOOTING. Throw it into the air and go BOOM!"
1180,0,"I've had two of them in my lone home LaserJet. Neither lasted more than 18 months, and the last required a cold reset of the printer a couple of times a week. Both the printer and JetDirect have to be reconfigured after each cold reset.Since it was not completely dead, HP wouldn't replace or repair it under warranty -- but they did generously offer a trade-in for $249.99, plus tax.For the last 2 years, I've been using a cheap Zonet TCP/IP print server which is small enough to fit inside the printer and plugs into its USB port. You can't configure the printer over the LAN like you can with the JetDirect. But temporarily connecting the printer directly to a computer once in 2 years to run the HP config utility is a small price to pay for increased reliability. Problem free, and you can buy six of them for what this costs.JetDirects have nice configuration tools if you're managing a lot of HP printers over a network. But they're otherwise troublesome and overpriced. 615Ns, now discontinued, are notorious for a high failure rate."
1181,0,"I bought the for an old 2000 computer.  It said the hard drive is new.  Apparently, mine was manufactured in April 2002.  I bought it sometime in June 2013.  So you might not get a new hard drive.  I used crystal disk info t check the health status. It's in good condition but it ha about 35000 hours on it. It's also kind of loud, but it works so I'm happy with it.Update 7/7/14:The hard drive gave me the click of death.  I expected this to last longer than a year, despite its age.  I am now disappointed in this product, and would never recommend it to anyone unless they like dead hard drives."
1182,0,"I'm not the type of person who is picky about sound quality, so I figured it wouldn't matter if I got cheap speakers. Boy, was I wrong. These buzz and aren't even worth listening to. Their best feature is the blue LED power light. You'd be better off plugging a pair of cheap dollar headphones into the back of your computer. You've been warned. I wish someone had told me."
1183,2,"This is a great little bag.  My Nikon fits lens down in it, and there is just enough room around the edges and top to squeeze my tamrac strap in as well.  For the most part I don't attach any straps to the bag and just carry it by the handle.  Since it's inexpensive, I also purchased the chest strap, which holds the bag snug against your chest but makes it very easy to retrieve the camera without removing the strap.  Although I've test-fitted the chest strap, I haven't taken it on a hike yet so I don't know if I'll like it or not.I held back a star, probably unfairly, because the fabric of the bag seems a bit thin and unexceptional.  I don't think this is a performance issue at all - I just would have preferred something thicker and more tactile, like ballistic nylon."
1184,1,Bought this to clean the power to my sub-woofer that was experiencing some interference due to an error made by the in-wall installer.  Seems to work reasonably well but no evidence that the power curve is significantly cleaner.  Difficult to incorporate into a wall plug behind a couch because it sticks out quite a bit so had to improvise with a power strip.
1185,2,"After reading some of the reviews having to do with MacBooks and this item warping the plastic, I was skeptical.  Since the combination lock versions seem to be incredibly unreliable, I decided to give this one a try, it being a reasonably priced lock.  I haven't had any problems with it so far, using it everyday for about 2 weeks while at work.  It is very easy to use. The only thing you have to make sure is that the main flat part that goes into the slot lines up with the prongs that are on either side. Its sort of hard to explain but once you have it in your hand you will see what I mean.  Once the prongs and flat part are aligned, the lock fits easily into the security slot.  Just give it one good quarter of a turn, and your mac/pc is safe.  I experienced no warping of my MacBook casing, in fact there is a little rubber part that separates the metal lock that the key goes in from your mac, preventing any sort of scratching. Overall a good lock at a reasonable price."
1186,2,"I was a little leary of buying one of these because I was spoiled by having a 5Meg camera for 2 years, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the battery life is much better than I had expected for an optical zoom camera.  That alone made me very happy.  The pictures are acceptable at 2 Megs and as long as you aren't looking for perfection, they are good enough for most applications.  Finally, it is relatively small and light and easy to carry around.Drawbacks, the software included isn't intuitive at all.  I wasn't even sure if I had installed the correct program.  The camera menus are also a little hard to understand unless you read the manual a couple of times."
1187,2,"I have three of these and I'm pleased with them. I leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel. These are light, and simple to operate. No complaints. I've used the Kensington brand laptop cables for years - I think since they first came out. I lose them periodically but keep buying more. I highly recommend.As a bonus, it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security ""hole/notch"" so you can secure these with the security cables also. Very nice. My new Seagate 500GB FreeAgent does for sure but I've seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as well."
1188,2,"Got this mouse for my Husband's new computer because he had a similar one that finally died.  This isn't the one I use, but it's easy enough and he loves it.One thing that can be said for Logitech.  They give you a great warranty, five years on these products I think, and IF anything goes wrong they honor it immediately.  They are great to deal with."
1189,0,I bought this antenna base on all the good reviews I've read. Big mistake! I couldn't get any clear channels from this thing. My unpowered rabbit ear out-performed it by a mile. And the size! it has the wing span of an albatross. Total waste of money.

1191,0,"To anyone I led astray w/my original review - I apologize.  When I wrote it I loved the Tungsten T.  There are better quality PDAs out now that are comparable in price to Tungsten T.It still has good qualities: a good screen, good maneuverability and good processing speed.What it doesn't have is good support.  Around month 10, I started having issues with a shift in the keyboard.  Type 'k' and you get a 'j'.  First it was only w/the right side of the keyboard....then the left.  Then it switched:  Type 'j' and you'd get a 'k'.  Completely screwed up.The odd thing is - I ended up getting used to typing that way.Redigitizing helped for short periods of time.  Maybe 1/2 a day.  But always it would go back to being f***ed up.  The Palm site had a patch that worked for about 10 minutes.  Reading on-line, this was not just my problem - but fairly wide-spread.Palm was of NO HELP.  I had no 3rd party software loaded onto my Tungsten - so that wasn't the issue.  To have Palm &quot;fix&quot; it - I'd have to send it in, which was a difficult option.  Try to fix it yourself and you violate the warranty.I ended up buying a new PDA (which I'll review after a sufficient amount of time in using) and giving my Tungsten way to someone whom was going to attempt troubleshooting."
1192,0,I used films on two different types of Palm PDA before.  Those were custom fit type.  This one needs to be cut to size and very difficult to apply.  The film is thinner than the ones I use for Palm.  It is easier to tear and difficult to get rid of air bubbles.  I use this on the LCD screen of a digital camera.

1194,1,"I was very pleased with the sound quality that these cheap cans were able to reproduce, but unfortunately the headband is so tight on my head (I have a large head) that I will have to send them back. Seriously, they hurt after just a few minutes, and they press directly on my ears. Perhaps if they were circumaural (i.e. around the ears) I might be able to tolerate it, but the pads press directly ON the ears, and it hurts, as well as warms up my ears. Taking them back."
1195,0,I bought these because of the over ear design.  They were cheap so i gave it a shot.  The sound quality is horrible. Cheap earphones will sound like cheap earphones. There's also slight hiss coming from the earphones even when the music is paused. Don't waste your money on this.
1196,2,"Just received this lock. First impressions are good, the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product. The key is big and easy to locate. The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched (not really a concern on *this* laptop).I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device. There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off. Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop. The Kensington slot is right by my system fan, which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air. The metal lock gets very hot. Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves.It's no secret that cable can be cut, the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it."

1199,2,"Great little item.  Clips to the Canon camera strap so there's less chance of losing it.  I purchased this remote at the same time that I purchased my XTi/400D.  I was familiar with this RC1 remote from previous use with my Rebel XT/350D.The RC1 remote has the same problem with the XTi of not being able to trigger the shutter from behind the camera.  I'm not sure why the eye proximity sensor next to the XTi viewfinder isn't used for the remote IR also.  I use the remote mainly just to ensure that I'm not in contact with the camera/tripod during the shutter release.Overall, this is still a very great item.  For night shots, I secure my camera on the tripod, set up a decent shot through the viewfinder, and then stand to the side and use the remote for three or four shots (holding the remote near the front of the camera)."
1200,0,"I bought this intending to plug it into my computer.  No, it doesn't fit those ports.  Fortunately there is a proper jack on my desktop phone, and the product works with that. So, not a total waste."

1202,2,"This player does what it's advertized to do. It plays CD's, and it plays MP3's on both CD-R and CD-RW media. Sound quality is excellent even with MP3's. Much better than the dismal sound quality of the similar, but less expensive, MpTrip player that I wish I hadn't purchased and now sits on a shelf gathering dust. That said, here's what could be improved: 1) Include a carrying case, or at least offer one. I searched the entire Amazon site and couldn't find a case for the player. Only generic cases that were too bulky to be useful since they accommodated a number of CD jewel cases in addition to the player. If you use MP3 cd's the one in the player and one on the side would do. One MP3 CD-R encoded at 128Kbs holds 150+ average length song titles. 2) Enlarge the display and show me the MP3 track title, not just an arbitrary number. The data is on the MP3 cd, let me see it! 3) Ship the player with rechargeable NiMH batteries and allow them to charge while the player is plugged into AC power with the included AC adapter. I know you can buy NiMH batteries and chargers as a separate item from multiple sources, and I did. But it would be nice not to have to physically remove and replace the batteries everytime they are discharged. Battery compartment lids on these products aren't the most durable part of the device..."
1203,0,"Ordered this printer in January.  I was very happy with it for a few days.  In february, after very little use, it begin to jam every time I copied or printed.Called support and after trying for hours to solve the problem, Kodak agreed to send me a new printer.  True to their word, the new printer arrived in only 2 workingdays and I returned the old ones in the container provided.  The new printer worked very well, for several days.  Then  after hardly using it for a month or so, .....the same thing all over again, jam after jam.I am currently trying to decide if I want to go through the various attempts to make it work or the task of sending for another and packing this one off.

These sound excellent, usual Senn quality, but the pads are just a little too thin to lift the innards of the cup off the ear, and the ""innards"" are hard--so after 30 minutes, ears are saying please reposition these headphones.  After an hour, hard to tolerate for any more until after a rest. The sound is robust, I just wish the over-the-ear padding was too."
1206,1,"First, I can confirm that the actual product does not look like what is pictured in the official Amazon photo, as the wire now has a bright, continuous white line on the jacket of one of the wires.  The other wire includes occasion black printing ""RCA 14AWG SPEAKER WIRE"" on it.Second, I can confirm that the product is copper clad aluminum, not copper.  If you look carefully through all of the reviews, you will note that the earlier iterations of the RCA speaker wire used to be 100% oxygen free copper.  Not any more.  Apparently with copper prices skyrocketing, it was no longer cost-effective to provide 100% copper wiring.  Now, I'm not one of those audio enthusiasts that insists higher end wire sounds better, however, it is known that aluminum wiring has almost double the electrical resistance of copper wiring (recall Ohm's Law where voltage = current * resistance), so achieving consistency of your wiring is important).Third, this wire is much more rigid (like thick lamp wire), in contrast to earlier versions of the true copper wire, which was much easier to bend.Is this wire sonically inferior to the earlier wiring? I cannot say, but for other reasons, the earlier wiring was easier to work with, and was just worth more.  However, you can get other 14awg lamp wire or speaker wire for much less (e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-RSW14100-Gauge-Quality-Speaker/dp/B0007DBBJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327474157&sr;=8-1) so this wire is no longer a good deal in its copper clad aluminum iteration."

1209,0,"I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE."
1210,0,"This item performed as well as expected--it really makes any photograph look professional. I ordered it upon recommendation of a pro photographer, and it delivered as well as he said it would.However, when I opened the box, the item did not look like it was in its original packaging...Not sure if it had just been opened before or used. I wasn't able to send it back though, because I needed the lens the day after to shoot my friend's graduation pictures.Soon after, my camera began to malfunction, and the autofocus couldn't get a clean read...it just kept moving, trying to focus. Same thing with my other lens. One place suggested that I clean the contacts of the camera and each lens...it was really dirty. My old lens wasn't dirty at all, but my new lens was, which in turn made the camera's a little dirty.Everything works fine now, and I'm happy with the lens overall--I just don't like the idea that I paid full price for something that was probably used (hence the 3 stars instead of 5)Edit 6/3/13:I am beginning to have the same problem again...it keeps trying to focus--you can actually see the lens focus turning left and right and left again...again, this doesn't happen during live view. I'm knocking it down another star (from 2 to 3)."

1212,2,"The Pentax K-x (and Pentax SLRs in general) are small.  With the 18-55 lens and lens cap & filter on, this Mini camera bag is a tight fit.  You can't really use the inside pocket in the lid, because it makes the compartment even smaller.Pros- compact, well padded, great price.Cons- I question the use of a zipper on the ~4""x3"" lid flap (even though it's covered with a quarter-sized leather flap). It's just one more thing that can scratch your viewfinder over time.  (most of the 1-star deduction is due to the poor implementation of this storage feature)- hard to get my K-x camera in it in a hurry.  The camera strap needs to be carefully put in around the edges of the camera for the top lid to close...  It's hard to avoid scratching the viewfinder with parts of the strap.- for the K-x, only the outside pocket of the holster is useful, not the lid pocket.Given the small size (mostly height) of this holster bag - for arguably the smallest SLR camera - it seems this bag was designed - and is more suitable for - the ""super-zoom"" - SLR-like style cameras that are generally not as tall from lens to viewfinder.This is a great bag for a not-too-expensive SLR if your camera fits, with the caveat of that semi-exposed internal zipper.  I wouldn't put a $500 or up camera in it.Update: 3/6/2010:  I decided to move up one size larger to theLowepro Topload Zoom 1 Camera Bag (Black)bag.  The specs say it's 1.25"" taller and a bit wider than the Mini.  But, having both side-by-side, and because both are wedge-shaped, the Zoom 1 is *noticeably* wider and taller than the Mini.The result:  The Zoom 1 has at least 1"" spare room at the top with my Pentax K-x inside (w/18-55 lens) and at least 1/2-1"" more  side-to-side for the camera strap.  Ahhh...Also, the LowePro Zoom 1 bag has 2 1"" -removable- inside Velcro'd straps at the top of the bag to stabilize the camera position.  The LowePro Mini does not.The Velcro strap feature makes the Zoom 1 a much better choice than the Mini for securing your mid-priced SLR, and is worth the extra buck or two over the Mini."
1213,2,"I purchased the lower end version of this product, the TV Wonder VE. It has met all my needs in a TV Tuner card to go in the PCI slot of my low-end emachine.My emachine did come with a ATI video card, so I think that  made it really easy. It also accepts composite input, something I haven't  tried yet.Had a minor audio issue with this product. Called support, got  a stupid person once, helpful person the next time I called.Overall good  product, I assume the regular more expensive product is even better."

Unfortunately, my experience is that people sound &#34;tinny&#34; to me, to the point where it is difficult to understand them. People I call also reported that I sounded like I was in a tunnel, and they couldn't understand me. I recommend searching for something else. Only redeeming qualities are that they are comfortable to wear and inexpensive."

1217,0,"Here are a few thoughts I had after wrestling with this junk for 90min:Maybe the ""smartwizard"" should be called the ""dumbwizard."" ""Updating settings"" takes an insane amount of time, much more so than similar products from dlink and linksys. When I first found that no manual was in the box, I thought to myself ""Oh, I see netgear is trying to save money by not printing the manual."" I later found out that the manual is not even on the CD - you have to connect to the internet to get to it. In the setup wizard, I was first prompted to set up an internet connection before using the router. Well, isn't the point of this to get an internet connection?Netgear put an obnoxious red label over the LAN ports telling me to ""STOP"" and use the installation CD. Now I have sticker residue all over the back. Using the CD probably made things even worse than if I would have manually set it up from the get go.There's no information in the box that tells me what the router's IP address is and the password. Reading the manual, it wants me to go to routerlogin.net to log in, a shameful cover up for 192.168.1.1 (which I found out is the IP addy.)Grrrr.... I'm trying to configure the router right now, and I have to wait for the ""updating settings"" even more! This is extremely slooow[...]The ultimate test of a router - if, fresh out of the box, I plug a DSL modem and another computer into it, do I get internet? This router FAILS the test.Now I see the setup wizard. I wonder if that helps? ""Detecting connection type on internet port"" just runs over and over and over, but now it says I have a static IP?? Grrr it says to powercycle the modem if that's the case so I'll do that...Happy happy happy I am connected to the internet but I'm still plugged directly into my DSL modem, now let's trying plugging everything into the router and go from there...What is this madness??? The internet light is still amber!! And what? Only one computer can access the router at a time!!Now I can't even access the router.Well, after an hour of fiddling around with configuration settings, this router is going back to the store. It definitely takes the cake for being the absolute dumbest router I have ever worked with; everything is automated and wizard infested. There is little hope for manually controlling this router; it has assumed from the outset that I, user, am dumb, illiterate, and know absolutely nothing about computers."
1218,2,"i had the very same remote but it was sold earlier along with my rebel.  i was very happy with it at that time.  it was simple, it worked and it was relatively in-expensive.  just bought it for my the 5d mark ii and it works well and meets my needs.  someone must have good reasons to pay more for a wired one but i certainly don't at this point of time."

1220,0,"It's very simple: if you want a great wireless desktop solution, but don't give a hoot about Bluetooth connectivity, this is the product for you.  If you want to ever connect to anything else via Bluetooth, don't even think about it.I have done hours of Googling looking for a solution to this problem, but have come up with the same result everywhere I go: the Microsoft BT dongle is virtually useless outside of communicating with the mouse and keyboard (and maybe a printer).  It seems that many people have had to buy a BT dongle from a 3rd party and throw away the Microsoft dongle.I feel extremely betrayed by Microsoft's claims of connectivity with this set-up.  I just bought a Sony Ericsson T616 with BT, and can't use it with my computer.  If you want to connect a phone, don't buy this product!!!"

But, it sure would give Sony more favorable talk on my part if they just included the cable when I buy the camera."

1225,2,"I had a pair of Sennheiser headphones that had about a 100 dollar price tag that broke.  These were around 30 dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money.  Granted I think the Sennheiser were a little better, but you cannot beat these at this price point.  They defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well.  Where I think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange, and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones, but that's expected at this price."

They work very well with an iPod. The bass is especially good, and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal iPod earbuds. These earphones are well worth the money."
1229,2,The flash works great. It's simple and basic in function but has everything I need to shoot on and off camera. I hardly use on camera flash (unless I want or need to) and primarily use it off camera with a shoot through/bounce umbrella. I plan on buying another one to set up with a large soft box. It's plenty powerful for a variety of occasions. As a mobile set up and until I get strobes these will work fine!

1231,1,"The Riot seems to be very well made, and it has worked flawlessly for me for three weeks.  It replaces a 6 Gigabyte Nomad Jukebox.  Compared to the Nomad, the Riot is more convenient to operate (the jogwheel is nice, and much quicker than Nomad's buttons), has a better display (bigger font than Nomad) and a mostly better file management system and both loads and turns off much more quickly (a big plus).  The included FM radio is a big improvement over the Nomad, which has no radio.  The 20GB drive is a huge improvement over the 6GB on the Nomad or the I-pod (though Creative now offers a 20GB Nomad with similar capacity). I like the case (which has a belt clip, and permits access to the controls) and, unlike other reviewers, I am not especially bothered either by the Riot's size (bigger than I-pod but on a par with Nomad and Archos) or by its use of USB 1.0 instead of much faster Firewire.  Sound quality is as good as the Nomad (which is fine), and the player may play just a little bit louder (which is better).  Unlike the Nomad, this player doesn't record, and lacks a separate line out jack for use with a home stereo (though I think you can use the headphone jack as an output jack with the proper cabling).Two big gripes:  The software on the player does not permit you to create a &quot;single use&quot; playlist of songs by various artists.  If you want to turn the player on and listen to songs from multiple artists, you need to create such a list, you need to name and save it, before you can play it, and I find this a frustrating timewaster.  My second (and bigger) gripe concerns the battery: it is built-in and not user replaceable, so you can't carry a spare battery as you can with the Nomad.  The fully charged battery powers only about 1/2 of the ten hours of use its supposed to provide, which might not be enough for some users. Finally, the player comes with multiple warnings against (1) recharging the battery before it is fully drained, or (ii) leaving the player plugged into the charger after it is fully charged.  Because the battery status display also is not very finely calibrated, I feel that I need to pay way too much attention to battery charge status.  This can add up to a big problem if I know that I will want to use the player for several hours on a given day.  For that much use, I need to start the day with a fully charged battery.  To do that, given Rio's warnings, I must remember to leave the player on all evening the day before, to make sure the battery is fully drained and ready to charge so that I can plug the unit in at bedtime, then get up in the middle of the night to unplug the unit and guard against overcharging.The Real Jukebox software that you load on your pc for use with this player seems inferior to the Musicmatch based software that ships with the Nomad Jukebox, especially for organizing files and editing mp3 tags.  I don't know whether you can effectively substitute either Musicmatch or Windows Media Player, but its worth investigating.  I know that you can not use Windows Explorer to move files back and forth from the Riot to your PC, as I believe you can with the Archos.So, all in all, I'm glad I bought the Riot instead of the 20 GB Nomad.  But only a little bit."
1232,0,"Reception was excellent, but in less than a year I had to purchase a replacement.  Not recommended."
1233,1,"This light works just fine I guess, but not the greatest I've ever owned. I broke rather easily when the camera was dropped, so that's why it only gets 3 stars."
1234,2,"Once I figured out that I had to hold the remote off to the side and to the left of the camera (facing me) in order to get it to work, it worked fine. Might have been nice if the instructions included that little tidbit of helpful info, since I thought the thing was broken when I tried to use it with my right hand and it only worked one out of 10 times."
1235,2,"I have used this for many pictures, especially images where I either wanted to be in the picture or images where the natural shake of my hand would have caused blur.  My only complaint about this is that the distance from which you can take a picture isn't very far (MAYBE 10 feet?), and you always have to have the remote right in front of the camera and aimed right at the lens (which causes you to look unnatural in some photos).  Overall, a good product."
1236,1,"I really wanted to like the new Zaurus.  When I finally got it from Amazon, I must say that I was trully dissapointed.  My wife has the HP Jornada 568 and I have a Palm m505, so I'll compare the the Sharp to both.PROS:- hidden keyboard- mostly nice software, with a lot of applications built-inCONS:- screen :(  It is very unevenly lit, actually has a bad dark spot in the upper right corner.  Mine also has a dead pixel.  The screen isn't very bright, and definitely lacks contrast.  The Palm is darker, but has better contrast.  I can use both the HP 568 and m505 at work without the backlight under the office lights.  The Sharp becomes very dark.  I basically have to run it at 100% backlight all the time, whereas the HP is on at 40%.  Also, the Sharp screen seems a bit muddy.- battery power... or lack of it.  The HP lasts over twice as long on one charge, with using 100% backlight.  The Sharp seems to be actually worse than the old iPAQs...- it is pretty heavy and feels a bit odd in a hand.  Like a small brick.  The HP has a much nicer feel.- the casing has a cheap finish to it.- The software is still not very polished, with many very small buttons that are hard to hit, and cluttered.  On a scale of 1 - 10 as far as interfaces go, the Sharp is a 6, HP is a 8 and Palm is a 9.  It would be wonderfull if you could  combine all into one...All in all, a nice first try, but I'm shipping mine back."
1237,0,"I did not buy a fax modem card with my new Lenovo Windows 7  work station.  I loaded it with memory to run high end business applications.  I attached a nice Fujitsu scanner that interface very well.  I figured that a fax/modem PCI card would be great.  Just scan the pages and launch the fax software and woosh off it goes.  Well, not exactly.  Comparing it to my 8 year old Canon L170 fax machine the computer modem is like a snail.  The time it takes to send a fax via the computer is like quadruple the time, approximately a minute per page.  A 6 page fax in 6 minutes, not exactly Olympic speed.  Plus keeping a fax line open for 6 minutes is very difficult and often the fax transmission fails.  If you want to receive faxes via the fax modem open all the time the computer must stay on 24 hours a day.The card was inexpensive so I am not going to return it.  Plus there is some value if I want to send a PDF as a fax and save printing it out and faxing it the conventional way.This problem may be the extra processing that the computer must do to send the fax.  I cut the down the scanner resolution to reduce the file size but it did not make much difference.  The address book is nice with the system making it easy to pick out frequently used numbers easily but this does not make up for the slow speed.With Windows 7 the instructions clearly state to run the CD software first and then insert the modem/card in an available PCI slot.I have other Trendnet products like fast Ethernet switches that work very well.I think if you still need to send/receive many faxes stay with a good brand fax machine like Canon."

1239,0,"Size and weight are nice, and build quality is fine.  However, where it really matters, these headphones are a disappointment.  They do not fit well on my slightly larger than average head, and don't sit well on my ears because the pads are too small to sit on the bumpy surfaces of the ear.As for sound, the headphones are too prone to tinny clicks and fuzzes that I associate with ""blown"" speakers or headphones.  If you are listening to a lot of downloaded music, you will hear these defects very clearly with these phones, even when they don't appear with other ones.  I am going to replace these, even though they're less than a year old, with another closed-design, probably the Koss."
1240,2,"Nice bag, Carry's my camera with standard lens attached and my telephoto. Pockets work for smaller items like filters and manuals. Sturdy, seems like it should last. Easy to carry along with shoulder strap or handle."
1241,1,My subwoofer (Athena AS-P400) has the inputs for a Y-adapter to be used if wanted.  I have always connected a single subwoofer cable to the subwoofer.  The Y-adapter was priced really well and I was curious to see if it would make my subwoofer sound any better than it already did.  I was not able to tell much of a difference in subwoofer sound with the Y-adapter connected.  This may have had nothing to do with the cable but with the subwoofer.  The cable itself seemed well constructed and good quality.  Maybe it will work better for some other people's setups but did not for me.
1242,0,"I simply hate it.Every 2-3 hours I have to reboot it.Also I upgraded it through internet to the latest firmware.Is it something else or the modem itself I can't tell, but with the same line and PC there were no such problems.All I have changed besides the modem is the router, a D-Link DGL-4500.Before that I used the 2wire 2700HG-B worked GREAT ...Well, I simply don't recommend it."

1244,0,"I got this router when out company switched to VPN for remote desktop connections to increase security. This is one of the worst routers I have ever used, and I returned it to Amazon after about a week. The longest uptime I have ever seen was about 12 hours. Their support was horrible, and told me that they would not support the product at all if I upgraded the firmware from their website. I have since switched to netgear VPN routers, and those have been up for about 2 years now. I used to recommend Linksys, but now I tell people to stay away, or carefully check the model and version number, and compare them to the reviews."

Good protection for any of your mid sized digital SLR cameras or smaller models with room to spare.  I've had lots of camera bags for much more $$$  but this does the same job for a great price.  Can't go too wrong with this item.  Buy one and save yourself the time and trouble of looking at more expensive bags that aren't any better.RCB  Oceanside, CAOoops!

Then I have to reboot.Sometimes I have to reboot three or four times before the thing works right.  What's up?  I dunno.  I'm not a newbie.  I've tried a variety of fixes, including reinstalling the driver, unplugging the USB cable and trying a different slot, and standing on my head when inserting the cards.  This device is not reliable.When it does work, after two or three reboots, it works just fine.Try a different brand."
1248,2,"I'm not sure why people are complaining about this backpack being so small since the description and pictures are accurate (though it looks smaller in real life and the scale is not all that obvious).I easily fit a medium sized camera with a 28-300 lens attached and and an 18-55 lens directly below it.  I don't have other lenses to fill up the side partitions of the main compartment, but could easily fit 2 to 4 more lenses (depending on size) in these areas.  The sides of the main compartment seem a bit tighter to fit things in, however.Even being conservative, this pack should fit a camera with lens attached, 2 additional lenses and a flash in the main compartment.In the smaller front pocket I fit 2 memory cards, compact lens cleaning kit, larger lens cloth, 8 AA batteries, compact charger.  A mini-tripod or compact water bottle would fit in the outside pocket/strap.Don't expect to carry huge amounts of additional things in this pack aside from additional small items like keys, wallet, map, cell phone.You're not going to be putting your thermos, picnic lunch and jacket in here.  It's not even as big as most computer backpacks, but it certainly doesn't claim to be.  You might fit some small additional items, but not anything bulky.The construction seems good and it's reasonably rigid and well padded.  It's a good value for the price."
1249,2,"Product seems well made, although you can't stop anyone who is determined to bring the necessary tools to cut the cable. Hopefully it will slow someone down, or at least keep an honest person honest."
1250,2,"As one reviewer pointed out succinctly, this is a deterrent. Get up and leave your  laptop for a few minutes, this lock makes a good deterrent from the casual, opportunity-driven thief. No, it won't prevent someone vandalizing your laptop. No, it won't stop a thief with a good cable cutter. So if you see anyone at the cafe or library with a cable cutter, think twice. Oh, you would anyway? I thought so. Some reviewers here must think you have no common sense.  So let's assume you do. You're considering this one because it's a very AFFORDABLE deterrent. Another Kensington with an alarm may appeal to you if you want wander a few feet out of sight of your laptop, and want an audible alarm if someone tries to yank it off -- but then, who in their right mind will try to defeat a laptop with an alarm in a library? It's all a matter of risk assessment. If you think you may be leaving your laptop in a place where passersby possess industrial-grade cable cutters or the knowledge to defeat alarms, then perhaps you don't want to leave our laptop at all.So this affordable little cable is a suitable deterrent where you feel it's appropriate for the risk. A relatively benign public location ... your place of work where your laptop isn't accessible to anyone but employees and staff ...  a hotel, where only the staff have access to your room. These are places where the risk of theft is minimized, and this easy-to-use cable lock is probably quite appropriate."
1251,1,"I've bought this several times and what can I say.  It works, so you really can't complain because it doesn't cost alot for this and I would recommend having a backup or two in case the adhesive gives out.  This also depends on the size of the lens cap you're placing it on so within reason, 58mm or less works great. I had them stick on for quite sometime and if it does gets loose, use a small strip of gaffer or electric tape.  Sticks right back on.  I did however tested it on larger filter sizes such as 72mm and I could say that they won't stick on very long.  It stuck on for at least several months and gave out."

1253,1,"Although I enjoyed my Sony CLIE N760C for four days, and agree with many of the good points that others here have mentioned, I must add my two cents of caution.  It is a smart looking piece, the MP-3 player works nicely (very sweet sound) and for the most part well designed, but....1- The jog dial is too far down on the side, making it difficult to use, and the back button is below it, making it impossible to use your thumb to click it (unless you are double-jointed)2- The screen is beautiful in the bright daylight, have never seen anything like it. However it is against a grey silver reflective background. (NOTE: all the product picture have a simulated (and unrealistic) screen shot.) The front light is fair to poor. My old Palm IIIc is about 2-3 times brighter, so if you really want the resolution, I guess it's a fair trade-off. By the way the screen is about 10% smaller.3- The Palm OS and CLIE bundled multi-media software works at high resolution, few other apps take advantage of it. If you need reading glasses to read, the thin, and elegant font will challenge you.I am (reluctantly) returning mine because the protective flip cover keeps popping off. I called Sony and they could not replace this simple part! (After being on hold for 25 minutes, and another 20 to resolve the issue.) They could not exchange, nor send me a new flip cover! I was so disappointed that I figured if anything major should happen, I would be in deep trouble. They did offer to give me a full refund though, I will pay for shipping it back.If you must have hi-res and a MP-3 player or/and if you have good vision, don't mind a not bright screen and don't care about customer support, then this is the machine for you."
1254,0,the only reason im putting this as 1 star is because it didnt fit my camera! i dont know how to tell what lens fits on what ir what size to get
1255,2,"Ive had this camera for 9 months, and I have grown very attached to it. I've beat the crap out of it and it still works fine, a good sign.It fits in ones hand like a crazy optical-recepting hand gun.  After time and experimenting, one grows accustomed to its grip and it's small size makes the human subjects less nervous, almost as if no video camera is there, just a miniscule receptor of their realtime image.If you have a friend with one of these too (Scheeronious), you can firewire the 2 cameras together and do some improvisational editing and recording of footage, easily.infrared night-vison, with &quot;old movie&quot;  to make night shots mystical... overlap fading face-morphing,  Luminscennt effects. Manual exposure adjusting to tweak the lighting, in conjuction with slow-shutter surrealism.  &gt;&gt;&gt; The camera give you a lot of room to play.I use the memory stick all the time to capture stills off my prerecorded footage.  I like the small 640x480 jpegs, its easier to work with in photoshop, transfers quick, save-em-stright-to-floppy or email-em size.  If one really wants high quality pics one has to capture the live still straight to the stick. raltime capture even makes a simulated digital &quot;cli-click&quot; sound of an SLR camera when you hit the photo button.  Sony style at its best.This camera is great on an airplane, to watch all your old movies in-transit, and catch stills off of them.  If you really wanted to, you could easily record tv, movies etc.., and watch it on this camera on the plane almost like a MiniDVD player.Problems: 1. You can't use fader and digital effects at the same time. 2. You can't activate digital effects with the LCD closed. 3. The built-in microphone doesn't pick up low bass frequencies real well. 3. upgrade this camera with a wide angle lens, and extended life battery, and 32 meg stick.  Wide angle is a must, it creates a more immersive viewer experience."
1256,1,This was an ok first zoom lens purchase. Ultimately I wound up buying the Sigma 18-250mm F3.5-6.3 DC Macro OS HSM Lens within two weeks of purchasing this Nikon 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF Nikkor SLR Camera Lens.
1257,2,I put this on a 2012 JKU for offroad use. It's perfect. Small footprint inside the jeep but the mic pics up well and the speaker is plenty loud. Be sure to match this with a quality antenna (I used a 4 ft firestik) and GROUND it. I mounted with a RR spare tire mount and have a SWR of 1 to 1.1.I bounce around a lot with this setup off road and never had issues.
1258,0,"Did not fit my head properly -- the speakers hit just below my ears, even adjusted to the smallest size. If your head is average or above average size, should be fine."
1259,0,"I am impressed by the brightness of the lens. large aperture. I have to make many more attempts. Very lightweight and fits well with my Canon T3i.BUT came with a manufacturing defect, a small point inside the lens, it is impossible to clean inside.So far I have not noticed this defect in the first test shots but it is terrible that an original canon lens has manufacturing defect. unfortunately  I live outside the United States and I brought it to me by mail, I can not return it and wait to submit another by distance and the cost of bringing a package to Ecuador."
1260,0,"I bought this card reader to use with my laptop so I wouldn't have a USB reader hang off the side, just waiting to get broken off.  To my disappointment, this reader is incredibly slow.  Slow enough to make it not worth the money, no matter how little it costs.Here's some specs on my analysis:* Test was performed with a Dell Latitude D630 w/ Intel Core2Duo Laptop* Memory card used was a Sandisk Extreme III 8GB Compact Flash* Transfer of thirty-six (36) 10.2 megapixel images (~4MB each), total size of ~160MB** From D630 to Extreme III CF card via PCMCIA, the transfer took approx 5 minutes** From Extreme III CF card to D630 via PCMCIA, the transfer took approx 4 minutes** From D630 to Extreme III CF card via generic USB 2.0 reader, the transfer took approx 20 seconds** From Extreme III CF card to D630 via generic USB 2.0 reader, the transfer took approx 20 secondsJust consider, this was only 36 photos (~160MB total).  If I travel with my laptop and take hundred or thousands of photos and needs to backup or download them, I would most definitely need to bring my power supply.  And when you travel, bringing more stuff to weigh you down is the last thing you want to do.So, with results like these, its clear why I'm in the process of returning this item.  I hope you all think twice before ordering this reader."
1261,1,"These headphones perform wonderfully, especially considering their low price. I have listened to rock, pop, country, and classical music, and these phones have sounded great in all genres. However, after extended wear, they began to cause me outer ear pain where my ear touched the interior part of the headphone. I have since switched my primary headphones to the Sennheiser PX100."
1262,0,"This is a KNOWN FAULT of this controller that it DOES NOT WORK with optical drives.  It *ONLY* works with hard drives, and promise doesn't let people know this ahead of time!JUNK!  Stay away!!"
1263,1,"The motion sensor works like a charm, but it needs to have some sort of dial for adjustable range and sensitivity. It could also use a silent mode where the receiver's lights flash with no alarm sound for when I'm working right next to it and can see the yard through the window."
1264,0,"The cable box I'm trying to control is in my bedroom.  I use an RF converter to feed the signal from that box back into rooms of the house that don't have a cable box.  But even from the room right next door, the remote won't work reliably.  Yes, there is a closet between the two rooms, so the signal has to go through two interior walls (with no plumbing or wiring within them).  But still, this is a distance of less than 18 feet.When you add to that the fact that there seems to be no way to control any but the most typical of functions (for instance, it won't control the DVR part of the cable box), it's pretty much worthless."

1266,0,"I got it to work on XP, but never in VISTA.  It always tells me that I need a new driver despite just loading it.  It seems like it doesn't see it.  So, the bottom line is drivers can not be loaded.Cold Eyes"
1267,1,"I bought 2 of these bad boys but I had to return one.  The one I returned had a big dent on the top of the case (maybe I get the Dickenson's one... see their review).  I thought I could live with the dent but about 8 days later, I no longer got video signals no matter what I did - neither switching discs and cables, pressing the I/P button, nor swearing at it helped any bit.The 2nd one is still working fine (knock on wood - 10 days and counting) and plays everything I throw at it!  I would have given this player a full 5 stars based on value and supported formats/features but my experience with the first kinda spoiled it for me.A couple of side notes:1) If you're using component video cables, go to setup and change your video setting if the video has a red/pink tint to it.2) The burnt plastic smell and the buzzing from the disc tray is unfortunately a normal thing..."
1268,2,"With all of the hype related to these headphones, I was expecting to be let down in some way at the very least.  However, after many months of use at the office, I've come to believe that these headphones are really something special.  It's hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensive/lightweight product.  They are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone, but they really shine when plugged into my laptops(with beats audio and without).  Solid, but tight bass, rich mids, and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that you've been listening to for years.  Do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair.  You won't regret it."
1269,0,wrong plug for my computer..makes it worthless to me
1270,2,"these babies sound pretty sweet for $12! Don't waste your dough. Get these, and turn DOWN the bass on your iPod (set EQ to electronica), they'll sound frickin sweet!"
1271,2,"I like the colors and the small tabs, but I thought they'd be smaller.  Add to that fact that they're only grippy on about an inch at the end and they're best for larger cables.  They definitely won't work for ear buds or small, thin cables as they're far too large for that use, which was my primary plan when I purchased them.  Instead, they'll be used to organize power cables under and around my desk.  Which is not a bad use and the color coding is nice, but that wasn't my intent when I purchased them."
1272,1,"Just got these, and don't really care for them. They sound OK, and I guess you get what you pay for. They sound a little boxy and heavy on the low end to me. Certainly usable though....not a bad sound."
1273,2,"I was looking for headphones that I could be comfortable with for long periods of time.I use my mp3 player for listening to audio books, and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears.  I also didn't want to spend a fortune.After much looking I decided to give these a try, and they have worked out great.  They are comfortable for as long as I wear them which has been many hours at a time.The cables are too long, which seems to be the case with any heaphones I've seen, so that's something to live with. For the price I don't think they can be beat."
1274,2,"If you plan on taking any photos requiring longer exposure times (particularly ""bulb-mode"" photographs in which the shutter remains open until you close it), you need this accessory for your camera.Though the cord is shorter than would be desired, a quick trip to any electronics store should provide a simple solution in an extension: a 3/32"" stereo extension cord, or a 1/8"" cord with adapters to 3/32"".  As these can be had for well under $10, you can easily extend the reach of the shutter release beyond what Canon provided."
1275,0,"You a taking a big chance with the TERK TV5 (discontinued by the mfg.) especially if you need the ability to switch between the antenna and cable or other video input, and/or you are not in a very strong reception area. The antenna/video switch failed completely in 11 days. The unit no longer has any continuity to the coax input, no matter what you do. It can still be used as an antenna with the gain turned on and all the way up. That is, IF YOU CAN PLACE IT IN THE RIGHT SPOT and POINT IT THE RIGHT DIRECTION. For a unit that is supposed to free you from those constraints, it fails miserably and produces all sorts of interference and snow if the location and direction are not perfect."
1276,2,"Using it to hold a Panasonic 54"" Plasma TV. It is very low profile, looks great and is rock solid even with a large flat panel, doesn't tip at all. Well worth the money."
1277,2,"Over the years, I've not had the best luck with portable earphones. Tired of the awful sound of default earbuds, I've experimented with Shure, Bose, Sennheiser,Klipsch, andJVCbrands, ranging in price from $25 to $100, but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too bass-shy, too muddy, or cramped soundstage. Eventually, I got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of on-ear portable phones. Reading at Head-Fi about theKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones, I ordered them from Amazon. While no match for myAudio-Technica A900x headphonesat home, I was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the KSC75s, but it wasn't long before I found the clips uncomfortable for my ears, so after a couple of months I went ahead and ordered the KSC75's big brother, the PortaPros.I couldn't be happier with my decision. The sound signature is very similar to the KSC75s, but there is a touch more bass and depth. It's not a flat, analytical sound, not too muddy but very fun and warm -- perfect for portable listening around the office. They're open phones, so you'll be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what you're listening to at high volumes, so bear that in mind. Build quality is fair, about what you'd expect for the price range, but the PortaPros are very light on my head. Considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of $100 earbuds I've used, I'll take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality. I'm also a fan of the 1980s styling.They're not perfect. In addition to the openness and build quality, the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two, but it doesn't happen often enough to be burdensome. While the PortaPros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball, getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit. Overall, the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives.If you're in the market for a modestly-priced portable set of headphones, the Koss PortaPros are highly recommended."
1278,0,"What a failure, I needed to cover a cord, but this thing never got flat even after being heated. After a couple of weeks it keeps curling up and becomes more of a hazard than just the wires."
1279,2,"I was buying this as a button to help me to start/stop video recording. It doesn't work for that, it helps on the focusing (60d over here) when pressed halfway, but all the way down it takes a picture and it doesn't record. As no one posted something about video recording I suppose that I would give it a shot, but no It doesn't work for that if anyone was planning using it for that purpose."
1280,2,"the sound is great, the fit is great, but the cushions are wearing off after while...well guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and tear"
1281,0,"It is a cable for transferring digital signal... in the digital world, the smallest bit of information is either 0 or 1.  In terms of electricity, it is like, either 0 volt or 5 volt. So unless the cable is so lousy that the device cannot tell 0 volt from 5 volt, in which case a gold or platinum plated digital cable is not going to do any good. It either works or doesn't work. There is no &quot;in between&quot;.This is similar to DTV or HDTV -- either you get the picture or you don't. If you do, it is going to be prestine. If you don't, then there is no picture at all. Note that in this case, the analog (non-digital) portion of equipment still makes a difference, such as the antenna or the speaker cable that is non-digital.So an extremely expensive DVI cable shouldn't make any difference than an inexpensive one."
1282,2,"I got this mouse primarily because I was getting tendonitis in my mouse hand.  By the end of the day I had to spend 1 minute flexing and massaging my hand for every 2 minutes of mouse work.  This has resolved that problem.  I don't get any of the stiffness and soreness I get from a regular mouse.  However, I have had to sacrifice precision.  When you need to be precise and quick with the mouse pointer this mouse can be somewhat clumsy to work with.  For this reason I have to keep my regular mouse hooked up as well, but it's a small concession to make for the overall benefit of this mouse.  Also, I've noticed that the ball is starting to stick so it's essential that you keep it very clean. I imagine alcohol wipes will work fine for this."
1283,0,"These were recommended as &#34;frequently purchased with&#34; the Plantronics Headset I purchased. I did not order at the time, but when the very flimsy ear covers (on an otherwise great portable USB headset) fell off and were lost in the first month of ownership, I ordered them. Even though they said they fit my model, I still checked the measurements. All Good ... until they arrived. Way too small. Frustrating."
1284,2,"The Koss VC20 volume control works very well. At very low volume ((I would say less than 5% of max.) it gives sound only in the left canal, but that's really not a problem. I didn't notice any sound distortion otherwise.It has a small metal clip which can be &#34;removed&#34; (i.e. torn off) for the users who might find it problematic."
1285,2,"What I like about it (I own ebm-901):1. Open platform (thus lots of useful FREE software available).2. Generic AAA batteries support.3. Simple USB interface.4. Large screen.5. Good handwriting recognition.6. Sturdy and reliable case.7. Low power consumption.8. Good music playback quality.Now, about its well-known problems: folks, BACKUP your data on your MMC! This way you will NEVER lose your OS and apps! Come on! The device does have a power backup in the form of a capacitor, which is really bad and it hardly does anything. For a techie, it is not hard to put in a differect capacitor. Problem solved. Sometimes it helps keep memory intact if you pull out one dead battery and put it a fresh one, then pull out another one and replace it with fresh.You cannot manage your files on MMC from within the EBM's OS. Who knows if Ectaco will ever release a new version of the OS.Otherwise I love my eBookMan, I use it all the time, it's my primary mobile library, and I am quite hesitant to look elsewere for a new PDA."
1286,1,"I don't quite like the cheesy look of the headphone (Silver color like a toy). But I have to agree I do like the sound of it. The highs are crisp, the mids are warm, I don't care too much about the bass. This headphone is good for classic and vocals, but apparently not for trench and heavy metals. The sound is open and tansparent, and relatively smooth.Because I have a massive head, this headphone hurts my ears like hell. It is too tight for me. Pulling both side down to the end helps a little but it is still somewhat uncomfortable for me. So be aware, if you have a big head like I do, think before you make the purchase.I don't like the all-plastic feel of the headphone, and I think I already saw small cracks on the inner side of both part (left and right) of the bands (When I received this from Amazon it's like this already). I don't know how long this one is going to last, but I am afraid it might not be very long.Usually I place comfortablity after sound. But not this time. I do like the sound coming out of this headphone. But it is just too tight for me and I am not fond of the build quality of the headphone. (I do like the build quality of all the other sennheisers I own though)"
1287,0,"I bought this along with a new Olympus camera, for all the obvious reasons (faster downloading).  I'm not that enamoured with it.The good:- downloading is definitely faster than from the camera- it's portable, so I can use it on any of my PC's or laptops- I didn't have too many issues making it workThe bad- bad driver; still not XP certified.  I'd expect Olympus to have their act together in this regard- wouldn't work with my 7-in-1 floppy drive card reader; I've had to disable that on my PC to get this to work- doesn't like 'moving' pictures - will only 'copy' and then I have to manually delete the pictures through file manager or the camera- I think it is slow: plugged into a USB 2.0 and transfer rates are well below par.  It takes about 15-20 seconds to download a single SHQ.JPG picture (about 3.5MB)I personally would opt for something else (e.g. a multi reader with XP certified drivers) before getting this card reader.Happy shoppingJB"
1288,0,"If you're just surfing it's great, if you plan to online game with your PC this does not, and cannot be made to work.  You will get booted and it shut down the whole network within seconds.  After which you will be required to do a complete re-install and set up.  I wasted many hours on the phone with tech support trying to figure this out.However this is my fault & not the Linksys product.  I should have done the research before purchasing.  I guess that is why they make gaming routers!"

1292,0,We have used Logitech cordless desktops for years and I tried a Microsoft combo because of a great deal. I have now tried two Micro$oft cordless keyboard/mouse systems and can attest: Buy a Logitech.The feel and construction of the hardware is [inexpensive]. Keys are loose and floppy. The mouse feels like Soviet plastic.The software is lame too. Stupidly simple things like battery condition are not available under mouse or keyborad properties. The last straw was using a simple combination of keyboard and mouse click (like shift + click) was not possible in Windows Explorer. Maddening!And don't look for support online. Microsoft is typically a frustrating experience to find support. It's actually worse!
1293,1,"Perhaps it should be made of rated oxygen free copper, because with time humidity will generate sulphate on the wire affecting the conductivity and hence the quality of sound. However, I bought it for testing speakers and other component performance and will now replace it by a PVC encased and oxygen free copper cable. I guess if you live in a low humidity place it will serve its purpose for long while."
1294,0,I had great expectations when I bought this headphones. This some how cuts off 50% of the noise. The worst part of it is that it adds a HISS to when Noise Cancelling is switched on.
1295,1,"I guess I don't know what to expect anymore.  I mean, it's wire, UL listed, made in China (so I will NOT let my dog near it), and will work just fine.  I just wish RCA had not attached their name to it since it stands for &#34;Radio Corporation of America&#34;.  Have some corporate pride, for gosh sakes!"
1296,1,"One problem with surge protectors is they are like fuses,  if you test it for its total protection, it self destructs.  So the only way to know it will work is to examine the construction, test non-destructive parts, and then hope the rest work as advertised.  I disassemble units and examine them before I even plug them in.ProsErgonomics of the plug layout is very convenientaudible alarmprotection ratingConsOn disassembly, the unit had a lot of excess flux, it was so thick in some parts its like vaseline.  There were a few strands of hair inside.  Its banks of protection diodes were soldered with unacceptably long leads, 2 of them were shorted.  It didn't affect the protection since the polarity was correct, but it shorted two data lines together, sure enough the network jack did not work until I separated these diode leads.The MOV grouped together were coupled to their thermal fuses with a form of tape.  Unfortunately, One of them had unraveled so they were not coupled at all, this means had a surge happened the fuses were less likely to blow or would be delayed.  Most makers use shrink wrap tubing to hold them together.  Better designs encase the MOV in a small chambers inside the chassis to further contain debris and focus the heat on the fuse, but not this unit.After cleaning the interiors, there were no problem with the sockets: power, LED annunciators, phone, fast ethernet and cable.I'm not sure what the story was with this unit, but I returned it.  If it was a fluke from poor quality control, then on my examination of the other components, this SPD could work.  However, they MOV coupling is not optimal, the unit will get fairly hot before the fuse blows and likely melt the chassis before tripping the fuse.  Sure enough, some user posted an image of a unit with a melted deformed chassis.  Maybe Tripp Lite has improved this design since I bought mine, so given a benefit of doubt I rate it 3 stars."
1297,1,"It is a good product and the total size is good for a room measuring around 15'x15'.It is NOT totally copper, its copper clad aluminum to make costs lower. Wouldn't recommend it for a Hi-Fi system since it lowers the quality levels.The fact that it's 14-gauge means the sound will be clearer due to the low oxygen levels, something is great but once again, the fact it uses aluminum makes everything a trash for what you're paying for.Does just fine for any HT installation up to 50', longer than this the cable will loose quality because it's lower than 16 Gauge.Monoprice has true copper cables that'd work better on a Hi-Fi system, these are just okay."
1298,2,"As noted by others, these cable covers are easy to cut, mount and use. They are very easy to open (used a flat head screwdriver) and easy to put your cable and power cord into. If not stuffed with more than two cords, they are easy to close too.Also as noted, the adhesive is strong... so have your channel in the right place before removing the protective film or else you risk it getting stuck in some undesirable position and making a mess if you try to move it. The film was easy to pull off with the channel sitting right in the place we wanted to install it, so it should not be an issue if you do good prep work.The channels really look great in place! My only wishes would be: (1) Wish the channels were roomier as they max it one power cord and one cable or they won't close properly; (2) Wish that the T-junctions and corner elbow covers could be made a bit oversized... I had to use a cable-splitter at a T junction, and had to run an small two-prong extension cord to an elbow, and both remain uncovered as the respective covers are just too small.All considered, good product that I would recommend."
1299,0,Item did not state it was not 10- 1000 as is current models in this pro line.  Of no use for purpose I needed.  There response was not  good so will just not use them or recommend them.
1300,0,"Might as well use the camera timer and run into a shot. Apparently the remote system on the 5100 is completely proprietary in that we get only so many seconds per use and if we don't use the remote the camera switches back to whatever setting it had before. In other words, if there's a way to set this camera on a pod and wait for the shot to happen (like an animal coming to a den or nest, etc.) it's not going to work with this remote system. Instructions for the remote use in the camera manual are also very poor."
1301,2,"This recorder is another good Pearlcorder by Olympus, but it drops some of the features I found really useful that were in the old L200. I use mine for note taking and general short (less than an hour) recording chores. On the old L200, you had an Index Marker to, but on that recorder the indexer stopped the tape motion when ever it hit an index mark. On the J500, it only gives you a loud sound and you must release the rewind/fast forward button to hear the recording. Also the fast forward speed is so slow that the index mark doesn't sound and so you lose fast forward index search. It only works in rewind. (This might be the result of changes made to the rewind/fast forward system. It's a sliding lever now not buttons as on the old L200.) It's not a bad little recorder, I think the changes made to the tape handling chassis have really reduced the overall value of this recorder. Another thing that one needs to remember is the J500 only has auto shut off in playback and recording mode only,and at end of tape, but NOT in rewind or fast forward as the old L200 use to. So if you place it in rewind or fast forward and something comes up in which you forget it's running, it will get to the end of the tape and doesn't turn off. (Not normally a bad problem, but just one more thing you lose from the L200.) I think dropping the more useful features, and changing the tape handling chassis reduced the overall value of this recorder, especially since Olympus stopped making the L200. For that reason, it gets 4 stars instead of five."
1302,1,"While SimpleTech's 256 MB CompactFlash memory card is quite affordable, many users may find it too slow for practical use in today's more memory-intensive digital cameras.If you intend to use it for digital music or cameras of 2 megapixels or so in resolution, great--the card will work just fine.  Its 8MB burst and sustained 1.5MB write speeds even work okay in larger resolution cameras for low shooting rates; however, the real bottleneck I found in both my cameras and my laptop was its read time--which could take over a couple of seconds per shot when reviewing pictures!When compared to speed demons like SanDisk's Ultra II cards--or even my backup Vikings--the SimpleTech simply didn't read back quickly enough for my liking.  Still, it's on the low end price-wise for 256 MB cards, and for many people the card will work just fine."
1303,2,"I bought these babies at a FYE when I was just shopping around. I have read that they have amazing sound and you can't find a better sound for the money. Man were the reviewers right! The sound-stage is amazing, with great highs and bass. The bass is delivered so well, I can't find words other than impressive and intense, especially for the size of these headphones. I must say, they get better sound than headphones that range up to $120 and even more easily. I listen to a lot of 60's to 80's rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully. A 3D type of Sound. Also try the Koss KSC-75's for an even better performance.Pro's1) Price is unbeatable2) Great balance of high's, mid's and low's3) Ground breaking bass4) Great Sound-stage (Separation of instruments)5) A 3D sound6) Cool 80's design7) Sound doesn't need to be amplified (It shouldn't be either)Con's1) Gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while (1 hour or so)2) Seems flimsy at times3) Although it seems to be made of good material, the case/bag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out of."

1305,1,"I spent a full day researching which tv capture card I was going to get and decided on the all in wonder radeon 7500.  I'm glad I did.The installation was smooth.  Although it took a while to figure out how to set up to get audio.  I have 4 surround sound speakers and an amplifier.  When viewing TV, I finally did get sound, but it wasn't capturing the audio when I recorded.  Just remember that the to plug the adapter into the ""line out"" connection to the sound card.  Make sure that the ""installation wizard"" reflects that it is capturing to ""line out"" also.This card comes with everything.  All the cables for S-video, composite video, and audio cables.  But the best thing it comes with is the radio frequency remote control.  This baby does everything your universal remote can do.  And since it's radio frequency and not infra red, you can virtually use it anywhere in your house.The package includes an interactive TV guide that you can program to when and what you want to record, crossword puzzles, and Video Studio 6 (which I have not used yet).I have read other reviews on this product and most people will have difficulty with the installation.  When I installed the card, I went to ATI.com to update the drivers.  When I did, everything went to hell, so I did a system restore to get me back before I installed.  I'll keep the drivers that came with the disk, thank you.This All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 just blows my mind!!  I think its about the best $130 I ever spent.  I recommend the All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500 because it gives so much for so little.UPDATE:  1/16/04  Must reinstall every few months.  Software is buggy."
1306,0,"Background information first: I'm a health care provider, so I use the tungsten for inputting and modifying appointments several times per hour, 40+ hours a week. For me, the ease of inputting and accessing the address book, date book, and to-do's is the make it or break it factor. I upgraded from the Palm IIIC because even though it always served me without any problems, it was getting slow in searching for patients' names after 3 years of appointments built up in my datebook.Good news second: The display is pretty and easily readable; the form factor is nice and small so I can just keep it in my pants pocket; it plays mp3's very nicely with a free download of the RealPlayer; the voice recorder activates at the press of a hardware button and comes in handy while driving; this PDA can sort through 3+ years of my appointments in no time flat.Bad news third: Under serious usage, the digitizer becomes erratic and terribly frustrating. Where you place the stylus can be off by as much as several characters, first one way, then another, then back again, with no predictability. Unfortunately, you usually spot the error after writing in the wrong area, or worse, pasting instead of copying. It requires almost continual recalibration. It's clearly a hardware problem since tapping it on the side causes it to happen, but it's random and unpredictable. The result is a much slower inputting of data (and ample swearing).Perhaps worse is that the support I have gotten from Palm has been very, very frustrating. They have replaced the tungsten with another return a couple different times, and the exact same bug was present in each machine. While the tech people adamantly deny a hardware problem, one of their engineers was upfront with me. He acknowledged the hardware problem, but unfortunately couldn't do anything beyond sending me another or advising me to briskly smack it open and shut several times.Conclusion: If you don't demand too much of the digitizer, you'll probably be happy. If you get in any trouble and need tech support, you may be very unhappy with the company. Personally, since I like the Palm OS so much, I am about to purchase a Sony Clie."
1307,2,i have the rebel xsi.  purchased this remote to do family shots.  it works great.  i had an different after market remote that i lost and i'm glad i did.  range is respectable on this model.  do keep in mind that if using for tripod shots with slow shutter speed you need to be able to place the remote in front of the camera for it to work.
1308,1,"This wire worked in my simple, short run installation. Sound quality is probably not affected. However, I felt deceived when I discovered that this is not pure copper wire. It is copper clad aluminum. For the best quality, look for pure copper wire."
1309,2,"The product works as advertised, and is very simple to use. I am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a Spirit Box for use in investigations for my paranormal research group."
1310,0,"I own several USB 2.0/1.1 drives (including 3 of these) and this drive works 'ok' but it definitely isn't anything special:The actual functionality of the drive is fine, that is to say that you can transfer files to and from it, and it plugs into a USB port for transferring files to and from most computers that support USB--but that is what it's supposed to do.  The capacity of this unit is also now a bit dated; a mere 256MB, though was standard when I purchased mine.The drive's physical characteristics are where it has the most problems.  The design is, for lack of a better word, ""bad"".  As Flash drives go, this unit isn't very small at all, in fact it is rather wide.  Its abnormal shape can be intrusive when trying to use USB ports that are lined side-by-side, or in using USB ports that are next to the legacy keyboard and mouse ports on most motherboards.  Subsequently, I've had many problems with the drive just not *fitting* into a port because it wants to occupy the space of the adjacent ports.  The cap is also very poorly designed.  It consists of a very thin plastic cover with a clip that slips off easily, inevitably leaving you with either a broken cover, or none at all."
1311,0,"does not hold the plug tightly, requires a wrap in electrical tape to keep connected"
1312,0,Either I got a dud or the product is poorly designed.  I couldn't get ports 4 and 7 to work properly for USB Mass Storage devices.  Ended up returning this and adding PCI-USB interfaces to my desktop instead.
1313,1,"I purchased this with my Kodak DX3215 camera (which I love) because the tech support staff at Amazon assured me that it would work with multi-media card too. It does not.So the good people at Amazon Customer Support (I love them) promptly sent me a return ticket for it. Pity, though. I had called tech support just so that Amazon could be spared the expense of just such an event.And guess what? It turns out that I don't even need a media reader at all, because that's what the DX3215's docking station does beautifully for me anyway.However, I do agree that you should buy this if your digital camera lacks its own docking base, because its a great time saver."
1314,2,"With this piece combined with a 2x Barlow I can get great magnification without using high-power eyepieces. Only problem I found is the thread does not fit with the Celestron filters. I clarify, I can couple the filters with my Celestron 1.25 eyepieces but I cannot screw it directly in the Meade Barlow. I can do it with the Celstron Barlow. Not a big deal because, anyway, I use the Celestron Barlow along with the Meade Barlow. I wonder why the manufactures does not establish a standard for the threads."
1315,0,"I own the KX-TCA92 with volume control & like it. The ear piece broke away from the headest, so I bought this KX-TCA60 since the reviews were good & I have volume control on my phone. It is not a good head set. People on the other end kept saying to talk louder & that my voice sounded muffled. Even removing the mic cover and talking diectly into the holes didn't help. Swapping out the TCA92 during the same phone call without adjusting anything else improved sound quality & volume."
1316,0,But don't expect much more.  The earpads are hard to adjust to your ears.  One or the other keeps slipping forward or backward or downward.  The headband is very comfortable.  The sound is just okay.  And who thought that the huge volume controller was such a good idea?  Really?  The controller is jumbo-sized....  just like something out of the 1970's.
1317,1,"It produces a large amount of bass, which for some is a great thing.  However, for me, I wasn't looking for a big bassy sound.  I want to just round out the sound with some extra bass.  This thing gets real boomy and kinda bellows.  I have this thing turned way down so it doesn't over power the music.  If you want a lot of bass, then this is for you.  However, if you are a musician, like myself, and just want a well balanced full sound from top to bottom, this system might be a bit too much.  Can't beat it for the price though."
1318,1,This is my first wireless mouse and I've used it for 40-50 hours/week for over a month.  It works OK.  The pointer is at times a little jumpy and at other times not very responsive.  However for me in my situation it's worth dealing with that in order to be wire free.  I have used it for more than a month without having to change the batteries.
1319,2,"Have used these headphones for the past 6 months mostly for travel, including on airplane, with an mp3 player and also at home with my computer.  They are the best headphones I've tried, particularly at this price level, for sound quality.  On an airplane, they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones I've used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound I've encountered with noise cancelling headphones.  Because of the low distortion, I've been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise.  Also, there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level, the passengers next to you won't be bothered as much by loud music.  The headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use.  At home, the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself.  I highly recommend these headphones.  If asked about the negatives, I would say there are 3 things:  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal - the design of these are old and this could be improved; the cord is shorter than one would like; and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones, which deteriorate over time (but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on Amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace.  Look around on the net for reviews and you will find these are very positively reviewed."
1320,0,I had no idea that the issues we are having with our CC Radio were so epidemic. LCD display is intermittant and the preset buttons are flaky. And after reading all these reviews I've no intention of sending it for a rebuilt radio...just to have the same issues return at a later date. How many years have these problems been known about this flawed design? It's simply planned obsolescence. They won't see another dime from us.
1321,1,"I didn't have extremely high expectations for these headphones.  Basically I wanted something to use at work for long periods of time.  My current ones are old sony's and need some re-soldering, so I figured I'd pick up two pairs of these - the price is right.I have an average sized head and these things squeeze my head very tightly.  In addition, the ear pads are too small to go around your ear, so your ear lobe and the top of your ear are get sandwiched between the headphones and your melon.  Definitely not for use for long periods of time -- fine for the first 15 minutes (kind of... still uncomfortable)."
1322,1,"It's good, but not great for my usage.  I own a bakery and wanted something to beep in the kitchen when a customer walks in.  The beep is so annoyingly loud that it mobilizes everyone.  I would like a way to shorten or lower it.The batteries died after 2 months..but then again it's triggereing much more often than if it were used for a driveway.The sensor is very good...no false alarms, or people's shadows triggering it."

1324,0,"when I received the package, the box from the cord concealer looked as if It had been open. I don't like how it is rolled up because it makes it very difficult to get it to stay flat while you tape it. Also you don't get enough tape. I only used 3 ft of the cord concealer and I didn't have enough tape to cover both sides of the concealer so I had to leave gaps in between to cover the ends and the middle of both sides. after a couple of days the tape slowly starts to come off due to the cord concealer wanting to roll back up."
1325,0,Couldn't get my computer to recognize the digital camera so had to send it back. Could not get any help to try and resolve the problem.
1326,0,"I've tried several notebook webcams and was excited to get the logitech Quickcam Pro because of the good reviews, but I must say I'm very disappointed with the webcam and will be returning it for the Creative Ultra Webcam for Notebooks.The main problem is the design to attach it to your notebook screen. The hinge is so weak that the webcam just flops over and is always pointed at the ceiling or above your head. On the box they show the webcam securely fitted to the screen and it never sat that securely on my HP DV1000 or Dell D600 screens.On the plus side, I liked the image quality and the built-in microphone. But, those highlights are negated by the fact that its very difficult (if not impossible) to even get the camera pointed in the right direction!My suggestion is to try to find a notebook webcam that fits securely on to your screen (e.g. Creative Ultra)."
1327,0,What a waste of money.  The clam shells would not stay close.  I ended up tossing the entire lot of them and went back to the old school jewel cases.  :-(
1328,1,I have not used this much just to see if problems r my wi fi or enternet it works good for that
1329,0,"The cables are too thick, bulky and stiff. I would have loved it if they were slimmer, both for visuals and utility.As it is, I can barely make the split outlet ends face the direction I want."
1330,1,It fits perfectly on my bose speakers as promised although its a tad short as compared to the pictures. And it wiggles slightly when on top of the carpet as compared to standing on hardwood floors.
1331,2,"I bought this w/o checking to see if I had an preamp jack...I assumed I did.  Clearly by now you know I did not, so I goofed.  However, if you want to power an outdoor system or secondary system at home this will do the trick.  Let me caution you though make sure you read the specs.  I made another boo boo by reading too quickly, I thought it was 100 watts per channel...uh no 100 watts total, i.e. 50 per channel.  I kinda blew it on this one and can only blame myself.  If you don't need much power and only want to power smaller speakers grab this now.  If you have larger speakers go for the next model up with a bit more power.  All in all for the price it does the trick."
1332,2,"I needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever I go. These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag."
1333,2,"This is an excellent product for the money.  First time I tried them on it was unbelieveable how well they sounded.  Even the low end is pretty good for such a lightweight headphone.Previously I had a set of Altec Lansing UHP304 Headphones which I paid well over $80.  They sounded very good, but after less than a year of use a short developed in the cable and one side kept cutting out.  I returned to Altec Lansing and never heard anything from them.  No more Altec Lansing.  These Koss headphones at less than half the price and equal sound quality, and with a lifetime limited warranty can not be beat.  Had them for over a year and still sound great.  The sensitivity is also excellent which means I do not have to turn up the volume as much as with some of the cheaper headphones.A quick note about Koss, I had a set of Pro 4AAA (I think) headphones that I bought in the early 1980's.  I started having problems with them.  I wrote a letter to Koss and sent it with the headphones to them and in a few weeks I had my headphones back repaired and working perfectly.  And this was around 2003.  Still have the headphones, even bought an upgrade version of them.Good company, good product."
1334,1,"The splitter is completely flat, meaning you have to screw on your COAX cables before screwing the splitter into a wall or beam using the screw eyelets.  The same goes for removing a COAX cable, you have to unscrew the splitter from the wall before unscrewing the coax cable.  For most people this is ok, but for me, I needed something raised when installed, and so I ended up picking up what I needed from the local Hardware Store.  It costed a little more, but it also doesn't have the same cheap feeling as this one, so I'm happy."
1335,1,"I bought these headphones for my brother and after trying them out I went ahead and forced the headphones to cause less pressure on my head because they are very tight. I don't consider my head to be big and my brother's definitely isn't, yet both he and I have experienced discomfort from these headphones.That said, they have better sound than more expensive headphones that I have, even it's bigger brother from Sennheiser.  Stronger base yet clear treble, these headphones sound great.  Just don't expect comfort and you won't be disappointed."
1336,2,"At first my son wasn't sure about the retro look of these head phones.  Now that he saw them in person, he wears them everyday.  First pair came and the right didn't work.  Amazon quickly exchanged it.  Great deal"
1337,2,"I kid you not. Decided to splurge (over $300) on a super set of earphones for my ipod from Shure and hated them and sent them back. Then I tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound, aesthetics and discrete form. I simply love them. As a frequent traveller, I appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane. Highly recommend them."
1338,2,"I have recently realized that I am what some like to refer as an ""audiophile.""  I've always loved good sound reproduction, excellent sound range as well as quality.  When I was younger, I used to buy Koss pretty much exclusively.  Lately though, I've been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions, the Koss PortaPro being at the top of the list!These headphones have been around since I was a teenager and unlike me, they are still going strong!  They have fantastic sound, they are not overly affected in the bass range (they don't add extra bass for the ""boom boom"" window rattlers out there), they are economical, comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy.  Also, they are recommended by SERIOUS audiophiles as the best portable out there.I can't agree with that entirely; I also recommend the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 depending on your needs.  But of the three, these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans (headphones, I guess I'm learning the audiophile lingo!).The Koss PortaPro have the Comfort Zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head.  I have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare.  I like the firmest setting on the Comfort Zone but I've tried the other two settings as well and I can honestly say that there is a difference; it is NOT just a gimmick.  The Comfort Zone really works.These are truly portable also!  They fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that Koss provides.  I personally would recommend buying a semi-hard shell case that Koss also sells just for the extra protection.What more can I say?  If you'd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range, the Sennheiser PX-100 and PX-200 are rugged, comfortable and highly portable.  (They collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case.)  If you like earbuds, the Sennheiser MX-500 is wonderful with its in-line volume control; the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small.  And finally, the Koss KTXPRO1 is an excellent portable headphone with an in-line volume control.  It uses a Titanium element to drive it.  All of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the Koss PortaPro and I really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are.  I believe you will be too.Though I've become somewhat disillusioned by Koss as I've become a so-called ""audiophile"" (why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else?), I highly recommend these cans to you.  If you are on a budget, you especially can't go wrong.  Remember that Koss guarantees all their cans for life with their ""no questions asked"" guarantee.  It's worth it!  So as my review title states, ""The Koss PortaPro shines in every area.""Oh, one last thing:  Don't listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky; they aren't.  The design is what gives the PortaPro its unique sound quality and I personally think they look cool!  Ultimately though, it is the sound that matters, right?  :)"
1339,2,"Pros:  It is an inexpensive solution to control camera in a distance. It's more convenience to make self shot than to use camera's 10 second time release. Since it is so small, I carry with camera all the time.  I have used it for four years, it still works as a new one.Cons: Working distance is very limit, in normal condition, you could get about 15 ft working range. Under strong sunlight, you may not be able to control camera above 5 ft. You have to point it accurately toward camera sensor, and you have to be in the position that camera sensor can see you. Other wise, it does not work.  Therefore, it will not work if your are on the left side or behind camera, since sensors are on the front and on the right side of the camera (Canon Rebel).  Serious user should use radio frequency based remote control instead of this one."
1340,2,"I like using this remote with my Canon XTi, but I always have to remember to switch the camera to timer mode and the lense to manual focus. I still think it is more convenient to use the wired remote because I have a preference to be behind the camera instead of dangling the wireless remote in front of or over the camera. However, the wireless remote is convenient because it is wireless and it is faster to access for those quick shots if you are constantly on the move without spending the additional time to unwrap the wired remote. I especially enjoy using the wireless remote for group shots with myself included instead of the camera's automated timer. Overall, I use both the Canon wireless RC-1 and the Canon wired 60E3 remotes. For some it might not be necessary to have both, but I like having the option to use either. It just depends on what the specific situation calls for."
1341,0,"The 3 ft version of this cable is sold by the company ""cmple"" it is not the same cable listed in the description.  Cable quit charging my iphone after only 3 uses. Make sure that you get the cable sold by Amazon"
1342,2,"I bought the lens to match my Meade telescope, so am not able to compare it to other brands. I thought it was a quality lens for a reasonable price."
1343,0,"I had a Recoton DSC-IR100A, and it didn't work but maybe 1% of the time, so I thought I'd buy this one. Unfortunately, it only worked 10% of the time about 20ft away, passing through 1 wall. Setup was easy, but it would take numerous keypresses of the remote for anything to pick up.  For example, even SLOWLY pressing channel 7221 on the remote, it might pick up 221, 21, 721 or nothing at all.  I've tried moving both the transmitter and receiver to different locations, but that didn't help, only sometimes it would just completely not work at all.  I doubt it's my satellite receiver or remote being incompatible, because the picture of the remote on the box is exactly the same as the Dishnetwork remote I'm using. Perhaps it is something with my house... all my PC's have wireless keyboards and mice, maybe they're on the same frequency? I have both 900MHz and 2.4GHz cordless phones, and an 802.11g wireless network. Not to mention I live near a cellular tower. Perhaps all this stray RF is confusing it since I've tried 2 different remote extenders and neither works. At any rate, I'm very disappointed, and this is going back."
1344,1,"Took some getting use to, because I'm accustomed to a brighter, more detailed sound. But the warmth and creaminess makes for a pleasant listening experience. Older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out. Not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount. Good upgrade for those coming out of cheap headsets."
1345,0,"these are ok for wrap arounds.  They hurt my ears though, the bud could be a little smaller.  I like the way they are angled in, that is nice.  But if I wear them to  long my ears start to hurt."
1346,1,this little gadget will be perfect if it can also be powered by batteries or auto charger so that it can be portable and use with car screens on the road.
1347,2,"I am truly an amateur astronomer.  My childhood was peppered with dime-store telescopes that showed me a new blurry world.  When I got the EXT-90EC I expected little more than a brighter blur.  To my surprise and  delight I was wrong.  Out of the box, in bad lighting conditions,  surrounded by trees, I saw some of the most breath-taking images of the  moon.  In fact, I spent the next six hours observing the moon.  I saw  craters in detail.  I even saw some craters within craters.  I did venture  to a bright star I saw in the sky.  It turned out to be Jupiter.  It was a  highly recognizable Jupiter.  Not another dot in the sky.  I could see  three of Jupiter's moons in orbit.  I couldn't even make out Jupiter's  moons with the naked eye.I tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised!  The local  river area came alive with wildlife.  The photographic possibilities are  endless!I purchased the #883 Deluxe field tripod, #932 45 Degree  Erecting Prism, #497 Autostar controller, and the #774 hard case with the  telescope.  I highly recommend you do the same.  They all add to the total  experience.  The tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial  viewing.  The 45 Degree Erecting Prism is needed for terrestrial viewing.  If you don't use it, your images will be inverted.  The autostar, once  aligned, will position the telescope to any viewable object, and then  continue to track it.  The case is a convenience and insurance policy."
1348,0,"I attached it to a microphone, and the cable worked well for a while. After 4 months, it just died. Shame really..."
1349,1,"I own both these and a set of Logitech Z-2300s, and I strongly prefer the Zs. The sound to my ears, is just more full with much clearer, crisper bass response on the Logitech speakers. They also have better dynamic range than the Klipschs.The first set of Klipschs I bought were defective (thank you Amazon for making the exchange so simple!!). I don't find the build quality quite up to that of the Logitechs.The one advantage that the Klipsch speakers have for me is that they have an auxiliary input into which one can plug an ipod or other audio device. This is why I bought them, and that is a great feature that works beautifully. I don't understand why Logitech didn't put such a simple feature on their top-of-the-line speakers.So, I would say, if you need the option of using these speakers with an mp3 player, go with Klipsch. If not, go with Logitech."
1350,2,"This is a very good radio. When you factor in the price and the size, it's really great. The price does seem to fluctuate some, but most of the time it is only $10 more than the 510 but offers a public address function and more importantly adjustable receive (RF) gain. This is very important in my opinion. AM communication is very badly hampered by electrical noise. CB's can be very bad about picking up lots of noise from the vehicle, especially now with more electronics going into vehicles every year. Luckily this radio has a very good automatic noise limiter (ANL) which is very effective in reducing overall noise. Combine that with the ability to reduce the sensitivity of the radio by turning down the gain, and you can reduce the noise very much when you don't mind the sacrifice in picking up weak signals. When you are trying to pick that signal up out of the noise, you can then turn the gain up. You will increase the noise, but also amplify that signal, possibly making it readable.One thing to be aware of is that the hand mic for this radio is very small. Smaller than your standard CB size microphone. Swapping this out isn't necessarily the easiest affair either if you don't select a power (amplified) microphone. A standard non powered microphone such as an Astatic 636L will not work with this radio, you will have terribly low audio. Your best bet is to stick with stock or use a power mic like the Astatic Road Devil or D104 which will get the audio up loud enough for the radio. A replacement mic from a 505xl will also work well and is a large size, but still has the look of a cheap stock microphone which many people don't like.In summary, this radio packs a lot of performance into a small package that many other radios just can't match. Modern vehicles just do not have the space that the older vehicles do and the small form factor of this radio makes for an easy install. If you like the chromed out big radio look, this might not be for you. If you want a simple, small, clean looking, durable radio, with a good feature set then this would be a good fit for you."

On one pair I had even soldered on my own replacement plug, and I called Koss to make sure they would still be covered.  The man on the phone said, ""You could chop them up into a million pieces and mail the pieces to us in a bag, and we'd still send you a replacement set.""  Now that's customer service!Sound Quality:  You will not find anything in this price range that even comes close.  The bass is deeper than you would expect for such a small device, and the highs are clear.  The sound is not fatiguing at all.  I listen to them at the office every day for up to 8 hours and they are brilliant.Comfort:  Since they are open-ear design, they don't make your head sweat.  The metal band can snag your hair occasionally but it's not a major problem.Looks: 80's tastic.  I think that's a plus, your mileage may vary.Value for money: unbeatable."
1352,2,Works great. Good buy. Found it with you at a great price. I would recommend it to others who have the need.
1353,2,The product works as advertized.  The adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely.  The wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage.  The cord is perhaps thinner than I would have expected but should be ok.  The body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough.  If the product proves to be durable I will change my rating to a 5....  I recently updated the review to a 5 star rating.  I have had no issues with this adapter.
1354,0,"I was very disappointed that an isolation transformer failed to resovle the 60 hz hum nose emanating from my electric guitar amplifier.  Perhaps this particular model simply is not robust enough.  I returned it for a full refund, but had to pay return shipping (this is a heavy device that is expensive to ship).If any musicians have suggestions then please leave a comment.  Thank you."
1355,0,"I HAD THIS RADIO FOR SIX MONTHS WHEN THE BUTTON FOR PRESETS BROKE. IT WOULD NOT WORK. SO I CALLED SANGEAN, VERY DISAPPOINTED. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK WITH $17 FOR REPAIRS. THE CASE NEEDED SOLDERING. STICK WITH SONY. THIS RADIO IS NOT WORTH TEN DOLLARS. 90 DAY WARRANTY JUST ENOUGH FOR THEM TO RIP U OFF!!!!!THIS IS THE SECOND SANGEAN I HAD TROUBLE WITH AND WILL BE THE LAST!!!!!"
1356,1,"The Clie 415T would have rated 5 stars if not for its extremely dim screen.I bought the 415T and used it for 3 weeks before returning it and buying a Clie 610C.  (I highly recommend the 610C.)  While I absolutely loved the 415T's thin, brushed aluminum chassis, I just couldn't get used to how dim the screen is.  If there is any kind of bright light behind you the screen is almost impossible to read.  You need to have the back light on almost all the time, and even that was unsatisfactory.  The blue-green back light is too weak to remedy the situation.Another disappointment is the &quot;Screen Commander,&quot; Sony's program that turns the Clie into a remote control unit for your TV and SOME other components.  Not that I bought the Clie for this feature, but it would have been cool if it had worked well.  The problem is that the 415T will only control 4 components at a time:  your TV, DVD, VCR and receiver.  It will NOT control your cable box or a CD changer, so for me the feature turned out to be worthless.Bottom line, though is that the screen is just too dim.  If Sony fixes the screen brightness they will have a real winner on their hands, because the 415T has by far the coolest form factor of any PDA."
1357,2,"I had a change jar where I collect all my change. By the time I dumped it I had $95. I went to a coinstar and, to avoid the coinstar tax, got an Amazon receipt. With the money I got this flash. It is very affordable (obviously) and there is a reason. The majority of the adjustments you need to use yourself. Call me inexperienced but I still can't figure out how the calculator on the side works. But nonetheless I get excellent results. The light fill is equivalent to any Canon Speedlite. The reason, again, for the Vivitar's relatively cheap price is because most of it's controls are manual, where the Speedlite is automatic. BUT, this can be a good thing. If you are looking to your first flash this is a good candidate. With it's lack of automatic control, the user can learn how the amounts of light can affect a photo. It is a good learning experience and I have learned a lot. (This being my first external flash)The build quality comes across as cheap. Possibly a 6 out of 10. It is made in Japan (Good quality camera equipment usually comes from there. If it's made in China STAY AWAY.) The foot is made of plastic so one drop will probably break it. So just be careful when handling it. It uses 4 AA batteries. It says not to use rechargeable but I do and it works fine with no ill effects. It comes with a slide-in diffuser. Lets just say I'm getting a better one for Christmas. I have also heard these make great satellite flash units because they are plentiful and cheap. The Vivitar 285HV is not damaging to the camera because there is no high voltage feedback.A bit of my background for credibility's sake. I own a Canon SX10IS and photography has been a hobby for around 9 months now. I realize I have a point and shoot and should have a DSLR. But I do not have a lot of money and wish to pursue photography more. So, for now, I use a high end point and shoot. I have submitted my photos to many places, including my university. Many of my photos have been published in news articles. (Probably just because I have my camera all the time so I get rare shots)Edit:It has been 4 years since I wrote this review. This particular unit still works! The plastic foot i worn out at this point though. The lock doesn't do anything. I am now a professional photographer and own three Vivitar 285HVs. They are still my light of choice as they are very easy to use. I use them in my portable studio with umbrellas. The 6000K bulb temperature makes it very easy to white balance. It is only 500K off from natural sunlight (5500K). The Vivitar 285HV has held up to the test of time. This only confirms that this flash is a great product.Since I last posted my camera, I have upgraded to a Canon 40D and 60D."
1358,0,Don't bother with this one.  I've had to input all my info twice after having it all erased.  The battery indicator showed I still had a third of my power left in my battery both times and after the battery power is gone it erased all the addresses and appointments I had input. The readability and resolution is good but what's the point if you can't access the data.  Don't get a pda that uses batteries!
1359,0,"I really urge everyone to stay far away from this product if you value your cassettes. The one I purchased mangled the first cassette I put in (an irreplaceable one - how could I have been so silly as to put it in without testing the player?). In any case, this product really is a piece of junk. But then, you get what you pay for.I do want to add that amazon came through for me."
1360,2,"In no means are these headphones studio quality. These are for the person on the go and no I don't mean running. The foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise. The base is okay, but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it. I did this on my IPhone 3GS and I was please with the results. Other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music taste."
1361,0,"I recently received the e335.  I am a palm user, but was seduced by a $... amazon rebate and a $... toshiba rebate.  At approximately $... net, how could you lose on this 64 mb thin machine?  Well, I lost.  On day three the machine started to freeze.  I rebooted once and had to reinstall everything.  And then, 30 minutes later, it happened again.When it worked, I loved it.  Unfortunately it was a VERY short love afair."
1362,2,"This little case cover does the job. The best feature is the clear plastic front that protects the LCD screen. The belt clip on the back is somewhat useful, but I've found that it clips better to a shoulder strap on a backpack better than on a belt loop."
1363,2,I purchased these to clean up the maze of cables associated with my computer and auxiliary gear. They work very well. I find that these are superior to the &#34;Ut Wire 5-Inch Flexi Ties Cable Wrap&#34; (which I also purchased on Amazon). I recommend these self-attaching ties.
1364,0,"If you are looking into buy this camera....DON'T. get the Sony HDR-A1U High-Def camera it's 20x times better,newer,same price and High-Def.if you buy the GL2 you will get the ""remove the cassette"" warning after about a year of use!!!!!"
1365,2,"I use this case for my Garmin Etrex 30, it' fits in the case okay, but it isn't exactly tight. It defiantly won't fall out but it would be nice to see Garmin improve the fitment for this product. All in all a great buy, gives my GPS more protection and allows me to clip it onto my bag."
1366,2,"In my apartment I found myself in a rather awkward situation where I had to run cables all over the place. Having found this cordmate kit did the job.Taking this off was difficult, but I soon found using a hair dryer makes it come off easier. When you want to pull this off a wall use a hair dryer to heat the cordmate before and as you are removing it. There were still some black spots that stuck but not many."
1367,2,"I bought the Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite to go along with myCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lensto be used on aCanon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR. I really haven't explored extreme macro photography before, so I thought I might as well see if it is something I could love. So as I do with most things I get interested in, I went a little nuts and bought a ton of equipment, including the Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite. Note, I am an amateur photo enthusiast, so my perspective is offered from the point-of-view of an  enthusiasts who just loves to go out there and capture as many nifty exposures as I can for fun, not necessarily a perspective for the pros.Observations: Even though the f-stop for the Canon 100mm Macro lens is a 2.8, you still need a ton of lighting to get good shots without cranking up the ISO or slowing down the shutter speed to something that will invariably lead to a blurry picture even when using a tripod. This Macro Ring Lite offers a fairly reliable solution to the problem. You could also invest in theCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM Macro Lenssince the L-series comes with image stabilization and is very well reviewed, but there are many situations where I could see needing the Macro Ring even with the L-Series w/ IS. That and the L-series lens is almost $900. But that upgrade will probably come in due time. Until then, I will continue to use the Canon 100mm f2.8 USM Macro lens, which is also very well rated.On to the Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring LitePros:Nicely built with a heavy feel to the unit, especially the cordAA batteries make it easy to powerCommunicates with the camera's E-TTLThe guide LEDs are a very helpful for quick focusTakes nice pics without too much washout like other flashes can causeVery useful for inanimate object closeupsHelpful with living subjects that aren't afraid of the flash's guide lights or noisesMakes your camera look kick-assCons:Adds quite a bit of overall weight when loaded with batteriesI would have liked it to also work with Canon batteriesIt is on the higher end of the price spectrumReally doesn't work well on human subjects (from my own experience, you make have different results)Not perfect when trying to get spontaneous shots since there is so much fiddling with the flash settingsGuide LEDs and noise seems to startle the more jittery of my small subjects like anoles & skinks, spiders and winged creaturesThe exposure color tends to be too white (5400K) and the lite doesn't come with filters for color offsetting (but I am a dirty cheater who loves PhotoShop and uses it shamelessly, I solve many of the filtering issues in post)But after using the flash for a week or so, it has its unquestionable benefits and works perfectly in most of the situations I have used it in. But there are a few drawbacks that hold the Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite form being a perfect addition to the macro photographers arsenal. I would still highly recommend the Canon MR-14EX Macro Ring Lite for the more serious enthusiast who won't mind spending a little time with it to learn its strengths and secrets."
1368,1,"As expected, it works fine.What is unusual is that it always triggers a warning that it could be run at a higher speed.Leads me to believe it's actually wired as a USB 1.1 device, not a USB 2."
1369,0,"I kept clicking on the free download option, but all I got was ads trying to get me to buy versions of Memorex software. I finally got tired of trying to get Memorex to make good on their offer whereupon I decided to cut my losses, trash their useless (to me) labels, and firmly resolve to avoid all Memorex products in the future."
1370,1,"I own a Canon 10x30 IS binocular, which I LOVE. My wife wanted a lighter binocular, so I ordered the 8x25 IS. I am dissappointed in the Image Stabilization in the 8x25. I get a more stable image in the 10x30 despite the greater magnification. The 8x25 stabilization leaves a noticable shake in the image and for about the first second of activation, the image drifts slowly as the system ""warms up""(?) I tried replacing the battery and even returned the first set, but the second binocs have the same behavior.  If I had never seen the larger binoculars, I would probably be satisfied (barely) with the 8x25, but after experiencing the immediate response and rock-steady image of the 10x30, the 8x25 stabilization was a definite let down. Otherwise the optics are great."
1371,2,"I always keep these around the house, as I always seem to find uses for them!If I need a longer tie, I can just attach these to each other.I use them for tying up cords, handing things and organizing my garage.I am nit sure how strong they are, but for the things I am using them for, they are just perfect.Good product."
1372,2,They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal. This fit is better than silicon earbuds. The sound quality I'd much better than any earbud in this price range.
1373,0,"The Sony instructions state that these work most effectively on lower frequencies.  I found that these do not really work that well in any frequency range.My first test involved sitting in the airport terminal with the headphones on, and turning on and off the noise canceling feature.  I could not distinguish any difference in background noise during this test.My second test involved turning on and off the noise cancelling feature while in flight.  I did notice that the sound of the engines was decreased slightly, but not enough to make me want to keep them.I later listened to another person's over the ear style noise canceling headphones, and they were significantly better at reducing the background noise of the plane.Thankfully, the place I purchased them from will let me return them."
1374,2,"I was looking for something to replace the headphones that came with my iPod since they're EXTREMELY uncomfortable but I do like the sound quality. I've been through about 3 different kinds. Some I've passed off due to comfort and some due to bad sound quality. These ear buds are like putting the small foamy ear plugs in your ears. I've always found them pretty comfortable and these headphones are the same. The sound quality is very different than the iPod ear buds and FULL OF BASS. They also certainly block out a lot of background noise. Like I said, they're like putting in the foamy earplugs. I highly recommend these headphones, especially like the price."
1375,0,"The remote was listed as used, like new, and it did look brand new. I liked that the vendor included an extra battery and that it arrived on time. However, I couldn't get the unit to work with either battery. I'm returning it and have gone to another retailer for a new unit."
1376,1,"Pros: Very comfortable for extended listening. Excellent to outstanding sound quality. Excellent operation, when in same area of transmitter. Spare battery, so a charged one is always ready. Excellent product support.Cons: Rating of 100 - 300 ft reception (one important consideration in purchase) may be possible; however, in my situation it isn't there. With the transmitter located in my den (lower level) clipping occurs in the upper rooms less than 35 - 50 ft away. Reception is problematic, also, outdoors - again, less than 50 feet from the transmitter. Reception depends largely on your homes construction, obstacles between the transmitter and headphones, other devices operating on the same frequency - so, wearing these boys while mowing the lawn just isn't going to be a pleasant experience.Construction is adequate, if the phones are handled somewhat carefully. The area where the ear pieces are attached and allow them to swivel is the weak link. This area is really small for the task and one broke from the simple act of putting them on and taking them off. That's why I can comment on the company's product support, they replaced them sans any charge.Price. Fairly high, especially if the range is a primary factor. In my case, only able to use these phones while in the same area as the transmitter, I probably could have made a cheaper choice and received comparable results."
1377,1,"This little cassette converter has fair sound, but it isn't great.  It seems to chop off the high treble and lowest bass. It has quiet operation and is easy to use."
1378,2,"We decided to purchase this after reading some of the reviews of the Memorex MP3 cd player.  I got exactly what I expected--a portable CD player that plays my mp3 tunes!  The ESP is fairly good.  Considering that an mp3 song takes up only 1/10 the space compared to a regular CD, if the lens moves in the slightest bit, the song is over!  I haven't tested the player with it sitting on my dash yet, though.It doesn't recognize ID3 tags, but it does have a pretty neat organization of the tunes.  Each folder on the CD is an &quot;album&quot; and then the songs in the folder are tracks on that album.  It plays the albums alphabetically by the 8+3 short DOS name, and likewise for each track.  So, here's a tip if you want to order them how you like.  As DOS naming is curious, add the track number to the BEGINNING of each mp3 filename, then the Expanium will definitely play the tunes in the necessary order.  I learned this after my first CD mix!Since the display simply shows only the album number and track, I recommend using a utility like mp3lister to generate a list of all the tracks.  I sort the list in Excel by folder then by filename.It's a very simple design and it plays all my mp3 songs, so I have been very pleased.  I can't stop making CDs now!"
1379,2,"Unless you can convince yourself that you need the features of higher models (such as the 430EX), this is a great flash.  It is very simple - turn it on, take the picture, turn it off.It seems to be a little less harsh than the popup flash on my Rebel XT.  it also claims to be a little more powerful than the popup flash.  Finally, I have lens hoods on a few of my lenses.  Thus, the popup flash often creates a ""shadow"".  This flash takes care of that problem.If you fall somewhere between being a clueless photographer who has no idea what this flash might do for you, but are short of an overeager hobbyist who might want to fiddle around with more advanced features, then this is a good flash.It does not swivel or tilt, but I don't care about that.  I mainly wanted a little more power than my popup/builtin flash and I wanted to get above my lens hoods to prevent shadowing.  This flash works for me.I give it 4 stars b/c there seems to be a notable reduction in light output if you take rapid fire shots."
1380,2,"I've had the bag for a little over 2 weeks now, and am enjoying it well...I can carry 2 Canon DSLRs quite comfortably with 4 lenses (16-35, 24-70, 24-105, and 70-200), and 1 flash (420)Only issue I have is the bag height - it is a little tight having the 24-70 mounted on a body, and loading it vertically.Overall, great price and sturdy build (bag stays firm fully loaded), and the non-slip shoulder pad keeps the bag secured when carrying...Would definitely recommend!"
1381,1,These headphones should meet your expectations for sound quality from a $25 pair of headphones - I am surprised Senheiser put their name on them because they are neither remarkable or an especially great value.High and mid range seem a bit flat but the bass is solid.I returned these because they are simply too tight for my head. If your hat size is 7-1/4 or larger you may want to try something else. They were painful to wear after just 10 minutes.
1382,2,"I recently bought an LG 55LN5700 Smart TV and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a Kensington Lock port.This is rather useful since in my country and my neighourhood, it provides me with the peace of mind I need if I go to work or on trips to know that my TV is held securely to my wall.The cable itself is made of good quality and if my 55 inch TV was left to be suspended by the cable, I'm sure it would easily handle the weight.If you have a smart TV with a Kensington Lock port, and you want an extra level of security, I recommend this lock!"
1383,2,"Pros:Most likely the best accessory I have for my 30D.  Well suited for low angle shooting of flowers etc.Cons:I've found no way to secure the finder to the camera.  I cannot trust it to stay on the camera while moving about in the out-of-doors.  Also a little more friction would be nice as the finder is rotated around, it tends to flop around far too much.Update:  For my Canon 5D mk11 the same applies."
1384,2,"Just a little research into how this works shows that this is a two-piece system.  First, something to attach to your particular model of telescope and then something to attach that piece to your particular brand of camera.  Such low ratings based upon not understanding this are unjustified.Update:  I've used this (along with the appropriate adapter) with my Canon 300D and a Meade ATX70 telescope.  While it's difficult to focus (sensitive controls), it produced excellent pictures.  For the amount of money the adapter costs, it opens up a lot of possibilities for photography."
1385,2,"My only gripe is that this remote is low-powered IR - it has to have a fairly clear line of sight to the camera's sensor - ie. remote triggering from behind the camera sometimes doesn't work - i've even had a very large lens block the signal.Other than that, it works as designed - no complaints.I like the two modes - instant and delayed triggering."
1386,2,"I purchased this for use with my old Canon Rebel XTI. It works great, and I love the shutter lock function for long exposures."
1387,0,"I watched Spiderm-man on a Bose set of speakers in 5.1. This consisted of the vsc-10 center, bose towers (i dont remember the model number, but its the one with the tweeter that point the wrong way and woofers in the backside), and these Bose 161 for surrounds.The sound coming from the center speaker and these speakers was so unbearable at high volumes, that me and my friend agreed it would be best to turn them off and just watch the movie in stereo. They both sounded very muddy and resonance comming off the plastic construction was quite annoyting. Theyre both cheap feeling in construction and i would not be surprised if they both used the same woofers inside (the center and these).When you are buying these speaker, you are basically buying from the bottom of the barrel of what Bose has to offer, which is really bad, considering how mediocre their more expensive offerings sound."
1388,1,"I've had about 4 or 5 sets of computer speakers. I love speakers. I am a audio enthusiast and spend a lot of time upgrading my computer, home, and car sound systems as a hobby. I REALLY wanted to like these speakers. My roommate has them and his have worked perfectly for the six or seven month duration he has had them for. Unfortunately, that is not the case with mine. I ordered these speakers roughly 3 months ago. Since that time, I have had not one, but two control pods with some significant problems. The first one that I had was immediately inoperable. If you touched the volume dial it would distort the sound, and make the volume randomly change to either full volume (if you have heard this speakers, that is LOUD!), or no volume. Once I got this replaced, the new control pod had a defective male plug (the one that goes into the back of your computer) and results in a loud buzzing unless the plug cable is pulled at the perfect angle. Additionally I also get random sound distortion for half a second at a time while I am listening to anything on these speakers.So far as good things go. My roommate has had these speakers for months and had no problems with them. His work perfectly. When they are working, these speakers are really nice! The highs are fairly crisp, although the lows do have some distortion when the bass is pushed too far. By that, I mean that you sometimes need to put it lower than the recommended setting (which is only about 1/5 of the potential bass) in order to avoid some lows that are not meant to go through the bass from bleeding through. It can make the low male voices in some movies, or music sound a lot more muddy than it should be. Fortunately, this is generally the case when listening to stuff on a very loud volume setting.I would probably raise my review a star if my speakers had worked as well as my roommates. This is a great system for the price, but you are gambling on getting a good one, or a bad egg.. and from what I have read (after reading a lot of reviews on here I realized that people never really give their products time to have problems before they post a perfect review) on forums, etc. the volume control pod is a major issue ($20 replacement) and you should expect to have to replace it a minimum of one time if you are going to purchase these speakers.Update 12/12/2013:I am still using these speakers and still hold a soft spot in my heart for them. However, I would like to make an additional comment about a problem that I had overlooked when originally writing this review. The sound quality is great, but these speakers are incapable of low volume via the knobs on the front of the speaker. If you try to turn the knob below about 20% you'll hear some pretty distorted sound and it will only come out of one speaker (Mine's the left) My roommate has had the same problem and after speaking with another friend that happened to have these speakers he has experienced the same thing. This isn't a horrible issue as you can always change the sound on the computer itself and it won't impact the sound quality, but it's a definite design flaw that is really irritating if you just like to use the hardware to change your sound settings. Aside from that, I am still loving these speakers."
1389,0,"I bought 3 D-Link 7-Port USB hubs (DUB-H7) last year, for 3 different computers. (2 are in my home and one is at my dad's house)  I was instantly disappointed by the fact that this hub could not supply enough power to run an external, USB-bus-powered, laptop-sized DVD burner, with nothing else attached to the hub. (The cheap $10 7-Port hub I bought on eBay, that this hub replaced, was able to power the DVD burner, and 4 hard drives just fine until it crapped out!) I ended up having to attach that DVD-burner drive directly to one of the USB ports on the back of my computer to get it to work. After that, the D-Link seemed to work fine. UNTIL... After about 6-12 months of use, suddenly the external hard drives I had attached to the hub started randomly autonomously un-mounting, which in one case permanently damaged one of my hard drives! After a long and arduous process of elimination and lots of frustration, I finally figured out that the D-Link 7-port USB hub (DUB-H7) was the source of the problem!  Not long after that, I started having similar problems with BOTH of the other 2 D-Link 7 port hubs!  Devices kept randomly un-mounting, and not just hard drives!  In all 3 cases, USB devices that were attached close to the center of the 7 USB ports are the ones that randomly drop, while devices attached at the ends tend to not have this issue. Considering that I had this same problem on 3 identical D-Link hubs, that were all purchased separately, and all used on different computers, it seems that the odds would indicate that this is a widespread problem.I have since purchased 3 Aluratek 7-Port USB hubs (Aluratek 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub) to replace the D-Link, and it has been smooth sailing ever since (so far... 6 months and no problems yet)! The Aluratek hub supplies much more power than the D-Link did, and I can even attach my external laptop-sized DVD burner to the hub, along with 4 hard drives, an iPod Touch, a printer, and a camera, and they all work fine, simultaneously!Consequently, I would highly recommend buying the Aluratek 7-Port hub instead of this hub. I did a lot of searching before buying the Aluratek, and it seems to be the best 7-port USB hub available on the market right now.Incidentally, the following 2 7-port hubs seem to be the exact same product as the Aluratek, but are sold under different brand names.  Aluratek seems to be the Original Equipment Manufacturer however. (So that's what I'd buy)  Check out the great reviews on all 3 of these devices to get an idea of how well they work:7-Port USB 2.0 Hub, BlackCables Unlimited USB1870 USB 2.0 7-Port Desktop Hub with PowerAmazon's best price is currently on the OEM product sold by Aluratek:Aluratek 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub"
1390,0,"Fuji and Olympus have found a new way to make money and rip off innocent consumers. A new card format called xD card. A cool way to ensure royalties and extra cash.If you have already bought a xD card based camera, you are left with no choice, right ? So go ahead and buy this card, it works fine with Fuji cameras.BTW, if you haven't bought your camera till now think twice before getting a Fuji. The xD card costs 2.5 times the cost of simlar sized CF card as of this writing. And xD cards are useless outside of Fuji/Olympus cameras. Compare that to the versatality of CF cards at much lower price.Oh... and Fuji can't seem to manufacture enough quantity if these as of now, out of stock at most places ! Very bad Fuji, switch to CF/SD or watch you camera sales plummet. Today's consumer isn't a fool, he can read reviews on Amazon before buying stuff."
1391,2,"I have just converted fron a Psion to the palm about two months ago, and - I love it! The main complaint of most people (build quality) is right: Palm could have easily done better. Other than that, here are my pros &amp; cons.(+) it's compact &amp; inexpensive, so you do not have to think twice before slipping it into your pants or shirt pocket. I previously owned a palm pilot personal and the difference in size and weight is noticable - carrying the personl (or the Revo) was annoying after an hour or two, I now carry the m100 all day and hardly notice it.(+) hotsync: if you use outlook caledar, do not even consider a psion. Their synchronization software is stone age compared to hotsync &amp; pocketMirror (all included in the box).(+) batteries: a matter of personal taste I guess, but I like using a couple of AAA's for a month and than just buy new ones which can be found everywhere better than worrying about taking a charger with me when I travel.(+) 360 degrees hinge flip cover - the most functional cover I have seen so far: it's thin, sturdy, and can flip open using one hand.(*) my favorite add ons: 1) minicalc - a commercial spredsheet app. that syncs nicely with exell. 2) thinkDB - a commercial 'database' app with customizable forms &amp; filtering.(-) MIA's: e-mail sync., spelling checker, display pixel count. voice recording.(-) RAM Size: 2MB becomes marginal with the add on apps mentioned above. Had to remove AvantGo :(I'll take a star for memory size and build quality - but I never regret buying it!"
1392,0,"This camera is at least 11 years old. I'm not even kidding, I have one in my order history from February 2003. Skip this, and get something newer. I'd recommend the C920, it's cheaper ($68 right now!) AND it's better in every metric."
1393,2,The build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good. The little pouch that came with it seems nice.
1394,0,I'm starting to have issues with this after a few months of use. One end is plugged into a computer that sits on the other side of the desk. The wire is fed up and onto the top of the desk where headphones are plugged in. Sound begins to go out after a while and I have to bend the connector to get sound back. I will probably replace the female end as that's where the issue is. Cheap and poor quality.
1395,2,Strong...Samll...and a few pockets....nice.I have a Nikon D200 and 18-200mm lensThe bag works great
1396,2,"These are great little headphones for the price.  They're just like foam earplugs.  There is a proper way to squish and insert earplugs, believe it or not.  Most people just press a couple times without any thought and shove.  You have to ""roll"" these between your fingertips really well, evenly, over and over.  If you don't, they will expand too fast and you'll have trouble, especially when new.  The more you use them, the better they get until the foam finally breaks down and you go to the replacement foam.  I only use these when traveling and they knock down the noise down from planes, considerably.  These are your best bet for the money.  Ignore the reviewers that state that their double and triple priced headphone are better.  DUH!!! What would you expect!!!  If you buy a car for 10,000 don't expect 20,000 or 30,000 dollar features and performance.  Someone actually compared these to 80 dollar Shure headphones!!!  Also, any self-proclaimed, pretentious, audiophile that buys these for 10 bucks and expects audiophile performance is just being ridiculous.  Come back to Earth, please.  I have used these on all forms of media and have yet to be disappointed.  They will definitely show the flaws in any recordings because the sound is isolated and aimed directly at your eardrum.  This is one reason I would NEVER give it to a little kid.  If you like to save space on your Ipod and go with a low quality setting, your mistake will be painfully obvious.  It will also be painfully obvious when you listen to the some of the cheap/low quality recordings and incompetent audio engineers of late.These will not fit everybody's ears on the entire planet!"
1397,0,"I bought this for a laptop to do Photoshop work on when my beloved trackball broke. I thought cordless might be worth it, but this ""cordless"" requires a plug in I/O unit as big as an average mouse. Might work for a tower unit, but having a huge chunk that will hang off a PS slot and a so/so designed trackball as a separate unit i also have to haul around is a non starter. Once I saw that huge chunky plug in unit that allows this thing to be ""cordless"" it went right back into the packaging and was returned. Why would you pay more for cordless when you end up with a corded unit to power your cordless unit?"
1398,2,I was looking for a small light over-the-ear head phones to use in my office at work. Still need to hear somethings going on around me. I didn't want an expensive set that I would have to lug home with me. Researched the ratings on Amazon and thought I would take a chance. Hadn't really considered Koss in many years. I have a few different Sennheisers that I love but again wanted a small less expensive set. Right out of the box I was wowed by the sound. I am sure they will improve once they are &#34;burned in&#34;. These are very light on my head and I have been wearing them for hours without any discomfort. There is a setting on the side for light for firm pressure (the small blue tab shown in the picture just below the band). Not sure I can tell much of the difference but I set them on light. These things fold-up very small and can be stored in a small leatherette bag (not a &#34;case&#34;) and then fit great inside my desk drawer. Again these had great sound and more bass than expected of something this size and cost. Just a little tweeking with my sound settings on my SIII and I was off and running.
1399,2,"I've owned these for 22 years and still like them. They're a good compromise between tiny portable earphones and full-size home headphones. They sound good and are apparently durable, as I've been using the same pair for all these years. My only reservation is that the foam earpads tend to get damaged when you toss them in a bag with other items, so use the case. I don't remember if mine came with one. Also, consider buying the replacement earpads. I've worn a couple pair out and damaged a couple pair.It's possible that those in-ear earphones have caught up in sound quality, so consider those. I'm not in a hurry to replace my Porta Pros, though."
1400,0,"Contrary to the title, this is not an ethernet wireless bridge: don't buy if it you want to add wireless networking to an ethernet port e.g. an Xbox or Playstation.This device is something different. In fact, it's two somethings: firstly, it can be configured to be a basic access point (no firewall or routing facilities). Hook it up to your cable modem or DSL box, and have wireless access to a single computer elsewhere in your house. To be honest, there are many more powerful access point devices out there for similar $$.Alternatively, if you have one of the very limited number of supported D-Link wireless access points, this box will act as a &quot;repeater&quot;: it will accept the signal and rebroadcast it, extending the range. If that's what you need, then lucky for you and five stars for the device!"
1401,0,"I had two of these fail within a year or two. I was too lazy to pursue any sort of warranty repair/replacement. I wouldn't buy this product again. Instead, I now useHP ProCurve Switch 1400-8G 8-Port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Network Switchwhich has been flawless."
1402,2,"I have the controller on the outside of my motorcycle helmet. It's hooked up it a Pyle headphone amp and XPro speakers. Absolutely no issues with this controller. It would even work great if I was an idiot and was doing 100+ on my bike, but I would never do that. ;)"
1403,2,"First of all, unless you have a huge fetish for retro, 80's looking headphones, these headphones will not be pretty. They were created in the 80's, and because they got such a great response, the company hasn't changed anything about them - including the design. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing. For the price that you're paying (about 30 bucks), these things are 100% worth the money. They appear a little flimsy, but it's pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in. They also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it, which was really convenient for me since I got to use them for my keyboard which requires a 1/4"" stereo plug instead of a 1/8"". Furthermore, they're really not that fragile. I accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones, but it just snapped right back in and I haven't had any problems. They also have a lifetime warranty in case anything DOES happen to them, which is always a plus. Definitely a great investment."
1404,2,I listen to my TV once in a while using my bose QC15 headphones.  The problem with that set up is that volume cannot be adjusted and plays at full blast.  The Koss VC20 volume control module mitigated that issue.  Works as described.
1405,1,"OK, I came to Amazon hoping to just buy a replacement battery for my DSC-P1 and found that everyone here has the same problem I had. So I took someone's advice below and set out to drain the battery before the InfoLithium computer kicked in and stopped my fun. What I found though is that resetting the battery is a lot easier.I took about 15 pictures before the battery indicator appeared. I then realized that I was taking huge pictures and running out of memory stick space, so I paused. The battery indicator kicked in and showed 80 minutes. As I took more pictures and connected the camera to my Mac for awhile, the indicator showed nominal battery drainage and seems to be back in sync. This was a battery that seemed to be unable to hold a charge for more than three or four photos, with or without flash.So before giving up on your battery, try a quick refresh! I gave this 3 stars because it's lame that the problem kept me from using this camera for more than a year, but it was easily fixed once I knew what to do."
1406,2,"These headphones are great!  I can't compare their sound quality to those headphones costing $5-600, because I don't have that sort of cash laying around.  What I can say is that these have a very wide range of frequency response, giving clear resolution to both the highest and lowest tones, and good clarity of vocals.  They are very light weight, and do not exert much pressure on my ears, or anywhere, making them very comfortable to wear for long periods.  And, although built lightly and compactly, they do not appear to be too fragile.  They actually do easily fold up and fit inside of the included 4.5&#34; x 5.5&#34; drawstring bag, making them highly portable.  They are just what I had hoped they would be."
1407,2,"the tracks were not as large as I was hoping, I've got an hdmi and a pair of 14 guage speaker runs in them and they cannot close.  no biggie since the orientation hides the wires from sight.  they were easy enough to cut to length and there is plenty of elbows and corners to make it work over a decent run."
1408,2,"I've had these wonderful phones for three months. I use them for my ipod classic. The sound is rich and full. Strong bass with no distortion, even at high levels. Listening to Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" makes the song sound like a dream. You can hear Stevie make sighs and sounds you don't hear on the cheap ipod earbuds.And when you listen to Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick,"" it feels like you're sitting right next to John Bonham as he pounds on the drums.It's unbelievable how good these phones are. When you listen to the Counting Crows' acoustic version of ""Amiee,"" with its mandolin intro playing in the left ear, and rich acoustic guitar coming through on the right ear, you will have an eargasm, baby! It is an experience!The Portapros are also, hands down, THE most comfortable headset I've ever worn. You can adjust them to fit tighter or more loosely around the ears, and the extra padding really helps with the comfort.I should say that these are not noise cancelling or sound isolating. I can't wear them in bed at night because even with the volume 1/3rd up on the ipod, my wife can hear them. Same thing with riding the train or bus. You won't want to wear them in public, partly because they look like something worn on the set of the 1984 flick Tron, and partly because your neighbors won't want to listen to your music.But if you care about excellent quality sound, and you are not disturbing anyone, these are THE best sounding headphones you can buy under $50. They are a BIG step up from the so-so ipod earbuds and a bigger step up from anything Walmart sells.I should say that these sound better on MP3 players than they do on Hi-Fi equipment. I definitely prefer my beloved Grado SR125s for listening with my stereo or with my laptop.But the Portapros are a steal at $38.I almost forgot to mention that there is a lifetime warranty on the Portapros. If they accidently break, and you still have your receipt, Koss replaces them for free. Awesome!"
1409,2,"This notebook lock and security cable is just that, it works well and has never failed.  The one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys provided."
1410,1,"I bought this based on other's reviews its features list and the reviews on several sites. I also had a nearly expired gift certificate balance to use up. If I'd paid cash for it I may have returned it. That being said for under $13 it's a serviceable tripod. The legs at full extension feel very flimsy and in even mild wind generate shake. There's no hook (though some site's descriptions claimed there was one) to add weight to counteract this but one could easily be devised. The 'fluid' pan head is anything but, at least in the vertical, there's spots where it 'grabs' and/or sticks. Horizontal panning is acceptable. The bubble level (not mentioned in the Amazon features list) is hard to view and use. The quick release head offers no knurling for finger tightening and is recessed in the shoe requiring a screwdriver or coin to tighten though it does attach securely to the camera and tripod. Overall I'm disappointed in the quality but for what I ended up paying for it I can't complain too loudly."
1411,0,"Spent 4 hours trying to connect the D-Link 624 with the Netgear WG111 USB adapter.  Whole point is to begin using more secure WPA-PSK.  Setup works with WEP and with no security, but even a simple PSK key will not generate an IP address on the Netgear.Call D-link - they tell me they will not provide phone support for WPA questions!  Shocking!  They will send me a FAQ...I find various threads on the internet with the same problem.Also, many users have reported the router rebooting itself a lot - I had this as well.  Managed to make it go away by re-orienting the unit & antenna per several user groups recommendations, but....this seemed rather cheesy.Continuing saga...Tried to get working with DWL-G122 & WPA-PSK, after 1 RMA, D-link informs me that WPA-PSK not supported on DWL-G122, but they refuse to authorize an RMA.  Manange to get it returned from place of purchase & buy DWL-G550 from Amazon - turns out IT doesn't work with WPA-PSK either, so am returning to Amazon.  Then tried to connect my laptop from work (using Intel 2200BG) - does NOT connect with latest FW on DI-624 (2.70) - support has me downgrade to 2.50 FW and voila, now my laptop works with WPA-PSK.  This kind of grief you do not need.I am selling this router on eBay & will be buying a Linksys WRT54G - at least I can always run the Open Source code if the official Linksys code fails to work!Avoid this if you plan to use WPA"
1412,2,"Although it costs twice as much in US funds, I'm very satisfied. My first pair had a button to stop sounds and extra plugs plus a case. It broke two months after, since I tied it to make it shorter. One side wasn't functionning well because of that. I used it in the plane and it blocked 70% of the engine noise! Economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports. Also the plastic dried up(I don't know why!).My tip: never tie the wires! it causes the metalic wires inside to break. Because of this, it costs me hundreds of dollars.My second set was simpler, but at the same price as my first. No more annoying button to stop music. The tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubber(unlike totaly in plastic) so it's improved. The extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that I can't use. The main problem is that sometimes I sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breaks.Second tip: I have two versions, blue/yellow and purple/gray. What you get in the package is sorta different so choose carefully! The mute button can be easily pressed... so it's a small hint.Third tip: if it doesn't fit, change the plugs or turn and push it in your ear. It doesn't really fit when only pushed.Fourh tip: smaller plugs are better for best sound proof and quality.Finally: the plugs with break down, piece by piece, until it doesn't fit if you unplug and plug them often. The mute button was meant for that if it helps you purchase.I'll only buy these kind of earphones since it's like plugging your ears with rubber corks and istening to music at the same time. The price in Canada is kinda steep... if you buy it here you save 40%(with the currency and taxes)!"
1413,0,"This lens is worth about what you pay for it.  It's very soft around the edges when wide open.  Optics are so-so, but the build quality is very cheap.  I think someone else likened it to a ""Cracker Jack Toy"".  That pretty much sums it up.  This lens, if put to good use in the field, would literally fall apart.  It felt so ""cheap"" in my hands...rattle...creaking, loose, cheap.  I got rid of it just as quick as I bought it."
1414,0,"I agree that it worked well and immediately, but I felt like its door was going to break off from the first time I used it. I don't travel much any more so I won't be worrying about a laptop, but I would be surprised if that door would travel very well. Even connected to my desktop at home, I felt as if I was going to break off the door just brushing against the cable. I used it a couple of hours and then returned it."
1415,2,"Great sound for the price. Plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling! For $10 you get something that paying $100 wouldn't compete with.I've traveled with my friend and his high dollar Bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable (since the don't sit in the ear) the isolation was just as good.Mine wore out after a little over a year, so I mailed them back to Koss since they have a lifetime warranty, and I got a new pair.Can't beat that.Only downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little sore."
1416,2,"These were easy enough to install.  I used a hacksaw to cut them (easily) and a file to file the frayed edges and they look great.  I did have them fall down off the wall once or twice so far, but after pressing them back on they seem to be holding up okay.  No regrets.  If I need some more in the future I'll probably buy another set."
1417,1,I bought both and did my own listening test.Sony MDR-XD200 MDRXD200the sound is rich and immersive. mp3 files sound really good. it hides the mp3 artifacts for low quality files. voices sound very perfect and deep with great range. the letter s and the letter f are wet it does not sound like a whistle. I can listen to youtube videos. which are low quality. and still feel like they are high quality. basically the sony makes low quality files sound high quality and rich and very very rich which is amazing. It has a bigger more comfortable cup. The only drawback is that it doesn't block outside noise. overall the sony is more comfortable and I can wear it for longer periods and the loudness of the volume is very moderate and comfortable. for example. I could put the volume really high and still be able to listen to it without feeling annoyed.Sennheiser HD 202 HD202the sound is more live and near. not as immersive. you can clearly hear mp3 artifacts. in fact even high quality mp3 files sound pitched with squeekiness. voices sound too squeeky clear. the letter s and the letter f are heard in a high end pitch. like the letter s is more squeeky and not wet. it sounds like someone is blowing a whistle into your year which I don't like. the only benefit the HD 202 has is that it is a closed cup so outside noise is muffled out. It has a smaller cup compared to the sony. the sennheiser at loud volumes sounds annoying.I also got J2 earbuds and koss clipon sports earpads which I both didn't like. The Sony MDR-XD200 is better but they are both good for the price. I would use the Sennheiser outside and the Sony at indoors.
1418,0,"My Fellowes Surge protector was taken right of the box brand new from the Amazon packaging and plugged into an electical outlet.  POP.  Lights and everything electronic in the room stops.  Hmmm.  Reset the breaker.  Plug it into a different outlet... POP!  Hmm.  Reset.  Plug this item into an outlet other side of the house... POP!So to double check everything, plug this device into an outlet at a friends home...  same thing.. POP!Obviously my unit had some kind of internal short circuit right out of the box and was completely unusable.A new one might have worked great, but in my situation I sent it back to Amazon and will spend a couple dollars more and buy the 12 outlet 2,400 joule surge protector from Belkin instead.Thank God for great customer service from Amazon.com!"
1419,2,"For fans of electronics, particularly bleeding-edge, technologically packed gadgets, nothing is sadder than knowing your particularly product is past its prime.Such is the case with Sony's DCR-VX2000.This is not to say that Sony's 3-CCD ""prosumer"" Mini-DV digital camcorder isn't a good product. For those familiar with ""The Blair Witch Project"", that film was shot with the VX1000, the predecessor to this model. The VX2000 outdoes that previous model by adding digital snapshots that can be stored on Sony Memory Sticks, along with a 2.5"" foldout LCD viewscreen. This is not your average consumer camcorder.Having three CCD imaging chips, each one dedicated to red, green, or blue light, puts this in a league with cameras that you'll see in TV studios. You'll find other pro features such as digital image stabilization, built-in digital effects, titling capability, timers, zebra, shutter speed choices, built-in manual and automatic mic leveling, focus locks, auto and manual focus on the 48x zoom, color viewfinder, neutral density filters, spotlighting and backlighting controls, fade in and out - the list goes on and on.Once you've captured the video, you have several ways of transferring it to other media via one of several ports: RCA, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and S-Video. Playback is via the unit and it sports a full complement of VCR-like controls. The unit also comes with a very powerful remote that can control virtually every capability of the camera in both playback and recording modes. It takes Mini-DV tapes in 60 minute lengths, but can record 90 minutes when selecting tape speeds. Tests have shown virtually no image degradation and only a slight loss in sound quality when recording at the slower 90 minutes speed.Few camcorders can touch the battery life (an astonishing 9 hours on a single charge with the optional NP-F960 battery) or the actual image on tape. I've never seen a consumer camera with such beautiful color rendition or sharpness. Everyone who sees recordings made by this camera is amazed.But as I mentioned before, while state of the art in 2001, changes in digital video technology are rendering the VX2000 old news. This unit cannot record video that takes advantage of HDTV as its resolution is not high enough for that new standard. JVC has recently released a model ...that has similar capability to the VX2000, but adds HDTV. Panasonic is also changing the game by eliminating the achilles heels of the VX2000 and all other camcorders: the tape transport mechanism. They've announced a completely solid state camera that records onto a series of compact memory media similar to the Memory Stick in the VX2000. (The Memory Stick on the VX2000 is only for snapshots, not video.) Since the most likely parts of any electronic device to fail are the mechanical ones, having no transport mechanism means a far more reliable unit. Such a system also does away with tapes, another weakness.With this in mind, the ideal customer for the VX2000 has a dilemma: with new technology on the market, but priced a bit higher for now, is it wise to buy the VX2000?There are other issues, too. The vast majority of people will be satisfied with the capability of single-CCD units. Some of Sony's single-CCD units are mind-blowingly tiny, far smaller than the very bulky VX2000. They also take higher resolution snapshots than the VX2000, something to keep in mind if you want a digital camera and a digital camcorder in one unit.Do I recommend the VX2000? Absolutely. It is a stunningly powerful and capable camcorder. However, it is getting long in the tooth and no longer is the unit of choice for consumers who want the cream of the crop and the latest technology."
1420,2,"Does what it's supposed to.  I wish it was wireless, but that option is not available for my model camera, unfortunately."
1421,2,Easy to use. Useful for tripod shooting and long exposures. It is good paired with a wireless remote.Cable could be longer.
1422,2,"I bought another bag for my Canon DSLR but it was too bulky so I was looking for something smaller. This looked appealing so I bought it. I looked at a ton of bags before this one. The interior size is a bit smaller than I thought and when taking out one insert fits the DSLR with the 18-55 lens sideways and a bit snug and then fits a telephoto next to it, but very tight. You wont be able to get anything else inside. However it does have a lot of pocket space and is compact enough and stylish to be carried all the time. I like the clasps on this as well, very durable metal and the canvas is very thick and durable and nice colors."
1423,1,"First of all, this product was hyped up too much. It was supposed to be small and state of the art with a large hardrive. The only truth to that statement is that it has a large hard drive. The surfing of this product is god aweful. For 20gb of music, you would expect a much better system. A system like the Nomad Jukebox 3 is great. I bought this when it first came out...The size is akward. They say its dimensions are smaller than any other 20gb HD based mp3 player. THere is some truth, but the fact is, is that it is FAT!!! Dang. The jukebox may be bigger, but it is thinner and much more streamline and much easier to cary. Also the dials seem flimsy and with one drop they feel like they could break.Pros:*Big HD*Big Screen*EQ settings*AccessoriesCons:*Size*Sound Quality(OK...)*Make (Cheap)*Bad song surfing*Battery*USB is slow (no firewire)*Can only transfer songs with given softwareOverall, I do think that if you buy this, don't expect to be satisfied...Serously, this item is not worth [the price] and is more like a beta edition than a final edition..."
1424,1,"I guess I was hoping for some of the midrange clarity that Bose speakers are able to get in this price range.  The sound is okay.  Volume is good but when I turn the knob, I don't like its stiff feel and it makes noise on adjustment.  Maybe I got a defective unit?  The reviewers that comment about the bass being muddy are understated.  The subwoofer simply adds mud to the sound rather than any kind of bass definition.  Not a happy camper here."
1425,2,I really liked this mouse but thought it would last longer than it did.  Loved all the different uses it has on it
1426,2,"The mount consists of two pieces.  One piece fastens onto your handlebars.  It attaches very firmly and will prevent the unit from moving even over the roughest terrain.  The other piece replaces the standard battery compartment cover on the GPS.  When you want to mount the GPS to your bike you just snap the two components together.I was impressed by the quality of the pieces and suspect that it will be very durable.  I only have two negative comments regarding this design.  First, the handlebar mounting piece is tightened on via a screw.  I have a road and a mountain bike and will want to switch the unit between the two.  I would have preferred some sort of quick release mechanism that does not require the use of tools.  Secondly, I wish that the battery cover did not have to be replaced with the new one.  The one that comes with the bike mount is not rubberized and it has a clip on it that could catch on things.  That means that you'll want to put the original cover back on the GPS if you want to use it as a hand-held.  Having to use two different covers means that there is just one more piece that you'll need to remember to bring on your trips - and one more thing to possibly lose somewhere.Despite these gripes, I am very impressed with the mount and can recommend it."
1427,1,If you have a bigger head than average I suggest looking for a different set of headphones.  I loved these for about 20 minutes and then started to get a headache do to the pressure on either side of my head.  The sound is great though!
1428,2,"I have been using it for almost a month now and it's been a great help to me when taking night photos. I only wish it can do more.It's compatible with Canon EOS Rebel XTi,XSi,XS, and the latest Rebel T1i, also compatible with EOS Rebel G, EOS Elan II, EOS Elan IIe, and EOS IX. Great price. Thanks to Amazon and Adorama. If you'll ask if I will recommend this, Yes I will recommend this.You can see some of the photos I've taken at [...]"
1429,1,"This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams.  The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos.  With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head.  It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy."
1430,0,"These speakers appeared to be a good basic pair of speakers for those who want a no-frills, inexpensive system.  They look pretty nice, admittedly.  Power is drawn through a USB port, which is a nice idea - no bulky transformer.  And herein lies the problem.Power from the USB port needs to be filtered; on these speakers, it is definitely not.  They hiss, crack, and transmit/amplify every electronic interference signal that comes out of your PC.  Move your mouse, and you hear clicking. CD-ROM usage is even worse.  The noise renders the speakers unusable, for even the most patient among us.For the price, they're not even worth the effort to return ship them.  These are totally unusuable and going straight into the trash."
1431,2,This Barlow gives close up views of planetary and deep space objects at a reasonable price.  Quality appears to be good and the Barlow may enable my son and I to dable in astrophotography.
1432,1,"but one thing I never see mentioned is that the display is extremely hard to see, especially at night.  The backlight, even with battery at full power, stinks.  I am replacing my batteries weekly to maintain a backlight that is half way reasonable because I watch television primarily at night.I actually have a flashlight on my coffee table so I can see the display.Other than this, I agree with the other reviews.  But if you can't see it, how good is it?"
1433,2,"I love this remote control for simple remote shooting. It works only in front or side of camera though.Its light weight and easily hidden in palm but also easy to lose.Mine broke after one week because I dropped it, no warranty or repairs from canon, so consider this a disposable remote control which is why I think its too expensive for $20.00.I had to get another one but shop around to get it &lt; $20.00."
1434,2,"Simple and stable design. Wide palm rest, very natural and comfortable feel. Wish there were back and forward buttons. Many options for configuring pointer movement and actions.Battery cover difficult to open, was concerned about breaking it.Make sure to position the receiver with ample open space around it (not next to other devices), or mouse movements may be erratic."
1435,1,I got the 16 gauge 100ft spool for my new surround speakers. I'm rating this as 3 stars as the cable is thinner than the usual 16 awg that I've used before plus it is more fragile and hard to remove the plastic cover without cutting at least a few copper strands. I was using a cable cutter and it still took me several tries in order to remove the cover without cutting at least 1  strand. For the rest of my setup I got thisB0044YPN0Aand I'm much happier. They are the same price too so I highly recommend the media bridge over the RCA.
1436,2,"Shooting macro and long exposures with your Canon APS camera is much easier with this remote. But while it is more pleasant to use than the 2 second timer, it is an extra part to carry, so sometimes I forget or don't bother using it. Also, an infrared remote is more versatile since it lets you take shots of yourself as well.This switch is essential if you wish to shoot bulb."
1437,2,"If you want a buffer between you and the audio source, get this product. Well made and it will save your hearing."
1438,1,"These sound amazing, but look kinda goofy when on your head. The cord is also super thick and super long (coiled bungie style) Best sound quality I've ever personally heard from headphones but are really designed for sound board ppl or studio use. Not every day walking to class type like I was hoping and looking for."
1439,0,"First of all, FWIW, I listen to classical music, especially to opera.I had an awesome Sennheiser HD433. Unfortunately they don't make this model anymore. I went to a store that carries Sennheisers and tried one headphone after another to check which one comes close to the HD433. The salesperson was also impressed by the quality of HD433 (I brought with me to compare) and agreed to no headphone came closer, even the most expensive ones. This PX100 sounded the best of them and I bought a pair of those. In the first couple of days I was impressed, then, all of the sudden the sound quality started to deteriorate. The bass started to be too powerful, the treble was gone and the midrange with no significant presence. I am very disappointed with this headphone and I am willing to resume my hunt for another headphone that gives me the pleasure that the HD433 did."
1440,1,"Like many of the other reviewers, I found the sound quality produced by these headphones to be top notch. If I were judging on that alone, for the price, these headphones would get 5 stars.  I use them for gaming, listening to music, and watching movies occasionally.  The bass is deep, detailed, and rich.  The highs are well acentuated and not too ""sharp"".  And the mids are not muddled.  They also seal out sound very well; even at a moderate volume level, it's hard to hear my wife talking to me 6-7 feet away.However, I find that the biggest deficiency is the comfort. The plastic body of the headphone is not adjustable (width-wise) and the tension they provide is just too much to bear for long term use, especially since I wear glasses.  Bear in mind, I don't think that I have a particularly big head (5'9"", 170 lbs), but the tension is just way too high compared to previous models I've owned.My only other complaint is that the wires go to each ear piece instead of having one wire (and running it through the headband to the other ear piece).So in summary, highly recommended...if you have a small head :)"
1441,0,"I had this product for over 2 weeks. I have a brand new computer wth Windows 7 and three times I had issues with either the mouse not working or the keyboard stop working.In addition, the power cord in the back of the unit falls out, I had to tape it down.  In summary, this product is junk like most of the USB hubs out there, a lot of folks have problems with them (if not now, later they will)--- I'm going back to manually move out USB jacks when i need them. The quality is not there for these products yet, i mean they charge $15-$30 for this stuff, your not getting reliablity! They either burn out and/or disconnect periodically.  I rather pay $100 for a commerical grade product, get it over with and not have the headaches."
1442,2,"This case fits well, and works nicely to protect the GPS.The only issue I have with it is the stiching on the front window has started to come a little loose at the top.  TO BE FAIR, I could be the culprit as I tend to pull the top flap firmly when seating the GPS into the pouch, so it could be attributed to my own actions.It still works great, I am just a little more careful about pulling on it now.  The stiching is holding fine, and the case works great.Be aware also, that due to its design (which is sort of necessary based on the key placement of the GPS), the top corners of the GPSr are still vulnerable to drops.  So if you want something to completely surround your GPS, this isn't it.  I wouldn't object if they cahnged the design slightly to widen the top flap so that it would reach the corners a little more.Overall a great little case for the money."
1443,0,"People should be warned.  Terrible product.  Terk should be ashamed.  The signal relay is very unreliable, even when the units are right next to each other and you're holding the remote 2 feet away from the transmitter.  Just awful."
1444,2,"I've had 2 other pair of these headphones, and I've never been disappointed. The sound's great and they seem to last forever. The other 2 pair? My wife got one and my daughter got the other. They're especially good if earbuds don't work for you ... like they fall off your head a lot.Sennheiser MX-100s have great sound, too, but I had 2 pair of those and in both cases, the sound on one side went out. The first time, I got another pair of MX-100s, but the second time, I got the Porta-Pro. Can't imagine you'd be disappointed with these ... except maybe aesthetically. They do look a bit utilitarian."
1445,0,"Some 15-20 h over a 2-month period was spent trying to program this device and get it to connect to the internet through a separate modem. It never worked, even with downloaded instruction materials from Netgear website and a couple of phone calls and emails from tech staff who sincerely tried to help.  Finally boxed the unit and sent back to Netgear. No response from Netgear since sending."
1446,2,Who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version?
1447,2,"As A Professional Audio Engineer, And An Amateur Photographer, I Take Many Pictures At Concerts...Kodak Is Good, But Never Comes Out Very Colourful, And The Generics Just Plain Suck...Fuji Film Really Brings Out All The Coloured Lights...The Oversaturation Of Colour Is Great, But Sometimes Unwanted...Agfa Is Good All Around Film, With Excellent Sharpness, But Tends To Be Expensive...Fuji Film Rules..."
1448,2,"I've found that the switch/trigger is quite sensitive and it likes to get in the ""lock"" position quite easily.  Other than that, this is a quality Canon product!Pros:  It's a remote shutter release.Cons:  Short cord, gets tangled & twisted up easily."
1449,0,"I bought this URC 8910 remote control becuase my old remote (a One For All Cinema 7) was never able to operate my Sony STR-K740P stereo receiver and would not operate my new Toshiba D-VR3SU DVD Recorder/VCR (it did work with my old Philips/Magnavox DVD player).  Of the three items which I needed the URC 8910 to control (the two mentioned above and a Toshiba 20AF42 TV), the remote was only able to operate the TV.I tried every code listed in the manual for the other two devices, and not one of the codes worked.  I then tried the remote's code search ability, without any luck.  Finally I called customer service to get the unit upgraded over the phone.  It took five days just to get through to customer service (due to a ""higher volume of customer service calls than usual""), and once I was able to actually talk to someone, the unit could not be upgraded over the phone.  Two different customer service reps tried the upgrade process 5 or 6 times each, it failed every time.Finally, the second rep told me that the upgrade process very often will not work over a cordless phone, and that it never works over a digital phone system, a phone system with DSL, or a filtered phone line.  I have a 5.8GHz cordless phone using Digital phone service, so the upgrade process apparently will not work.  She did thoughtfully suggest that I could pump coins into a pay phone for the 30 minutes or so (don't forget that you will pay for the time that you are on hold waiting for someone to answer) long distance phone call that each previous upgrade attempt took.So my advice is do not waste your money on this remote control if you have relatively recent equipment which will not respond to any of the built in codes, and if you do not have an old fashioned, non-digital, corded phone with which to upgrade the unit.  It may be perfectly fine otherwise, but in my case at least it was a complete waste of money."
1450,1,"I received this backpack from work to carry my laptop in and while its a nice sturdy backpack (lets see how it holds up over time) it simply does not have enough room for anything more than a laptop. I'm the kind of woman who doesn't carry a purse if she has a backpack, it looks silly to me to be walking around with a backpack and a massive purse...you look like a bag lady and seriously, no one needs that much space for stuff. But this barely has enough room for a 15 inch laptop, a charger, a notepad and a wallet, forget about putting a sweatshirt or lunch in it. While I can make the lack of room work on some days, its really the poor placement of the laptop carrier that annoys me the most. It isn't a dedicated sleeve that is usually located in a padded section in the back of the backpack. This one only has a cheaply made, thin nylon zip sleeve that flops around the bag. Your laptop really is not protected in this backpack so be careful about where and how hard you toss it. Whenever I put the backpack on, I hear this loud zipping sound...its the sound of my straps loosening up. I have to tighten them at least 3 times a day. I'd say this works well for quick trips or someone who needs a simple starter backpack but I would recommend spending the extra $10-$15 for a better quality backpack."
1451,0,"I bought this last week looking for a rugged player.  I read the reviews here and saw some people say it stunk some people said it was great.  The first time i used it i was thrilled!  And thought the nay-sayers were idiots.  Well, after about 3 hours use it started to sound like an old walkman on low batteries.  You know, &quot;I got one hand in my pooccckkkeeettt annddd thheee ottther one haling a taxi cab&quot;.  Not only that but whenever the volume was at 25 or higher it randomly pauses!  Also, the casing is incredably cheap.  Anyway, I took it back to bestbuy (where i got it) and but the Creative Labax muavo nx 128.  So far, I highly recommened it over this product, even though you gotta pay more.  and oh yeah, ALWAYS buy extended warrantines on ANY mp3 player :)"
1452,1,"I don't have any complaints about the sound, they sound good.  Only problem is that they become uncomfortable to wear after about a half hour.  The ear cups are too small and the fit is tight, so your ears start hurting as they are being mashed against your head.  I've got a pretty average head and ears, so unless you have little ears or not using these for more than 30min at a time, I'd go for another pair."
1453,2,"The stereo preamp, once a standard item in any serious hi-fi setup, has become difficult to find of late. This is the only one I know of that's still in production and that's intended for home use. It already seems a little dated, with its dedicated input for lazerdiscs (remember those?). But. it's a good, basic unit, although you'll need a separate phono cartridge amp for your vinyl collection. Also, the stated power rating of the switched outlet is too low to handle a large power amp."
1454,2,"good in all respects for a rebel - sized DSLR w/extra lens BUT (only one review mentions this) there are no pockets whatsoever.So SD/CF cards, lens tissue, whatever, must find a place elsewhere (eg, an outboard lens case).  This is a shame as it would have been so easy to include a zippered top or front pocket.  other than than, it's fine."
1455,0,"Perhaps it is just my head, but this did not fit me well and I stopped using it immediately."
1456,0,"As others have mentioned, this camera, along with a slew of others from Canon have a CCD problem relating to heat.  I just experienced this problem and called Canon per their website.I made the mistake of referring to the ""product recall"" to which I was endlessly chastised by the customer service rep because it is really a ""product advisory.""  (I originally bought the camera for over $700, now I'm being treated like trash because I used the wrong words... nice.)In returning the camera for service, I was told not to use the original packaging and that I should bubble wrap it and place nothing around it in a large box.  (so it can fly around inside)  They pay for UPS shipping, which she said takes 7-10 days.Once they receive it, they will determine if heat caused the problem or if the CCD is broken.  If it's broken, then I have to pay.  Considering that they want it to be flung around inside a large box during shipping, I can see where this is going.I would not recommend this camera for this problem alone and would not recommend Canon products at all due to their customer service anymore."
1457,2,"I was in need of cable runs to hide speaker wire along a ceiling beam. A few of these kits happily allowed me to do multiple complex angles and flush speaker wires against the ceiling and down to multiple speakers.1-star deducted because some of the adhesive material failed after around 12 months, however I only had to replace one section and the rest has so far held up just fine. While no replacement for screw-in rails, these plastic runs work just fine for most home applications."
1458,2,I bought this to be able to control audio volume.  Similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated; Koss is built much better and so far so good.  No complaints.
1459,2,"Well made bag with all metal hooks. Generous padings all around.I'm a hobbiest photographer, I don't have that much gear to go around with. The main compartment of the bag is an exact fit for my 550D with lens and lens cap on (17-40mm f4 L). Front compartment fits lens back cap, camera body cap, 2x AA flash light. I managed to squeeze in a lens cleaning pen. The charger, my 50mm f1.8 lens, laptop and tripod goes in my backpack. For $25 bucks this bag is very well made, just wish it were a little bigger."
1460,0,"At first I really liked these, but they did not last very long despite the fact that I took very good care of them. Disappointing given the high price."
1461,0,"I bought the ML-L3 to shoot my Nikon D80 when I am not close enough to use the Nikon cord MC-DC1, and after using it, I have mixed feelings about it. This little remote is not quite an extension of the shutter.Pros.1.On my D80 I have shoot pictures 13m (40ft)away from the camera which can be very useful -IF you are on the IR receiver side of the camera (right or left of the lens)Cons.1.If you are not in front of the camera it does not work, no matter if you are a foot behind it.2.The receiver in the Nikon D80 is on the left side of the lens, SOOO if you stand on the right side and the lens is in between, it does not work.3.You cannot prefocus as you do with the cable -hey but is not quite necessary.One thing I cannot review is the life of the battery, maybe in an update.Anyway, in few words it works if NOTHING is in between you and the IR receiver of the body, no matter if it is a twig, which gives you very little versatility, little room to work. I remmember the remote control of a sony tv from 20 yrs ago and you could point on a wall and the bounced signal would command the tv. This is a toy version of a good IR remote."
1462,2,...but it only seems to work if you are pretty much dead-on square to the camera.  I was hoping for wider area coverage.
1463,2,The carring case protects from scratches and you can carry it on your belt by your side. You can operate the GPS with out taking it out ofthe case.
1464,2,"Better sound than I expected for the price I paid. They collapse easily, take up little space, and I don't have to shove them in my ears, which is nice."
1465,0,"The construction of this jump drive is pathetic. Also, I recently lost everything I had stored on it.  I have a simpletech 256mb usb2 drive and the construction of it is 1o times better!  Go with Simpletech, you'll be glad you did!"
1466,2,"Durable comes to mind when receiving this product. Easy to install and uninstall. For the price a most have, and a great buy."
1467,2,"I've used this to shoot video and stills.  It does not have a fluid head but it nevertheless pans and tilts VERY smoothly.  There are better tripods out there although for much higher prices.BTW, There's a reason they named it ""VideoMate..."".  I've used it many times for still photos and in most situations that I've used it -- the tripod works fine. But this tripod was not designed for still photography.  Almost everyone who purchased this would probably realize that this tripod is primarily intended for video.  All one has to do is to notice at the name of it."
1468,1,"If you have realistic expectations for these speakers (I have the RC60i) you'll be happy.  They are a little weak when it comes to producing bass, but otherwise they have decent sound quality.  If your looking for something with a bit more bass, check out my review of the JBL SP8CII 2-Way speakers, they are significantly better."
1469,1,"The power center works well allthough I have not had any electrical storms or faults to truly test it yet.  The few areas that I would take issue with are1)the outlets in my house are the rectangular ""designer"" kind with no screw in the middle.  The AV 200 uses a screw in the center to secure it to the wall outlet.  I have not had issues with it falling out but could be a problem.2) Would not fit behind my main TV because of the tight space between the outlet on the wall and where the TV is hung.3) As with all Monster Power products I have, the recepticles are extremely hard to insert a plug into.  I guess it is better then falling out but they need to find a happy medium between not falling out and forcing in."
1470,2,nice to control flashes and play with light for creative photography.. keep in mind it need batteries which is not included and you need to order them separately.
1471,2,"Economical way to make any headphones volume controllable. Works great and delivery was swift. Although it is compact, it seems sturdy enough to last for years."
1472,2,I own 3 pairs of these now and am totally satisfied with them.  I have probably about 25 sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes.  Not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes I use these for (casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation) these are perfect. They're the only device I'll use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop.  I love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your ears.
1473,2,"I purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed.  They do not have the best high range, but decent.  Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style.  They performed so well, that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his.  When I called him out on the retro style, he shrugged and said &#34;have you heard these?&#34;  Enough said!"
1474,0,"At first, these hubs worked great.  Then slowly but surely, they started to fail.  D-Link is a reputable company, so I was surprised by the sudden failure of the devices.  I kept my older version of the USB Hubs (grey metal as opposed to black plastic), reinstalled them, and they work just great (the 1.0 and 1.1 USB ones) (I hardly throw anything away, fortunately).The reason I bought these is that they claim to power iPad, iPod devices.  They have a note saying that the computer will say it is not charging, when it actually is.  Well, after my iPad would not charge, I said, Okay, I can still use these for general purposes.Please note: FOUR of these devices failed at different times.  I tested each one at a time to determine if there was an overload fault of some kind; tested them on other computers, just to see if there were any kind of driver problems, or other compatibility problems.  Once these puppies are dead, they stay dead.I do not recommend these devices, and I recommend that you do not acquire them."
1475,2,it was a great buy and at a great price I saw the exact one at wal-mart for $40! so yea if your looking for a beginner bag this is the way to go!
1476,0,"I had the same experience as another reviewer here, the sleeves smell very strong (I put them out in the garage till I can return them). I bought these elswhere but came here to see if others had the same experience & low & behold yes they did! To me its almost a musty odor probably has something to do with them having to be shipped from Taiwan! The sleeves I've bought in the past were made by ""Ampad"" here in the US, I'll go back to buying their brand."
1477,2,I like this wireless remote. Now i don't have to rush to my spot in 10 seconds.
1478,0,Bought this cable to use with a 250 gb usb drive. It was enough to power the hard drive but not enough for windows to detect the drive. I ended up using it to connect a printer. Not recommended for connecting hard drives or for high speed data transmission. You get what ya pay for I guess.
1479,2,"I have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with C-net before I purchased anything. I am so glad that I got these, they are so very comfortable (even with brand new ear piercings) and sound incredible. I am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty."
1480,0,"I have to agree with other reviewers. However to show a couple GOOD points- it's compact, and has a nice quiet zoom. However it's price range is really not worth it."
1481,1,Not a bad set of cans for the price.  Don't expect miracles.  Fairly comfortable.  Would have liked a better cord wrap.
1482,2,"I've had my Koss PortaPro headphones for about eight years now. They've served me well. I purchased them in Circuit City (one of the only local places where one could find them eight years ago) and they have traveled from iPod to iPod, served in some mild studio work, and have basically been the best set of headphones I've ever had. They sound great, they're comfortable, and they are durable.There's not much more to say. They're starting to wear out just now, and I guess I'll be forced to buy a new set from Amazon (or invoke Koss' lifetime warranty) within the next year or two. It's good that they're a bit easier to acquire now, and the price is about right.I'm no audiophile, but I do believe most people will find the Koss PortaPro headphones to be superior to just about anything in the same price range."
1483,1,"Worked as advertised.  I haven't used it much, we just don't need this item any more, so I gave it away."
1484,1,"My Nikon D3100 lens cap doesn't really have an area big enough for the ""sticky"" tab to fit on this and still look professional (looks like a giant sticker covering my Nikon logo); so that's why the 3 stars, other than that seems to do fine for now. I'd prefer to be able to stash the lens cap somewhere that's more out of the way other than dangling from the camera personally... So I'm still looking for a better solution."
1485,2,A corded remote switch is a must have for any tripod photography.  Cable could be a  couple of feet longer.
1486,2,"I felt inclined to write a review because I was so impressed by these headphones... I had tried a bunch in the process looking for headphones in the $150 range, tried Bose OE ($180), Sony XB700 ($90), Pioneer Home Theater A1000 ($95), Sony V700 ($85)... Out of the more expensive headphones I thought the Bose OE sounded the best (very clean crisp highs, and great bass and VERY comfortable).The only headphones that came close to the Bose OE (in terms of sound) were these Koss Portapros and they cost 1/6th the price!! Some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something?? Totally untrue, the headphones feel and look great, are comfortable enough for a good couple hours, and sound amazing!Even if you plan to buy some expensive headphones I really think you should have a pair of these... I actually just ordered a $350 pair of Denon d2000, but I don't regret the Portapros one bit, they are awesome, great bass, good mids and highs (albeit not as good as the Bose, but close enough considering the drastic price difference).Update (after 1 month use): Recently I purchased some Denon d2000 and Beyer Dynamic t990 (both retail over $300) I still can't believe how good the Koss stand up to them. For fun I tried connecting the Koss to my Nuforce uDac-2 HP (amp/dac) and they sound even better; mind you the Denons and Beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the Koss it's worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hi-fi headphones. Still impressed!"
1487,0,"These headphones don't do what they are supposed to, cancel external noise. On top if it adds it own hiss. In other words, you are better off using a regular pair of headphones (or one of the noise blocking earbuds) than these ""noise-cancelling"" ones. I bought mine about three years back, had thrown them into my basement because they did not work, but just rediscovered them after moving to a new place. I'm astonished this model is still selling. Don't buy it; I'm about to try the Sony MDR-NC6."
1488,1,These are ok earbuds.  they are a little slick so if you start to sweat they will want to slide out of your ears
1489,0,"This item doesn't work. I tried to use it with a DVI source to output to VGA. I'm an IT Manager and seller of electronics, so I tried every trick in the book. No dice."
1490,1,"Installed these into my ceiling for a 5.1 setup ... using Polk Monitor 70's in the front with CS2 center channel. Since my attic has blown insulation, I built enclosuers (1.47 cubic feet each) that drop between the rafters with openings just big enough so that I can still mount the speakers on the dry wall. I only notice the speakers once or twice during a movie ... helicpoters, gun shots, etc. But other than that I can't even tell there anything there.Speakers where easy to install, grill come off with little effort, but just not much sound coming from them even after adjusting the surround L/R speaker levels on my reciever ... maybe the M70's are just too over powering for these surrounds. I'm glad I didn't go with the Tc80's ... I cant image them being any much better than these."
1491,0,"1 star only because you can't opt to choose no stars.I bought this thing about a year ago. I wanted a small camera to keep in my every day carry bag and figured this would be cool since it was small and cheap.I got it, loaded the crummy software, took ssome sample pictures, hooked it up to the computer and nothing. I have yet to be able to get the picture of this thing. I don't know if it's a problem with the software or the camera itself but after several attempts I just put it in the closet and forgot about it."
1492,0,"I really wanted to like these headphones. They're distinctively dorky, cheap(ish), and sound awesome. Unfortunately, they also hurt my ears... a lot! I kept them for two weeks in hopes that I would be able to ""break them in,"" but it's no use. They're going back to Amazon tomorrow."
1493,0,"i used this camcorder indoors for a recital and the picture quality was just so poorly, that the tape was useless. Luckily i used a 4 year old Sony DV as backup, where the picture quality was superb, compared to Canon.  I think Canon ZR70 is ok for outdoor usage and greatly priced. On the positive side, i like the great zoom and the ease of use. I think its a good Camcorder for starters or for creative Kids. The Remote is poorly as well, the buttons are so small and not good aranged and hard to find."
1494,1,"Hello,I purchased these speakers at amazon.com for a knockdown holiday sale price of $29.99 (Oct. 2004), they came in today and I tried them with some basic techno, metal and rock music. The sound quality is good. Also, the set up was a breeze, just plugged in the basic items to each other, and the best part was that the power cord doesnt have a large bulky adapter which would have hogged space at the power outlet.I also wish the speakers (not the woofer) could be of a bit higher wattage. The RMS (Root mean square) power is indeed below average. But note that RMS power is not the only consideration when purchasing the speakers, quality factor (Q) ratings and fidelity are very much more important than any thing else. A good example would be those tiny Bose speakers which deliver absolutely divine and crisp music.Addendum: I recently got a HUGE Home theatre system 800Watts - Sony. After listening to that... this speaker system sounds like an orphan crying in the scottish moors. Distant and not very pronounced.Look, if you are not crazy about too much sound... then this unit is good (when priced below $35.00).Otherwise go for a higher wattage system. and also go 5.1  surround sound systems.... you will enjoy the difference every single day."
1495,2,"This review is for the Koss Volume Control only.A volume control that I can reach anytime, and it works.A volume control for all devices, and it has the 3.5mm mini-plug. The control includes a clip to attach it to any clothing, too.This is the best separate volume control I have found. I use it with my headphones, and control volume on all my devices with it. It makes changing the volume very easy. Mine did come with a straight plug on the end, instead of the angled plug as shown in the image.This volume control worked better than I expected. I can now control the volume on each device I use with the same control. Instead of trying to remember all the volume controls and where they are, I plug this into my headphones and use it with everything. Other than the plug being straight, there were no surprises.Having tried many volume controls, both separate and integrated, I found this one very easy to use. It is much better than most of the controls out there. Set the volume up fairly loud, and then use this to control it as needed. It works great."
1496,1,"The sound quality is great. I have had no problems with that or product quality. These have lasted me a long time. I also love the in-line volume control. I hate having to take out my iPod every time I want to make a change, and this allows me to put on my music, lock my iPod, and use the earbuds exclusively. The carrying case is nice and keeps the earbuds protected. However, the bad...These are not very comfortable. Right when I put them in they're okay but not the best. Then after long use they start hurting my  ears. I can't pinpoint the problem, but I think they're just a little too big. If you're looking for something comfortable, I'd head in a different direction. But these do the job for me because I have a pair of over ear headphones that I use when I'm on a long trip or have long-term use ahead of me. These earbuds are good while I'm mowing the grass or doing another short task."
1497,1,"I have used this speaker wire on two different home theater builds. It works well enough for smaller speakers and it's cheap, but it's not the best quality.Pros:---------------+ Cheap+ 100ft Rolls at a Great Price+ Works Fine for Smaller SpeakersCons:---------------- CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum) Wire, not as good as pure copper wire.- I ordered 16 Gauge but this wire is 18 Gauge, this is misleading and makes the value questionable.- I would not recommend this wire for large speakers."
1498,0,this one was garbage and dumps out after about 1 hour.Apparently rev. 2 or &#34;B&#34; has upgradeable firmware. But not this crapster.Onward! To Goodwill ye' shall be tossed!
1499,0,"I bought mine to control devices that are in a cabinet behind closed doors. Right now I have a TiVo and a Sony Blu-Ray player. The Sony will not work unless I'm standing 3' in front of the Terk unit. The TiVo works kind of. I have to aim it just right to get it to work. Unacceptable! I have the IR extender cable in use with the sensors on top of the devices on the back side of the cabinet door. I've moved them around about 20 times looking for the sweet spots, no luck. Can't blame the remotes either as I first had these results with the OEM remotes. Thinking they might be weak, I bought a Harmony One universal remote. No difference - same results. If I open the cabinet door, the remotes all work perfectly across the room from in the kitchen.If you're trying to control devices behind closed doors in a cabinet, skip this product."
1500,2,"Can be used as either a handheld unit or a permanent install.  Great value as it comes with a battery back for regular AA, a rechargeable battery pack for rechargeable AA's and the vehicle mounted cable for power and signal."
1501,2,"I wanted to know the inside dimensions of this bag so I could lay out my equipment and determine if it would all fit before buying.  I found the inside dimensions on several web sites, but all were wrong.  Even Canon exaggerates the inside dimensions. From those dimensions I was expecting more room than I got. I was expecting that my Canon 70-200 F4 lens could sit on end in a pocket, and it could, but only with the bag's inside cover pockets removed and with a bulge in the cover. I was also expecting my Canon 5DIII to sit face down with a shorter L zoom lens on it.  That was possible but was marginal and wasted space on either side of the lens. Nonetheless, the bag worked out well for me.My final design has my lens-less 5DIII on end in a pocket, two L zoom lenses on end in similar sized pockets, an L 100mm IS macro in another pocket, two non-zoom lenses stacked in another pocket, and a collection of stacked lens hoods with the detachable camera strap inside of them in yet another pocket (total of six roughly 3-4"" diameter pockets.  That leaves room for a 3.5x8"" pocket across one end that holds the 70-200 f4 on its side on the bottom, a piece of foam rubber over it, and a flash and lens mount on top.  I can put a flattened bean bag on top of all of this and get the cover zipped comfortably.  I do have to be careful that the four permanent snaps on the inside of the cover left exposed by the removed inside cover pockets do not rest on anything of value.  The bean bag helps with this.The actual INSIDE dimensions are 8"" wide, 6.5"" deep, and 13.5"" long. A box exactly this size (on the outside) would probably not fit fully inside the bag, but because the bag is a bit flexible and will conform to the contents, it will hold the equipment that would fit in those dimensions.There was no room left inside of the bag for my filters and the outside pockets would not accommodate my tamrack filter case, so the filters are wrapped in flannel and tucked into the bottom half of an old sock and then into a side pocket.  A 40mm pancake lens is also in a side pocket as are a charger and other accessories.  I'm going to make a map of the contents of the side pockets and keep it in the main compartment so I don't have to unzip and root through four outside pockets to find what I'm looking for.If you have Canon F2.8 lenses (24-70 and 70-200) your fit will be a bit tighter than mine.  The 24-70 should fit okay but the larger 70-200 will be tight in the end pocket.  The longer pocket may need to be along one side instead of across an end of the bag.  The 2.8 lens hood might also be problematic.  If you have one fewer lenses, you should be fine.The side pockets could be a bit larger and less rounded, but they are roomier than they look. The bag is excellent in all other respects.The shoulder strap is nicely padded though this is not a bag most of us would want to carry very far on a shoulder if it's well stocked. I will use it to store my equipment at home and transport it to the car and into a hotel and such. I generally only take the body and a lens or two in a holster or smaller sling bag when on a hike or other outing away from the hotel or car.If I'd been able to ascertain the exact internal size of this bag before buying, it would have been a five star purchase.  Instead it's a four star purchase. I don't know why product listings often don't contain critical information.EDIT:  I've uploaded some top view photos showing my gear arrangement.  This should help you decide what you can squeeze into this bag.  See the photo has has labels."
1502,0,"I upgraded my Linksys 802.11b (which always worked fine) to this ""g"" model for the improved speed.  I have been disappointed with its performance.  Initially, I noticed it was SLOWER than my old router.  After reading reviews on the internet (which I should have done before I bought it) I learned of many complaints about version 5.  I hurried to my office and flipped over the router and there it was, v.5 on the bottom.  Reading on, I learned about the firmware updates so I downloaded them which helped improve the speed a bit.  Now, the problem is streaming video.  With my old router, I used to be able to watch movie trailers and other streaming feeds.  This v.5 stutters and locks up the video.  If I can't resolve this problem I will likely find another router."
1503,0,"I bought this &#34;protector&#34; about a year ago about one month before I bought my $3,000 projector.  I thought about protection before I purchased my projector because it was very important I didn't lose what I spent my hard earned money.  The warranty claim of Belkin and great reviews were hard to pass up...and a hard lesson that words on a piece of paper do not mean much.&#34;The Story&#34;:One night I was watching TV on my projector when a storm rolled in and lightning struck near by.  The lights in the room went out then back on within a second.  The audio through my receiver was still playing along with the DVR, all of which was on a separate surge protector.  The projector, however, never came back on, it was dead, the surge protector was still on...both lights still going as if nothing happened.  In my home I have 3 TVs, 3 computers, 2 A/V receivers and several more expensive electrical components on multi-outlet surge protectors...*nothing* was touched except for the projector on this dedicated single-outlet surge protector.The claim to Belkin was sent in within the 15 days required, along with the surge protector (still working), the purchase receipt of both the protector and projector to show the sole purpose of the purchase was for just such an occasion.  Also sent to them was the professional repair diagnosis and repair estimate ($1,500 parts alone), the power supply was dead as well as the main circuit board.  This was also proof the damage occurred through the outlet and not some magical event.  Belkin ran their tests and simulated *minor* surges and found no issues and therefore were not liable.  They even sent back the exact protector so I could continue to use it...very thoughtful...Long story short, don't *ever* expect to make a claim with Belkin and receive compensation for a failure to protect your equipment.  There is no honor in this company and I will *never* buy Belkin again.  I have never had a failure before and I hope no one has to go through such an expensive trial and error as I have."
1504,0,"Installed OK, but speed was terrible with security enabled. Only marginally better with it disabled. I would recommend rather go with &quot;Netgear MA311 Wireless PCI Card&quot; for windows XP. The Linksys PCMCIA cards are great."
1505,2,"A solid performer, good resolution, no problem with most surfaces. Only three buttons (two regular - one push down the wheel). Have three of these on various computers - never had trouble - except with logitechs enhanced mouseware on NT (so I can't program the middle button there)."
1506,0,"This radio probably worked well in some situation, but performed lousy on mine. I listen to NPR in my morning walks, and need a good radio to listen to. So I bought this radio based on excellent reviews in Amazon. I used it with my iPod headphones. And I got so much statics that I had to basically gave up on it. I tried it for a week, and now know for sure. Even my little Sandisk Sensa radio's doing better than this big plastic thing. So I switched back to the Sensa.It may do a better job with other stations with stronger signal, but certainly not worth the $15 I spent. I didn't bother to send it back as it is cheap, but right now it does nothing for me."
1507,1,"I use this in my car on the passenger side visor but I had to put it on the &#34;top&#34; of the visor so that I have to flip the visor &#34;down&#34; to access the CDs.  I did this because when I put it on the bottom--so I didn't have to flip the visor down--the CDs would come shooting out of the sleeves of the CD case. Not the CDs inside (it is a double CD visor holder) but the ones on the outside were shooting out of the case at me whenever I made a turn!  I guess the CD slots are too roomy or maybe it is the fabric or something.  Once I put it on the top of the visor, the flying CDs stopped. It gets the job done."
1508,0,We had a cable from Radio Shack that went bad a few months after we purchased it. The serial application would not work with just any cable. We have had this one now for several months and it works great. It worked the first time we plugged it in. Not every USB to RS-232 Serial cable works with your equipment.
1509,1,"No drivers to be found to get this old sound card to work on a Windows 7 operating system.  They did a good job of getting rid of those drivers or keeping it out of reach. The drivers on the cd that it came with work on Windows 95 and Windows Vista, any operating system above that you're out of luck.  I love the audio chips that came in these sound cards and the drivers that helped to make it work 100%.  Creative Labs Sound Blaster, I know these cards are old but I sure wish you would keep it's drivers updated on your web page to get it to work on ALL up and coming operating systems."
1510,1,My wife really loves this keyboard and didn't have any problem adjusting to it.  However I have used a normal keyboard all my life including every day at work and I found this keyboard really frustrating and could never really get used to it.
1511,1,Brackets are good but the screws that attach the bracket to the speaker was not the right size. They were to fat and would not thread in. I had screws so i used mine. Other then that they work well.
1512,2,I have an old VCR that was getting quite dirty and this did the trick at cleaning the heads.  They are getting harder and harder to find but I'm glad I finally found this one to purchase.
1513,1,"The Canon NB-2L Battery Pack is just ok but it serves my needs.It is recommend that you buy a spare battery or even two spare batteries.Positives:* The NB-2L charges very fast. It charges fully in a little over an hour.* You can take a decent number of pictures without having to recharge the battery. I took about 95 at the 2048x1536 resolution in the fine mode on my Canon S30 in about 3 hours of shooting time and that was with the display on. If you turn the display off this time will be extended significantly.Negatives:* The charge does not last very long, usually less than a day. This is why that spare battery is mandatory.* The NB-2L battery is very limiting. It can only be used with Canon S30, S40, S45 and S50 Digital Cameras & Elura 40MC Camcorders. I could understand if it could be used with the whole line of Canon digital cameras but no, it can only be used with those models. The other Canon cameras have there own batteries such as the NB-1L. I don't know why this is. Maybe it's a money thing with Canon.* It's expensive. Though the price has gone down significantly from when it was first introduced a few years ago, it's still costly. Since you must buy a spare battery, it's hard on the wallet to buy one of these let alone two.Overall if you have any of the above model cameras you will need this battery even with all its flaws. The fact that this battery takes little or no time to charge is indeed the upside. So even if you can't afford a spare battery you will not have to wait forever to get it back up and running to take some more pictures."
1514,2,Locks up nicely to any stationary object. Keeps laptop secure from random hands picking it up and taking it. Long enough to secure it and still have freedom to move it around the desk.
1515,2,"The only reason i give this a 4 instead of a 5 star is that it could use some updates. ie. metal foot, weather sealing, to bring it up to current standards. This transmitter works great and does all that Canon says it will."
1516,2,"Works Great if you're not planning on getting sweaty, Sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the XtremeMac  class of Ear/Headsets on the market."
1517,2,"I have to say that for the price, this is a very good unit, and depending on how you intend to use it, this can be a great purchase.  For me, there were two separate dealbreakers which forced me to return this in favor of a Lumopro 160.  These may not be dealbreakers for you, though, but I wanted to mention them here since nothing in the descriptions here made these two issues apparent prior to ordering:1) the opening of the flash head is large, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, if you plan to use the largest size roguebender unit in a wrap-around-to-form-a-snoot mode, or to use the rogue grid set, this is a problem.  It is just too big for that.2) the sync port is a PROPRIETARY connector.  Dealbreaker for sure.  You can't use your normal connectors/cables from your existing radio trigger units.  The cables or adapters from pocket wizard are $25 each, which degrades the bargain status of this unit quite a bit.  Plus you have to carry and keep track of separate, special cables/connectors.For my specific purpose, mixing this in with studio lights as a small noot or grid spot, these were deal breakers.  If your use is more general, these are probably stlll a good deal: they will fill an umbrella nicely, and they work nicely enough on the hotshoe.  They feel sturdy.  The wide angle adapter is okay, but is a separate piece that slides in, not attached to the light, so it is another loose item to keep track of or lose.For my specific purpose, this simply is too much hassle, and won't play with the modifiers I want to use.  YMMV"
1518,2,"I've been using these headphones since 1996. I've owned many pairs but Koss has a no questions return policy, one time even sending me a new pair because I inquired about replacement ear pads. The sound that these cans put out are second to none. I flirted with Grado's and other expensive headphones but always run back to these. The look is very 80's retro because they are unchanged (by popular demand) since their introduction and they bring warm deep sound to anything you plug them into. Ear buds are for idiots. Step up to a pair of these babies and you'll be stoked at the sound they put out."
1519,0,"I tried unsuccessfully for a half day to uncurl four of these.  No luck.  Had to tape them down with gaffers tape to make them safe.  Don't even think about using them in colder, outdoor settings.  Fortunately I still have the Inland version of this product which is much easier to work with."
1520,0,"These are so popular I really thought they would be better.My first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly, the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears, which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about 45-60mins. I tried adjusting them every which way but It seems I needed to modify the pads.My second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about 3 months of very light use. I never put them too loud and never dropped them. They sat on my head or my desk always. Really sucks to have them die out so quickly.Sound quality wise these are OK. They definitely were detailed and quick accurate, but they definitely lacked the sound quality I expected. They also were very anemic in the bass department, it was almost non-existent.I now use the JVC HARX700 and enjoy them much much more. Very comfortable, better sounding, and cheaper."
1521,1,"I ordered 2 of the Driveway Patrol Sensor Receiver kits. 1 on 1/26/2013 and 1 on 2/2 2013. I liked the first one so I ordered a second one. I especially liked how loud the audio alarm was on them. In July the audio alarm stopped working on both of them. I have tried replacing all the batteries and putting the units next to each other and I can not get the audio to work on either one.The LEDs in both work fine, it just the audio that does not work.If I find a way to get the audio to work I will update my review. If the audio was still working I would give the units 5 stars."
1522,2,"I can't improve on what's already been said about these phones.  Sound as good as my Grado SR60 at about half the size and cost.  Seem to be very well constructed but I've only had them a few days.Stayed in place on my head through a sweaty 6-mile jog this morning.  First time I've had my tunes along on a jog and I highly recommend it.I run on a busy highway so I wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety.  I could hear the traffic and the music.  With no outside noise, the music is just incredible.  I use 320kbps mp3 mostly and, although I have a pretty good pc stereo setup (M-AUDIO, Kenwood, Bose), I heard not only new musical nuances but words which I had not previously recognized.I don't pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but I've been into music a long time.  We're into SACD, DVD-Audio with Klipsch and Polk speakers so I think I've heard some pretty good music.  I was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones.  Oh, I've tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a Sansa Clip player.  Both sound terrific.They don't look as hip as the little buds but they don't look totally dork either.  Cable is plenty long enough for me.  Now, I did hear a slight click with each jogging step which I think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself.  It may begin to bother me and if so I'll try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didn't detract from the music at all.I think most people will really like these phones.  I definitely do."
1523,2,"i bought these because of the isolation feature. i needed some earplugs because riding in a helicopter is just boring without music. I can ride in a blackhawk or chinook and listen to these at a comfortable volume, without hearing too much of the engine noise. a very minor thing is if you use these while running you will  hear yourself breathe a little louder than normal. its semi annoying, but im used to it now. would definately recommend for the price and quality."
1524,2,"I make sure to lock my Laptop up whenever i may be away from it for a long period of time. This lock is very sturdy and quick to enable/disable. Its portable, so I can take it with me on vacation to secure my laptop where ever I am."
1525,1,"I misinterpreted the features for this unit.  The specs for the AD-1500 said that it would only play PAL DVD's coded region 1.  When I read the specs for the AD-1600, I read &quot;region free&quot; to mean all regions.  In other (simpler) words.  I bought this unit to play DVD's sent me by my german relatives and discovered that the unit did not do so.  I have no idea where PAL DVD's with no region come from, but it isn't Germany.If you need to play DVD's from Europe, this is not the unit to do it.  I'm returning mine and having one imported from Germany.It does however, play NTSC DVD's, and all the other stuff specified at AOL quite well.Good luck.Peter"
1526,2,Works with my Canon Digital Rebel XT but the cable is really too short to be useful. Had to buy extension cable.
1527,0,"After reading all the great reviews and along with its price, I said ""Hey, why not?"".  Well, I shouldn't have.  The lens housing is flimsy (think Cracker Jack box).  I knew this going in, but even I was suprised to see HOW flimsy it was in person.  Everyone seems to rave about its sharpness and color quality.  It seems to compare to my lens kit, which is an 18-55mm Ultrasonic f/3.5-5.6 in terms of sharpness/color.  I also shot it against my Canon 50mm f/2.5 Compact-Macro (w/ aperture & shutter speed set the same, on a tripod for exact results).  The results were pretty well dead on.  I couldn't see a huge difference in the two.After shooting with this lens for a couple of hours, I decided to put it back in its box, and send it back.  I don't see what all the hype is about.  To top it off, it's a prime (non-zoom)lens.  I thought I could look past this to get those ""great shots"" everyones talking about.  After having to move back and forth shooting my products, I was almost to tired to package the box for the return...I wouldn't recommend getting this lens.  Save up and buy a better quality piece of glass.  Hope this helps some of you sitting on the fence."
1528,1,"The sound is good, bassy, but the trouble we had was with the cord/wiring. It didn't retract easily... which is why we bought these for our teenagers. So they wouldn't have dangling cords when they are running or working out.  They didn't last long and were eventually replaced with something else."
1529,0,"I loaded the software (musicmatch) and it's difficult to navigate through. Took me 2 hours to initially load the music as you need to copy the cd tracks to a folder then to the mp3 player. I tried to use it on my laptop which has an upgrade and it can't find the player, so now I can't load anything to the player. I tried to contact RCA but there is no support for the basic software package. You need musicmatch to interface with the player and if it can't find it, then it's money down the drain. Get an Ipod, it's alot easier as my friend demonstrated and face it, spending 5 hours to get this thing to work plus the aggravation is worth the ease of an ipod, just plug and load.I wish RCA wouldn't use me as a beta tester and then not provide support unless I pay 19.99 for it. The radio presets are also a pain to use. Mine's going in the trash."
1530,2,"Overall a really good flash for beginners and experienced photographers alike. If you're used to an automatic flash this may not be the best option for you, as everything is controlled by the user. However, if you would like to learn more about flash photography (especially off-camera lighting), you can't beat the value of this unit."
1531,2,"Pros- Great Sound!!, Portable, Incredibly Comfortable, they just look coolCons- Not so durable, cord feels cheapI saw these on CNET as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost 100's of dollars and thought I'd give them a try.  I am not disappointed, they look great and sound even better.  They fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket.  They even come with a nice leather carrying pouch."
1532,0,I bought one of these when I bought my Canon s70 less than two months ago. The card has rolled over and died on me. I went to the retailer and they said that the defect is a manufacturer issue. We went to the packaging for warranty details and there is NO warranty listed on the packaging other that it is warranted to work (fit) in compactflash cameras. The brand of card next to it on the shelf (Kodak) had a 5 year warranty for functionality.Nextime is Kodak for me
1533,2,"Bought this to mount a eTrex HCx to my dirt bike. At first I freaked out because it included a new back cover that fits into the handle bar clamp. That cover does not fit the HCx. But then I realized my eTrex HCx came with the snap on piece that that fits into the handle bar clamp. The rubber spacers work great keeping the unit tight on the handle bars. However the GPS rattled a little bit once in was snapped into the handle bar clamp. I put some black tape inside to take up the space and it's all good now. I just figure with all the bumps that come with trail riding, I did not want the unit to rattle around. Overall looks like a sturdy product. Glad to have my GPS mounted now, so I dont have to keep pulling it from my bag."
1534,2,"If you have more then one extra lens, don't get this bag. It only fits the camera with attached lens, and one extra lens which is nice if you only have one. But if you need to take a couple lenses with you, I'd suggest something bigger like this backpack:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6TA/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i02"
1535,2,"I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these."
1536,1,"First of all, this tripod has the feel and look of a cheaply made, imported item - that's why I give it 3 stars.  I realize you get what you pay for - but hey, it's still cheap product.The legs do not extend - but they seem sturdy and firmly stay in place when unfolded.  There is one tightening screw that controls the amount of pivoting and adjustment you can make.  The tripod takes up a relatively small amount of space when folded up - roughly 1 3/4"" at is widest point by 4 1/2"".Warning! Don't be foolish and attach anything bigger than a compact camera, or a camera that was designed for travel (I experimented).  The reason is the tripod's footprint is too small - if you put a camera w/ a detachable lens or a camcorder atop this pipsqueak the center of gravity will be too high and it will tip over easily - there goes your big $$ investment, all because of a $7 tripod."
1537,2,While you're shopping just remember this fact:KOSS PORTAPRO--ROCKIN OUT NONSTOP SINCE 1984 BECAUSE OF OVERWHELMING CUSTOMER DEMAND.There's one solid fact about the performance of portable headphones and that's it.  Go with the proof.
1538,0,"Horrible product.  I &quot;upgraded&quot; from my Netgear RP114 to this product so I could ditch my software firewall. Well, I wish I hadn't.  I get constant lockups and dropped connections on both WAN and LAN.  Noticeably slower web access compared to the RP114 it replaced (Although I'll chalk this up to a true SPI firewall).  Finally, after years of good tech. support from Netgear, I had the added bonus of talking with a tech. who didn't have the slightest clue about the specs of this router. She spent nearly half an hour insisting that my router had a &quot;check&quot; light, indicated by a check mark shaped LED.  I kept arguing that my router had no such light (although another popular Netgear router does).  Furthermore, her official answer to everything was &quot;just reboot&quot;.  I felt like I was stuck in a real-life episode of Dilbert.  Anyway, numerous updates, countless resets (full and partial), and a mountain of frustration later, I'm ditching this paperweight and going in another direction.  Save yourself the time, money, and aggravation and avoid this puppy at all costs."
1539,2,Fit's the Canon T2i no problem. Pouch under the lid will hold memory cards and the small extras. Outside pouch is very roomy. Strap is a little stiff but I think it will work in over time. The low price makes this an excellent buy.
1540,2,"UPDATE: the plastic broke while travelling, so they no longer stay on my head.  Consider a product like Koss' ""The Plug"" instead.I bought a pair of these about 18 months ago and use them regularly on airplanes. They are a substantial improvement over the usual cheap headphones provided by the airline, because of the noise reduction, the ""around the ear"" instead of ""on the ear"" construction which itself seals against outside noise, and the sound quality.The sound quality is quite acceptable for airplane listening. They don't stand up to good quality headphones that don't have NC and don't fold up, but their convenience makes up for it.They don't sound as good as the Bose headphones that are sometimes handed out on business class, but they are substantially cheaper.Two minor downsides. First, they can get uncomfortable after a few hours of listening. Second, there is a little plastic cover for the battery which recently came off and got lost, and now the battery sometimes falls out and gets lost.Overall they are a substantial improvement over what the airplane gives you. You can actually understand the spoken parts of a movie. They are compact, light, and easy to carry around so they are always in my carryon bag, and I use them a lot.I wouldn't be surprised if some of the newer units in the same or slightly higher price range would be better, as this is an older unit."
1541,0,Great facade within lousy performance! Skips from disk 1. Sony can do better. Do Not buy this product - waste of money!!!
1542,0,"I spend far too much time on-line.  That, coupled with my love of knitting, had me looking for a telephone headset.  I had hoped, based on the reviews, that this was that headset.

1544,0,"I've owned this radio for less than a year and in that year I have replaced the batteries twice,now the radio won't play unless I jump start it plugged in, after that it will work several hours unplugged but whenever I turn it off I again have to jump start it.While removing the battery one of the two fragile screws snapped off.Another problem is terrible reception,mostly static.I called Tivoli and was told they will repair it for $50.00.So you can make up your own mind whether this expensive radio is really worth it or not.I registered it immediately after I recieved it and Tivoli will not fix it without a receipt, Does anyone keep a receipt that long?Total cost $200 for the radio, over $50.00 for batteries, and now another $50.00 for repairs plus the shipping charges.I have only taken it out of my house one time and the rest of the time it stays on my desk plugged in.I personally will never buy another Tivoli product."
1545,0,I tried to use this on my laptop with a ps/2 keyboard.  It worked for about 50 char and would just stop working.  I tried to unplug it and replug it.. again.. about 50 or so char.  I gave up and bought a usb keyboard.. that works great.

1547,2,"The device came quickly, and works as advertised. Limited to about 15 feet. Works on 5D2 and 500D. Drawback: receiving sensor is on front only! Plus: Cheap!"
1548,2,"I had mine sent back and i think it was 14 dollars (like a year ago) + shipping.  And I felt like I got a brand new one back in the mail.  They even replaced the cushions.The sound quality of this headphone is very VERY good.  Lets just say that it has its own style.I can say for sure, that...  Highs are clear, and the base is on the heavy side, and it has just enough surround sound.  But the sound quality of these headphones are so unique that you just have to try them out for yourself.If you are an audiophile, you got to have one of these just because it's worth having it."

1550,0,"This was my second purchase of this headset.  I recently moved, and my old headset was packed away somewhere.  The first one I bought worked great, considering the price, although it did occasionally have static when the connection point with the phone was moved.  But the new one is static-y unless I keep the phone and cord perfectly motionless.  I'm grateful I finally found my original, and didn't drop a lot of cash on this one. My next headset will be a higher quality model."
1551,2,"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.  Since I have owned numerous (Including this one) Sony products over the years I don't think I am outside my realm.I always have a need for music either reviewing, archiving, or pleasure.  The Sony CFD-ZW755 grants the consumer many features without bloating the price tag.While it is not going to take the place of the high end system in your music room with its versatility it will be a welcome companion in an office, a guest room, or in proximity of the kitchen.  Batteries or electricity the option is yours.The AM/FM tuner locks in the stations well without the drifts often associated with lesser models.  There are settings to taylor the sound to your liking (Rock, Pop, Vocals).The dual tape enables recording from tape to tape, CD to tape, or radio to tape.  The CD portion of the unit is reliable when handled properly.If you don't want to spend endless time researching a good unit, Sony is a name you can trust.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"""
1552,0,"The Sennheiser PX 100 headphones are nice.  I could write a stellar review of their many audio attributes.Unfortunately, the weak audio jack connector coupled with Sennheiser's Anti-Maker manufacturing process leave me wanting more.  The headphone jack dies after about a year.  There are two wire bundles that run to the stock headphone jack.  Each wire bundle has one channel of audio, plus one ground line.  The two wires are separated by an almost imperceptible amount of rubber.  This is what causes the headphones to eventually die.  The rubber cracks, and then the audio line touches the ground line, and goodbye sound.Sennheiser's decision to run the ground wire &lt;0.5mm away from the audio line for each channel is a poor move.  The audio channel lines on each side of the cable have nylon braid inside, which no amount of flux can overcome.  It repels solder, making repair impossible.  Once the connector dies (and it will die), you have a $100 piece of plastic that cannot be repaired.Save your money and buy a cheaper pair of headphones.  Repair will probably be easier on a non-Sennheiser headphone set...and if not, at least you didn't spend $100 on them."
1553,2,"Have a night shot without a flash problem and can't hand hold the camera, tripod it and use this cable release...this is just the electronic version of that...A must have for night shots. This is a Canon product and is designed to work with all modern Canon camera's. I own a T3i and it works just fine. Great asset to have for night shots where the lens has to stay open for long periods and cannot be jostled."
1554,0,"I was using this for around 2 years for regular browsing, email, chat etc. Recently I started using this to hook up my media player which can play streaming videos from netflix. and it started giving me trouble. The playback frequently stops and slowsdown. The internet connection speed gets slower and slower with videos causing youtube and netflix to not work properly. It takes 5 minutes sometimes to start the video on youtube. None of these issues are there if I connect the computer/player directly to the cable modem. I have tried changing the network cables, switching between wired and wireless connections, etc etc, but none of them helps. As soon as there is this router in the middle the playback is horrible. The only good thing I see with this is good wireless signal strength. If you are using this for just chat and email this is probably an okay router with pretty good signal strength."
1555,2,"This camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures!  They are very sharp and the color is great.  It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras I owned.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the LCD screen is kind of useless in bright light, and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture, but I heard that happens with some other cameras too.  Still, I am very, very pleased with this camera."
1556,1,"I got this player in Nov 2002 mostly to test and play VCD and SVCDs. I was pleasantly surprise that it was nicely build, and easy to use. It played SVCDs, mp3, jpegs (!), DVDs, but whenI tried to play a VCD, 'NO DISC'. After some research on the internet, I found out that Apex has dropped VCD as a supported format due to licensing issues. The only chance to get an Apex VCD capable player is to get an &quot;old stock&quot; version.So, I had to return it. What is Apex thinking?I'd buy 2 if it did VCDs, but now I went and bought a phillips580HT (vertical DVD at Target), which does it all. (for 2 times the price:( )For what it does do, 5 stars, for dropping VCD support,a no-buy and knock it down a few stars."
1557,0,"Recently our home was hit with a powerful electrical surge -- whether it was from lightning or from a transient power surge we can't say for certain (we suspect lightning).  Three out of four Belkin surge suppressors were 'fried' and failed to protect the attached devices, including a new 32"" Samsung LCD TV and a Canon fax machine.  The surge cube suppressor I am reviewing here actually melted (the plastic bubbled from heat). Other units evidenced actual brown (burnt) singe marks. Based on this experience we are switching back to TrippLite Isobar.  As for Belkin's $25,000 warranty, go on-line and check out what you must do and the costs you must expend to seek reimbursement for damage. Plan on spending lots of time and money at the Post Office or UPS.Whatever suppressor you choose, opt for the most Joules protection and fastest clamping speed you can afford. If your device is worth protecting, spending a bit more on the surge suppressor is cheap insurance."
1558,0,"I bought this MP3 player thinking that it would be convenient and also double as a hard disk to move files from home to work and vise versa.  Since I have had the machine I have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times (within 2 months).  Currently it is not working at all.  This machine has been extremely unreliable.  Often I would go on a trip and it would simple not work- one then needs the CD and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again.  and , after you reformat it, you have to re-install all the songs you had on there before.  When it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were.  I thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use.  Nothing is further from the truth.  I am only upset  now because I cannot find the receipt to return this junk.  Please, do yourself a favor and get something else."
1559,2,"Well, i bought this free a few weeks ago with rebate.  What else can you say about a free optical mouse?  But just ignore the rebate, I own this optical mouse and another one: Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical.  They are comparable in price, but this logitech one is clearly the better choice.  More responsive, comfortable, accurate, better feel, better look, .......  Logitech products haven't disappointed me so far.  I guess no matter what Bill does, Microsoft can't stiffle competition here.  Microsoft is just not that great on hard ware.I gave only 4 stars because this mouse is not perfect, of course.  More $ can buy you a better mouse.  But this is a great value for the money (even without rebate)."
1560,2,These are great sounding headphones ! They are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price.
1561,0,"I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 that is now 7 years old and has logged hundreds of thousands of miles, so I take care of my stuff. This Chill Pad [ASIN:B0000AKA8Y Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad] was purchased for my notebook. It did cool pretty well. Laptop speed, performance and battery life improved while using the Chill Pad. After just 5 months of use I have just thrown the Chill Pad in the garbage. Just three weeks after I bought it the plastic feet began to fall off. No problem I thought and purchased new plastic nubs to repalce those that had fallen off. Whatever paint is on the unit, the plastic bumps will NOT stick to even after using the original adhesive backing, (which has stuck to my Dell for years) contact cement, and super glue. No plastic bumps on the bottom -- big discomfort on my legs. Today, I noticed that my laptop was hot. I checked the Chill Pad and the fans were not running. Initial troubleshooting pointed to the USB plug not making proper contact, so power to the unit was intermittent. Replaced the USB plug. Chill Pad ran for about 30 seconds. Further troubleshooting revealed a broken wire at the flexy joint on the mini-plug that plugs into the Chill Pad. The wire is so thin that I had a heck of a time trying to fix it (VERY CHEAP)and finally disassembled the unit and wired direct to the fans. Testing my work, only one fan was running. I surmised that even though I soldered all connections, shrink wrapped everything AND used a grommet at the edge of the Chill Pad case, the Targus wire was so thin that something probably pulled loose during reassembly. Rather than waste any more bench time on a unit which had 32 gauge wire in it I threw the whole Chill Pad in the garbage. By the way, my Inspiron, with a 16:9 LCD screen overlapped both sides of the Chill Pad by almost an inch. If you are looking for quality, and a large enough cooling solution for a 17"" laptop, look elsewhere than this particular Targus unit."
1562,0,".My cable modem supports speeds of up to 15Mbps--typically about 12Mbps download, and up to 2Mbps upload--typically 1.8Mbps. I have a Gigabit switch on the other side for my home LAN.I picked one of these up because of the Linksys warranty.  I never got to use that warranty because my first one failed within two weeks of heavy use, and the second one (a replacement) began to fail in a week.  I was able to return both devices to Staples for an exchange and then a full refund.To be fair, I push a massive crazy amount of data through each of these two units.  I don't know whether the parts began to overheat and fail, but I found myself reseting the device once a day, and a few days later it was  not working when I got up in the morning, wasting much of my time.  And finally I needed to reset it three to five times in the span of an hour or two--I pulled them off-line when it got this bad.As these were new units, I did not update the firmware.  My feeling is these have been out a long time, and the firmware should have been up to date without my fussing with it.These units might be ok if you don't need to download or upload a lot of data.  If you are a power user, they just don't cut it.  On the other hand, why should you have to reset it?  A good router never fails.Also, I noticed my download speeds were poor.  My hunch is there is a bandwidth limit to the device that is far below that of cable modem speeds.So the bottom line is this.  It is a cheap unit, required reseting frequently, and probably--almost certainly has limited bandwidth.  So it is clear, this is one to avoid.A final hint, if a router had several gigabit LAN ports it will have higher bandwidth."
1563,1,"This cassette adaptor couldn't be easier to use for playing music through car or stereo speakers.  Cut the adaptor out of its plastic packing, stick it into a cassette deck, plug it into the headphone jack of your portable music player, and, voil&agrave;, music.  It's really as simple as that.  The adaptor requires no assembly or adjustments to work perfectly right out of the box.This device works only with cassette decks that load with the tape to one side (not front loading), as the cable that connects to your portable device comes out of a short side, so check your cassette deck before purchasing this.  The best part is that it works silently, allowing your music to sound as clear as it should.  You can adjust the sound through your stereo or through the portable device itself.I've used this both with a regular iPod and an iPod mini with great success.  It's much better (and cheaper) than buying one of the FM stereo broadcasting devices because it's never dependent upon available airwaves and never needs re-tuning as you move from one radio zone to another.Highly recommended if you plan on listening to digital music in the car.  As long as your car has the correct kind of cassette deck and your portable device has a standard headphone jack, it will work without a hitch.Update to review, several months later:  This adaptor started making a clicking sound, and occasionally makes a terrifying electronic buzz that nearly scares me into accidents.  It did spend the winter in the car, although my garage never gets below freezing.  Unfortunately, I can't tell if this noise problem is because of my old car stereo or because of some electronic defect in the adaptor that cropped up after heavy use.UPDATE:  When I first wrote this review, reviewers were not allowed to edit the number of stars, so this remained a five-star review until today.  Although I no longer use this product, it worked great for several months (five stars), but then developed the noise noted above (1 star).  I gave it an average of three stars."
1564,0,"I Bought a wireless Netgear Mr814 almost a year ago. After a couple of weeks of usage the wireless connection started to break up. Assuming i had interference from my unshielded TV cables, I hardwired ethernet connections to the router and everything worked fine. A couple of weeks ago I started to get download error messages, then I started having trouble with sending and receiving E-mails (same problem two different computers).I sent six E-mails to Netgear, and called twice. They had me update the firmware, and change the MTU size to 1500, 1400, and finally 1000. Nothing helped, in frustration I bought another Netgear Ethernet router (RP614) - I am still using the same settings as with the original router - and I got perfect communications.I tried to get an RMA from Netgear under the three year warranty. Even though the replacement RP614 from the same company works fine, I was told that they could not give an RMA and that I would have to call their premium service at a cost of $29 to have them diagnose the MR814 over the phone (note that I have already been in touch with customer support for two weeks). If premium service is unable to fix the problem they would then give me a RMA. It seems to me that the $29 probably covers the cost of the replacement router. They have lost a customer."

1566,0,I normally have had good luck with Linksys products as I do a lot of home/small office networking setups as a sideline business.  However a client of mine went out and purchased the WRT54G ver 6 router without consulting me first.  What a nightmare.  Linksys has really cheapened the WRT54G and WRT54GS routers with less flash memory and less RAM and a new embedded operating system.Router acted flaky right out of the box.  Went into the web interface and discovered that the interface was in German.  Flashed the firmware to the latest revision thinking that would fix the language issue.  It did not.  Do a Google and you will see this is a known problem with the this version.So off to Big Box Mart to exchange the router with an identical one.  At least the replacement worked.  Web interface was in English as expected.  Using IE7 and discovered an issue with the web interface though.  Was not able to set up MAC address filtering as the interface would not refresh correctly.  Used another laptop with IE6 and was able to set up MAC address filtering.My advice:  Avoid the new WRT54G and WRT54GS routers like the plague.  Do yourself a favor and order the WRT54GL which has more flash and RAM memory and a stable embedded Linux for an operating system.
1567,2,"This is a great little ""on the go"" camera bag for my Pentax K100D. The bag is a little oversized but I figured a general bag for all cameras would not result in a snug fit. The sides are pretty thick and shock absorbant. That was my biggest concern was that the bag could take a few minor bumps and not damage the camera. It has a few nice little pockets for the extras and a decent sized outside pocket (although not big enough for a lens-could hold a cell phone, small wallet, car keys, etc.). I can hardly wait for winter to end so I can take my camera on a hike and get some good pics."
1568,2,"I've compared these ear buds to Shure e2c's, ($50-60), and Creative Zen Auravana's, ($60-100), and found them better than the Shure's and almost as good as the Auravana's in certain ways, and better in other ways, (the bass on the Auravana's is too thumping, and cable noise is worse than the Koss).  They're just plain astounding - especially for the money.  If you want to buy something that beats all three, get the Creative EP-830's.  Incredible sound that just barely beats these little Koss buds - but they're $50.  For the money, the Koss can't be beat, period."
1569,2,"I shopped around for digital cameras for a month before deciding on the Fuji 1300. Its low price makes it a fantastic first digital camera, and photo quality is excellent.I bought the camera a few days before heading off to France on vacation, and was up to speed on the camera's features within the first day.Installing the program onto your computer is a bit of a beeyach, but only took me a few minutes. I've never had any problems since installation.My biggest recommendation? Get two sets of rechargable AA batteries--like most digitals, the 1300 eats batteries."
1570,1,"Everything you've probably heard about Sennheiser sound quality is very much present in these HD202s, which reproduces music faithfully, in high quality, and with a boatload of bass.  I imagine this is about as good as it gets for headphones that retail for under $40, and I can say with absolute certainty that these sound a lot cleaner and more satisfying than the equivalent Sony.Unfortunately, the oppressive tightness of the headband ruins it for me -- these squeeze my head to the point that I end up thinking about the discomfort as much as the music.  Dealbreaker.  A shame, since this model seems so ergonomically sound otherwise, with quality padding for the ears and under the headband, and a superlong 3-meter cord."
1571,2,"The Koss PortaPro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic.  I read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so I gave them a try.  Wow, the sound that comes from these headphones are great(no static/noise).  The fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size.  I thought the metal would bother me( I shave my head) but no problem here I do not feel them.  If you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further."
1572,0,"I bought this card with the hopes of an easy installation on my W2K notebook.  Getting it to work with a non-Linksys wireless hub took several frustrating evenings.  The documention that came with the device and on the Linksys web site was absolutely useless.  The installation software had conflicts with the firewall software so I had to remove both the firewall and linksys software and reinstall the software. Getting the 128 bit WEP configuration to work required asking a consultant for help.  Apparently, you must enter the long security code versus the network access password.  This obscure nuance was not obviously noted in the manual or on line documentation.  I'm sure it is a little more straight forward if your network is all one brand but getting this device to work in a mixed brand environment was difficult and I should have listened to the consultant and bought the NetGear card."

1574,1,They sound okay too I suppose. They're rather flimsy though and it doesn't seem like much thought nor effort went into the quality and design of these which surprised me since they're SONY branded. I won't buy these again. Shipping and delivery was what would normally be expected of Amazon -- prompt.
1575,2,"I've tried to give Koss praise for these all over the internet where ever I can.These headphone just do not get enough credit.They are small, hold well on your head and sound FANTASTIC.Granted if you want full on studio get big $200 to $400 dollar over the ear headphones, but for a reasonable second place when you are jogging at the gym, these are the ticket.I've bought about 3 or 4 pairs and plan to buy these for the rest of my life unless I hear something better.That hasn't happened in a decade so far....The BEST.  Try them out!"

1577,2,"Bought it for use with my Vista HCx. One needs to screw on a bicycle mount adapter to the back cover of the original HCx back. That mount adapter is one of the accessories that comes together free with the Vista HCx. It is needed to fit the Vista HCx onto this bicycle mount.For now, the plastic cover is useless as its only for non 'x' versions of the etrex series. But anyway looking at it, the Vista HCx battery cover is much better with the rubberised insulation. The HCx bicycle mount adapter itself is also better as it has a larger lever than the one in the cover supplied in this product.As for the bicycle mount, it fits perfectly with my mountain bike. Those with larger tube diameters can by the Large rail mount adapter:Garmin Large Diameter Rail Mount Adapter (010-10496-00)For users who have an Etrex/Vista/Legend 'x' versions(with microsd expansion) i suggest buying this instead:Garmin Rail Mount Adapter (010-10496-01). The search for ""Garmin Bicycle Mount"" didnt turn this up because its a ""RAIL MOUNT"" which is half the price of what i bought here. One will still need the plastic bicycle mount adapter accessory that came with the GPS device."
1578,1,"This is not pure copper...it is copper clad aluminum (CCA). Cost is less, but that's because aluminum is cheaper and more resistive than copper.Suppliers like Monostat and others have quality 100% copper speaker wire for about 2x the expense of this.  It really is a much better deal unless you are connecting 200 dollar speakers.  If you spent 1000's on your speaker setup...dont skimp now.You dont need monster cables or anything like that...but pure 100% copper wire makes a huge differance."
1579,0,"I like the sound fine, but the headphones have a couple of ways of breaking: where the over-the-head plastic joins the u-shaped yoke attached to the earpiece, and where the earpiece mount pivots in the over-the-head plastic. They're just too cheaply and flimsily made. Nothing like seeing $150 bite the dust just because of some broken thin plastic parts. :("

1582,2,"I'm hiding three medium thickness cords from my ceiling mounted projector in these, and they really do the job well.  It is a tight fit with three cords -- I have to ensure that they are all perfectly aligned down the length of the mold, but it's not too hard to do.  I haven't bothered to paint them to match my wall yet, but I like that the possibility is there.  As far as the glue that other reviewers have mentioned: it does seem very strong, but in fact it fell about a week after installation.  I *think* this was due to an unusually high amount of humidity making the initial adhesion weaker than it could've been.  Whatever it was, I simply reattached the molding to the ceiling/walls and they've held firmly since then.  Just as an FYI, I found these same kits in my local hardware store for the same price as I paid here (~$20), so don't feel like you have to wait on delivery if you're looking to save on the purchase."
1583,1,".As a PDA, the Toshiba e740 is the best I've seen yet.  However, it, like all PDAs based on Microsoft's Windows CE, falls short on networking.I've been hoping that Microsoft and its partners would get networking right some day.  The Toshiba e740 looked like it might be the answer.  With its built-in WiFi wireless network adapter, it appeared that the e740 at least would provide useful local area network connectivity.  However, like most WiFi devices, the e740's range is too short and the battery drain is too high.Oh, well, how about wide area networking with a wireless modem?  I was able to find one wireless modem that would plug into the e740's compact flash slot.  This modem, its name escapes me, adds 5 inches to the e740's almost 5 inches and costs an arm and two legs in monthly fees.  With the modem in place, the e740 takes on the form factor of a clamshell handheld Windows CE PC.  Forget that.  I'm trying to replace a Blackberry wireless e-mail device.I'm now looking at Handspring's Treo 300.  It's got everything that the Blackberry delivers including size plus it's a wireless phone, has a color screen and supports web browsing.  Wireless networking is part of your phone service and the cost for wireless phone and networking (from Sprint) is about the same as I'm now paying for separate wireless phone and Blackberry wireless e-mail.For the record, I'm an IT consultant and author specializing in electronic communications.

Please do not compare this product to Sony or Bose. Bose and Sony are much better, but the price is also six times this one.Over all, I would suggest you not to buy this item.

1590,0,"This is one headphone that gets great reviews, I got them but was underwhelmed.I don't regret purchasing them for the sale price.. around 10 bucks.But, more than that I don't really think it's a great value.... $10 should be the regular price.I'd rate it 3-stars if the volume control casing were conic instead of squared, and if it were foldable and folded flat and still $10.Foldable being.. like the Sennheiser PX100.Folding flat being... like the JVC Flat line of similar headphones.There's nothing spectacular about them.Sound quality is sufficient, but it's not impressive.  Actually, after listening to these for hours and putting on the HA-S160 by JVC.The JVC HA-160 is significantly clearer.  Listening to these, the KTXPRO1 is muddy/muffled, as if the sound is coming through a blanket.... or closed window.Not any better Sony, JVC, or Panasonic headphones around the same price (or cheaper if these are being sold anywhere near MSRP)Build quality.. it's all plastic with this silicone band stretchy thing at top which, i don't know what it does.Build quality feels a bit cheap.They don't fold up to a more compact space saving form or fold up flat... for travel and stuff..The most impressive thing about these was the packaging.  It's a big pretty box instead of a small blister pack.The volume control thing on the cord is completely idiotic... Who designed this thing?  All it does is get smashed and caught in everything and get in the way... you can't re-position it or detach it.  and it's this boxy thing instead of being curved up top (conic) and bottom so it gets caught in stuff... like under a table, then you move your head up and chaos ensues.Lean forward against the table and the slider slides itself down.So... decent buy, but not impressed, didn't live up to expectations after reading reviews."
1591,2,"use it all the time on the subway.  it's been used for over 2 years.  just becareful of rolling up the cord.  after a while it could lose some of it's connectivity at the head socket if your'e too rough with it, but luckily it has a lifetime warranty."
1592,0,The thing is cheaper at the circuit city website. That's all I have to say about it.
1593,1,"I originally got this for my Mercedes and the quality was somewhat OK. Since then I upgraded my audio system to full aftermarket. I tested it out on my wife's Toyota and the quality was horrible, read unlistenable. If this is the best one out there, I think there is something to ask of it."
1594,2,"i've had this camera pack for a while now and i just can't live without it. after reading tons of reviews and researching other sites and stores, i decided this would fit my needs best.it's small, light weight and carries EVERYTHING inside it without drawing attention to itself. i can carry my canon 20d with all my accessories plus a few personal extras all day without back pain or tiring out. trust me, when it's Mardi Gras in the Big Easy, that means a lot!I CARRY THE FOLLOWING IN MY PACK:(while i was able to fit everything listed below inside, mind you, it's tightly packed)**Canon 20D with 100mm lens attached (without hood) and strap**18-55 Kit Lens**Promaster External Flash Unit with 2 Stofen Omni Bounce diffusers**backup camera battery with charger**3 4/packs of AA batteries (for flash unit)**all my owner's manuals plus a medium sized handbook (i'm a beginner)**lens cloth and small airblower bottle for lens cleaning**cords for hooking camera to TV and PC**2 backup memory cards (the red flap is extremely handy to keep track of used cards)**small notebook & pen, few personal items such as chapstick, headband etc...**cell phone (hooked on the outside)**water bottle (hooked on the outside)**sunglasses (in outer pocket -meant for the tripod)PLUS:1. size - perfect for a medium sized female2. construction - extremely well made, sturdy fabric, lots of padding and does a great job at keep humidity out (big deal down here)3. organized - with it's repositionable/removable compartment dividers, packing what you need is a breeze...plus there are lots of hooks & such on the outside for additional options...and you can add a tripod if you choose.4. color makes it look like any normal back pack.5. price was great for what i got.MINUS:(very minor, but these are my reasons for giving 4 opposed to 5 stars)1. rain flap over zippers make opening and closing somewhat combersome, but you get used to it. besides it's like an extra layer of protection (both from rain and thieving hands).2. if you want to fit an external flash along with extra lenses, you may consider a larger bag.3. it doesn't really do a great job at carrying my tripod. it becomes too difficult to get my camera in and out of the pack with a tripod attached (you have to remove the tripod before you are able to open the bag, not the most convenient while walking around)."
1595,0,"About 6 months after I started using my SanDisk card in my Canon camera, I started to get ""memory error"" problems.  I reformatted the card in the camera and that got things working for a few more months.  Now, reformatting using the camera doesn't work.I called SanDisk customer support and they told me I need to reformat using a card reader.  Then they told me I am supposed to reformat the card twice a month using a card readder.  When I told them I don't have one, they told me to go buy one, or go visit a local Staples or Office Depot and try to use theirs!  Are these guys kidding???  Reformat twice a month?  Walk into a store and ask the sales guy if I can borrow the use of a card reader????  No way!When I insisted that SanDisk replace the card, they reluctantly agreed to do so, and even then, they said they would only replace the card this once since I failed to follow the ""standard procedure"" of using a card reader to reformat the card.  All this over a $25 card.  It would have be so much easier for them to simply offer to replace the card at the outset without all the attitude.  I'm never buying SanDisk again."
1596,2,My daughter used this at school for her computer and it works so well best money I've spent on college
1597,1,"I am a medium to high end user of photographic equipment. I purchased this lens for the ""speed"" of the lens and its ability to function in low light. The lens does work well in low light but I have not been overly pleased with the focus of the images. The lens is a little heavy as well. I like using this as my walk-around lens when taking street scenes. The focusing may be user error but I have read some reviews regarding the re-calibrating of this model by the manufacturer."
1598,0,"They should informed you that digital signal cannot be converted to analog , because of that I wasted my money more details should have been given such as you would also need an adaptor"
1599,1,price isn't bad..didn't like the color because i use this at nightand the white color sticks out like a sore thumb...i ended up putting black tape allover it for concealment..works most of the time.. but fast moving vehicles will sometimesget by it without triggering the alarm
1600,0,I ordered two of these headsets and have been very happy with the fit and sound quality. However I found that others using the headset for the first time may break the unit where the adjustable sliding band meets the ear/microphone section.I ended up taping the break on both sets and they work well.When kids visit I now disconnect the headset.Update 8/12Both headbands snapped. Duct tape works temporarily.  Ordered a different headset.
1601,0,Several  lenses have specks of debris on the inside of the eyepiece. I don't feel comfortable disassembling the eyepiece to clean then however.
1602,2,"Does exactly what it should. I use it with a Blue Tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds. No noise on changing volume levels, long lasting (wear at night, so subject to toss and turn). The variable resistor must be of some quality in that it hasn't started making noise yet. (most cheap volume controls (potentiometers), start making noise after a short while)."
1603,2,"Good.  Nice trackball, with good wireless range.  Far far better than a Kensington one which I used before this.  Accurate, and easy to use.  Highly recommended.  BTW, I use this with a HTPC connected to a LCD TV, so that there aren't cables aplenty running across the living room.  It serves this purpose very well, together with a wireless keyboard of course!"
1604,2,This is an excillent head cleaner. There are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process & you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get 100 uses out of it. Then just toss it out & replace it. This cleaner really improves the A/V quality on a VCR.
1605,1,It works but noise. You can hear the mechanic noise(not the audio noise) from the device. the sound quality is OK.
1606,2,"I had a pair of these (Best Buy edition with cloth-covered cable & updated styling, not anniversary) years ago. Those were misplaced, but I remembered them fondly. I switched to Bluetooth behind-the-neck models for awhile (Motorola over-ear) and those were great, but I forgot how much sound-quality was sacrificed by the switch. Had to buy new ones after my Motorolas were stolen, so I came back to the cord, a little reluctantly since I use them actively.Glad I went back. The clarity is fantastic. Comfort-wise, I do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time I put them on (and that's somewhat annoying) but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that. The cord is on the shorter end at four feet, which I appreciate- I've never seen the need for long cords on headphones. If I need to use them at a desktop or something I'll grab an extender. The pouch is gimmicky and a touch small, but serves the purpose- I'll probably put them in something else. The headband can catch longer hair, but I wear a buzz, so that's not a problem. They're even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep. Some people complain about the style, but I've always loved it. They're easier to wear underneath a knit hat, or in conjunction with sunglasses. The design is eternal for a reason.You really can't do better at sub-$100. If your hair is longer, wrap electrical tape around the band- it won't collapse anymore, but you won't rip your hair out. If the stock pads don't satisfy, get some Grado bowl replacements (but the stock pads are fine.) If they break, send them into Koss for a replacement, $6 S&H.; The new model has an angled plug- not right-angle, but not straight either, which I find convenient for preventing cable-breakage but might not work with some cases.A testament to how good these headphones are- my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones. After he tried my new set on once, I had to order another pair the next day."
1607,0,"I tried this keyboard for a week. I really liked most things about it, but it has a killer weakness. The function keys don't work the way they should. When you boot, they are in this new &quot;enhanced&quot; mode. Some enhancement. I've been using computers for over 25 years, and now they change the function keys? They put a key on the keyboard that lets you toggle it, but you have to hit it every single time you boot! If you forget, you're doing stupid things like cutting and pasting or sending email instead of the action you thought you were taking.If they had an option to make it default to the normal state, I'd have kept it, but it's a deal breaker as is. I would have given this combo a 5 otherwise. I love the mouse, and cordless hookup is wonderful! This has to be the most bone-headed thing I've ever seen. I suppose if you never use your function keys, this keyboard will be great, but it's ridiculous as is. Get this - you have about 1/2 second to hit the FLock key (to toggle the function keys at boot) so you can hit the F2 key to get into the BIOS on your machine, or to hit F8 to get into safe mode. Hope you didn't miss it. I've been a happy and faithful Logitech user for 15 years. I will never buy another of their keyboards again as long as this feature is unchanged."
1608,2,"I bought this camera case for my Sony H1 zoom camera.  The camera fits great, there is no wobble, it fits securely.  It will also hold your lens hood and adapter ring, spare batteries and extra memory.  But it won't hold your battery charger or manual.  It will also be a tight fit to get your AV and USB cables in.  They might go in but I think it would harm my memory sticks so I'm leaving them out.  This is the bag for you for day trips or an overnight journey, especially if you only want the bare essentials.  But if you're leaving for a week and want to take everything with you (as I usually do) you'd be better off with a small camcorder bag instead.  The case is very sturdy but its not waterproof so forget about those flume rides."
1609,1,"I have no complains about this CLIE. I let go of my IPaq because it was too heavy and large to carry it with me all the time. So I decided to get the T615. The Palm OS works with less memory requirements than Windows CE, so you get much more storage capacity with a 16kb Clie than with a 32kb IPaq. However, I do find the display too small for my needs. I can barely tip the letters I want in the virtual keyboard with the stylus. Also, if you use quickbooks (excel look-alike), the display is just not enough.In addition, this unit is not MP3 equiped. The built in speaker is deficient."
1610,1,"Linksys markets this unit as having a VPN server that you can use to access the network it's connected to remotely (ie connect to your office network from your home computer). But be wary that this is not a simple task, is nearly undocumented, and may require additional 3rd party software if you have Windows XP Home edition. I spent more than a week and a half trying to make a VPN connection from my home PC, several tech support conversations, and used several forums and was never able to connect."
1611,1,great device to get!
1612,2,"I have two challenges which have made finding proper fitting ear buds problematic.  First, my ear canals are a bit on the small side.  (This issue does not transcend my ear canals but, I digress)  Second(ly), I'm missing that little flap of skin that other people have on their (misshapen) ears that holds ear buds in place.  Despite these challenges, these things stay in place, are quite comfortable, and sound good in the bargain.If you're interested, there is also a wealth of information on the Internets that explains how to modify these things to make them sound and fit even better.  For now, I'm plenty happy with what I got for my $12."
1613,2,"I bought these Koss ProPorta headphones after getting tired of the small in-ear headphones. I've had a bunch of them, including Bose and Bang & Olufsen. These are better than any of those. I was just looking for something to use with my computer at work. I don't use them a lot, but am now finding myself using them a lot more than I used to.For what I wanted these for and for the price, not sure how you can beat them. I've also had the high-end Bose noise canceling headphones, but they are so big and bulky that I just don't carry them with me when I travel. Several of the reviews commented on how hard it was to get these into the leather-like storage bag that comes with them. I did not find it a problem at all. They fold up and hook together and easily fit inside the bag. They are super comfortable (my hair is short so the hair pulling isn't an issue). The way they're built, they'll probably last forever or at least until I get tired of them.I wouldn't hesitate a moment to buy these. Hey if you don't like them, you're only out about $30. I'm not a sound expert, so they sound pretty darned good to me and much better than all the small ones I've been using."
1614,2,"These are by far the best sounding portable headphone I've ever heard. They are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type. The sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too. As far as style goes I've heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking. I'm not quite sure what the problem is. Just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers, not much you can do in the way of ""style"". If you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the SportaPro. For the money these are hard to beat. The sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is needed."
1615,0,"This is one of Netgear's newest and worst models.  It's ability to configure rules leaves much to be desired.  Although advertising states otherwise, their technical department, are at a loss for words (or answers).  Which brings to fact a second point.  This particular model is pretty much without knowledgable Netgear technical help.So if it's your ambition to find out &quot;What came first, The chicken or the egg?&quot;  this router is up your ally.  Cause you'll discover the answere to the Chicken riddle, before you can figure rules out for this router that will work consistantly."
1616,2,"I have had this trackball for over one year now. I've used the wired-USB version for my work laptop, so I wanted the wireless for my home laptop. The ergonomics are great. Like many others, this mouse fits your palm like a glove. Originally when I first started using trackballs, it took some getting used to, but once you get the feel for it, you'll be a trackball (more appropriately a ""thumb-ball"") pro.The buttons are well-located, convenient, and comfortable. You really don't feel like you need to hyperextend or move any of your digits to perform functions. The only digit of your hand that is active is your thumb.At its best, I have found the range on the trackball to be excellent. I have a desktop docking station for my laptop. I have the RF station hooked up to my dock. I can sit on my couch on the other side of my home office (6 - 7 ft away) with my laptop undocked and the trackball responsive at my side. Great responsiveness for a reasonable range.Now the quirks (keep in mind I have had this for over one year): sometimes the mouse becomes unresponsive and sluggish; the mouse pointer slows down, clicking may not work, and sometimes entire sections of a page may highlight simply by moving the pointer over a page. If the mouse is acting up, I've also found that shaking it around kind of helps ;-) That is my first line of triage for the mouse. If that doesn't work, I've found myself replacing the battery maybe 3-4 times over the past year, ""resetting"" the RF signal (you simultaneously push these little buttons on both the RF station and on the actual mouse).Another quirk/maintenance: mouse-lint builds up inside the trackball on the little nubs that hold the ball up. Also, its good to clean the optical sensor window now and then as that can accumulate dirt and oil as well.Since I have both the wired and wireless versions of this trackball, I can say that the wireless one is not as crisp and responsive as the USB-wired one, but it is not noticeable when the wireless is working at its peak condition.This is a great trackball for ergo-lovers. The quirks are tolerable. I'd love to see a bluetooth version and see what the performance difference would be!"
1617,2,"I mounted this on the wall and boy do they stick. Don't try to take it off: it will rip the paint it's adhered to as well. Once that bad-boy is pressed on it's there for life. If there ever were a tornado in Sacramento, I'd hold onto this thing for dear life."
1618,0,This will need drivers on ALL OSs.  On windows 2003 you will need to put the cable and reinsert it after installing the drivers on Windows 7 and Windows Vista you will also need drivers.
1619,0,I bought 4 packages of these and they were all defective/not for digital audio music recorders. I called tdk which make IMATION media. They told me to check out each disk and send them the defective ones. Well all 200 are defective. So they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder. My dual cd philips machine didnt recognize these disks which say tdk music. The recorder rejected every one. Either it gave a error or said insert disc meanwhile it was in there. I dont recommend these model # discs for the philips dual cd recorder. I always bought tdk all my life and since Imation is involved i no longer buy them. I use maxell only for the dual philips recorder. I bought 200 discs and work flawlessly. If you have the philips cd-r dual deck use the maxells they are worth it. They say on them cd-r music for DIGITAL AUDIO 80 min and are used for the philips dual deck.
1620,0,"I've been through at least 3 of these.  Though the reviews are right that the sound is good and it is quite comfortable, it's not clear why Panasonic does not fix the simple flaw--except if it's to get us buying more.  The head band and the ear piece are held together with a flimsy piece of plastic that breaks with the slightest tension.  Mine, like other reviewers', is currently glued together.I am looking for a different model, as the price no longer justifies the product."
1621,0,"WARNING: DWL-650+ may corrupt firmware on HP laptops.  The DWL-650+ software would not install on my target HP Omnibook, so I tried it on my newest HP Omnibook, which already had built-in wireless.  Performance review: the DWL-650+ worked irratically.  After I uninstalled the D-Link software, my laptop's internal wireless was no longer functioned.  I am a SW/HW engineer, and after 20 hours of work and calls to D-Link support, I believe that the laptop's original wireless firmware has been corrupted beyond repair -- a sickning price to pay.  For me, nightime D-Link support was helpful; daytime support struck me as ignorant and rude.  Their email response to my request for escallation: ""Dear: Valued Customer ...

1622,0,"This was the first Canon product (camera,lens,extender, etc.) that I was truly disappointed in having. First of all, the ""sliding"" design of the zoom is a minus. The one I received, when angled down at all, caused it to zoom,(but it slid smoothly!). The quality wasn't there for me, compared to the Sigma 120-400 at $600 less. I tried both lenses at the same time, and ended up sending the Canon back."
1623,2,"Shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product. The lock and cable appear to be of good quality. The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models. It was listed and purchased as a used item, but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones. How much abuse can a lock like this take? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Amazon. If there is ever a problem, it is accepted back immediately."
1624,2,"It's not a Pocket Wizard, but for what it's intended for it'll do fine. The more I shoot, the more I shoot full manual - Radio Poppers and PW's are the way to go there.Sometimes though, when we have people over, I will set up 2 580EX's pointed at the ceiling and use the ST-E2 to capture group shots.  Works great - never ever fails to trigger the flashes.  For portraits indoors I have been known to hide a flash behind a chair, set to manual at 1/64 as a hair light, and a main light camera right or left. The flash hidden behind the chair fires too, with the IR signal bouncing off walls and such.For fast, ad-hoc throwdowns where I don't have time to set the shot up perfectly, I'll use this thing with ETTL and let the camera meter the shots.  This is what I imagine this thing will be best for: clackering off quick shots without thought, when time is tight, let the camera's meter do the work.So while this device is perfectly fine indoors...it's outdoors that it starts to cool off - better at night, oddly, but still not great unless the flash units are pretty close to the emitter.  I knew that going in, though, so I'll limit my review to indoor stuff.4 instead of 5 stars?  That damn battery.  This thing is showing it's age, using a 2CR5 battery.  They're expensive and sometimes hard to find.  As for battery life...we'll see.Meanwhile the Radio Popper people state this device is use ALONGSIDE their remotes...I don't know how, but I'm going to find out..."
1625,0,"A simple portable radio that can be powered by the supplied AC power cord or by 4 AA batteries (not supplied). No storage is provided for the AC cord - an annoyance.I'm an electrical engineer. This portable certainly plays loudly enough but reception, particularly on the FM band, is not good. AM reception was decent, pulling in signals from high powered AM stations that were 60+ miles away without a problem.FM reception was not nearly as good. This radio had trouble pulling in many FM stations in my area. I first compared it to my car stereo parked just 10 feet away and then an old, beat up portable radio, from Radio Shack that was 20 years old. Both were much better than the Panasonic. FM signal reception is mediocre at best. Both the sensitivity (the ability to pick up a station) and selectivity (the ability to tune into one station that is near another one) was fair to poor. On the plus side, this inexpensive portable will work in a power outage and provide music when you are out and about. Its volume is fairly loud.So for $36.00 what can you expect? Maybe (?) no more than this radio provides.In short, I was expecting far better reception from this radio. A mono radio, technically should have far better performance than a stereo one such as that used in your car (yet car radios are very well made) so maybe that is not a fair comparison.The Sony ICF38 may be the better choice. The Sony ICF-38 seems almost identical to this Panasonic (offering both battery and AC power) yet it has far better reviews.I ordered the Sony ICF10 and tested it side by side with this Panasonic. Now this Sony is battery operated only and costs about a third of the Panasonic. The Panasonic was  better in one important aspect: it played much louder! It also pulled in a few more FM stations. Now this is not an entirely fair test, given the difference in price but many reviews lead me to believe that ALL Sony portables were better. That is certainly NOT the case regarding Sony's ICF10. The Panasonic is much better regarding volume but only slightly better in reception.The Sony ICF-f38 is roughly comparable in price and offers both battery and AC operation. It is a model you should consider but candidly I'm tired of testing portable radios and I'll live with this Panasonic - its OK (at best) but years ago you could get far better for the same price. I wish I had the energy to test it against the Sony ICF38It is hard to recommend this radio but I'm too lazy to ship it back. This review is far from complete because I can only tell you the the very inexpensive Sony ICF-10 is even worse (hard to believe) and just possibly - the Sony ICF-38 MIGHT be better.The one take away from my review should be that this Panasonic is a mediocre radio"
1626,2,Most cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to 20 Hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim. The clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazing.
1627,1,"I had these speakers for a few years and generally they were pretty good speakers, although a bit more expensive. Unfortunately, I just barely moved my sub woofer and the cord's DIN connector broke off making them essentially worthless. I guess there is a replacement part, but I ended up scrapping my set for something else."
1628,0,Broke after a year of usage. The retractable prongs wouldn't stay up. The switch that controls retractable prongs broke and the whole thing was useless.
1629,2,"I have an Olympus 3020, and this bag fits ""just right.""  I can get the camera in, a battery charger, and an extra memory card.  That's all that fits perfectly, though.  The USB cable doesn't fit in.If you want a bag for a smaller camera, this is great.  The clips on the strap are solid metal, and the inside compartment is useful in that it has places for batteries and memory cards.  If you get anything bigger than a traditional point-and-shoot, though, you should look a little harder for a better suited bag."
1630,0,"This is a device you either love or hate. You love it if you plug it in and everything works fine. You hate it if your devices won't work with it.I'm in the latter category. I decided to replace my old 4-port hub with this 7-port device even though I haven't (yet) added more USB devices. I had my printer, scanner, card reader and PDA cradle plugged into my old HUB and everything was working smoothly. I succumbed to the temptation of getting a high-speed HUB since my newer devices are high-speed and I got tired of the ""this device can perform faster"" message from windows.I installed this Hub and the printer and scanner both registered and installed perfectly. I plugged in my card reader and the computer wouldn't recognize it. I unplugged it and reinstalled the software. Still couldn't get it to recognize it. I plugged it directly into my computer and it ran fine.Same thing happened with my mobile device.After working for several hours to get everything to work, including reinstalling the software, I set everything up on my old hub and again everything ran fine.I've been working with computers since the old CPM days (including DOS!) and I'm not such a rookie that I can't plug in a new USB Hub. I'm returning this unit for a refund.A few other frustrating things I encountered:1) The hard plastic packaging was extremely hard to get into. I ended up practically tearing it to shreds.2) There is minimal documentation. An insert says to refer to the owners manual on the enclosed CD -- but there IS NO CD!3) The Quick Installation Guide says nothing about needing to reinstall device software. Only when you go on the D-Link support website do you read this information.4) As others have noted, if you are using even a single USB 1.1 device, there is a chance that ALL devices connected to the hub (even high speed ones) will work at USB 1.1 speed. So much for ""backwards compatible."""
1631,2,I bought this for my lenses for my new Canon Rebel T-3. It holds the lenses and gadgets well. It's fairly easy to carry. I got one just like it at Wal-Mart for the T3. I paid more at Wal-Mart. I do have one small gripe- the color. Olive green is fine but it feels a little GI Joe camo to me. I would have preferred all black or possibly sea blue on the bottom.
1632,1,"I wish I could give this player a great rating but, in fact, I have very little I can go on for the rating except that mine was defective straight out of the package. Thus, I can't go on about sound quality or other features. It felt sturdy. The controls seemed easy to operate. It just didn't play. The CD would cycle but that was the extent of its performance. I had no trouble getting through to Sony on the phone (always a plus)and after a brief discussion they agreed that it was a malfunctioning unit. I have several Sony items and this is the first time I've gotten a lemon. Based on prior experience, I won't hesitate to buy Sony again but this time I am going to select a different Walkman CD player (the next &quot;grade&quot; up.)"
1633,0,I bought a DVD for my son within the last 2 years and now the unit is displaying error code H07.  Do not buy Panasonic.
1634,0,After one week of having them they broke. I take very good care of things but one day no sound would come out of them. It is a waste of money. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE!
1635,2,Like it because it is sturdy and well built but 4 stars because it gets pretty cramped in it with 1 EOS Rebel and 2 lenses. The camera would not fit in it with the 55-250 mm lens attached to it.
1636,1,"Overall, this is a good product to help keep the glove box tidy. It seems a bit too narrow though. It won't hold standard envelopes."
1637,2,"I am not an audiophile by any means, but the PortaPro headphones are exceptional.  The sound is, especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit, clear with a more than adequate amount of bass.  As a bonus, the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful.  Bottom line...a funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience.  Try them...you'll like them!!"
1638,0,"I just bought a Toshiba e755 from Amazon and expected to use a pair of SanDisk 256MB SD cards but when all parts arrived, the SanDisk cards seem to be nonfunctional in this PDA (even though several reviews of both SD and PDA used both together!)When I inquired at Toshiba, they didn't confirm or deny that the SanDisk products should or wouldn't work, they merely said to check the manufacturer's website for a compatibilty list.When I did that and selected SD cards and Toshiba products, no results came up which, while not stating it unequivocally, implies that SanDisk SD media is not compatible with the Toshiba products!How something with an ""SD Logo"" on it would end up being incompatible with another product also bearing that same logo is beyond me.So you may want to think twice before buying this SanDisk SD card if you have a Toshiba e750/755"
1639,0,"I'm currently using these as an extension from my headphones to my TV so I can hear it over the sound of my elliptical machine without having to crank the volume. I've got a decent set of Sony workout headphones that I've never had any issue with but when I plug them into this extension and then into the headphone jack on the side of the tv, I pick up some static in the background. Seems strange given that the wiring (or at least the rubber insulation) is pretty heavy duty. In fact, I'd actually prefer a less heavy-duty wire as the weight of it tugs on my headphones and I had to find a work-around for it."
1640,0,I did not have a serial connection on my notebook - So I purchased this item based on (other people not needing the disc/drivers to be installed and they were saying it works perfectly out of the box.)This item is not defective in any way and works on com6 on my notebook when I try to connect to a Cisco Console Port. Only problem I have is that every time I disconnect and reconnect the usb adapter - the driver is never recognized and I have to reinstall the product over every time I would like to use it. And it seems that the driver never releases the com port properly so even when I disconnect the physical connection it still makes my computer think there is a device attached when there isn't.I am not saying everyone will have this issue. The pc I am running is an HP notebook with windows xp pro sp3 installed. It is a clean installation - only thing on the PC is a Cisco VPN Client and the drivers for the notebook.
1641,0,"Be careful - there are two different versions of this.  Be sure to buy the correct one, not this one; there's a power delay when in use during a surge.  The other one looks just like it and the portability is great!"
1642,1,"I got this as a replacement to use in a very old, custom PC, which uses an AGP graphics card and runs on an Athlon CPU. I like the All-In-Wonder cards because they have A/V-in and A/V-out connections built-in.  This is very handy for transferring old VHS tapes to your PC or to a DVD.  The card also has a TV tuner built in, butit is analog-only and no longer usable."
1643,1,I use the NB-2L from Canon with my S45 and I also hve some aftermarket batteries. I am surprised that the canon isnt lasting a lot longer then the aftemarket batteries. Dont get me wrong it works ok but not sure it is worth spending a lot more to get the canon
1644,2,"Great for use instead of the self timer, as well as for hands-off operation for tripod setups. This model has instant shot and 2-second delay modes, both of which I have found useful."
1645,2,"When you set the volume on your music player, it goes in steps and is hard to get the loudness you want. This helps fine tune your volume to the exact spot you want it! I really recommend this so you can get the volume you want."
1646,0,Well first the reception. Am at times is no better than the little clock radio/phone combo sitting 3 inches from this unit on my night stand. Didn't expect better FM reception nor did I get it. At least the speaker was bigger and sounded better than the clock radio. It cost me money to have the LED display fixed when it failed after a few years. Seems this happened to a LOT of units. The fixed version is holding up so far. I happened to call yesterday to see if there was anything I could do about boosting FM reception. Finally a talk radio station in my area but its FM. A really nice person tried to help but after exhausting all avenues it was suggested I clip another lead on my pull up antenna and run it outside. For a radio this expensive hanging a piece of wire on the antenna would look like a redneck job. She then said she would find out if a mod they used to do ( sounds like I wasn't the only one that wished it had an fm jack in the back ) was still available. At least this would make the radio usable. I'm waiting for her call. This radio should be better than it is for the price.
1647,1,"I got these a couple years ago based on the very positive user reviews. I think I had come from a similar set of Koss phones that I really liked but had become obsolete.The sound and build quality of these phones are great for the price. The sound cannot be called first rate, but it is pretty full with good bass. The mids and highs are not balanced quite to my taste but again, at this price you can't complain too much.My only serious complaint is that after wearing these for about a half hour my ears get sore and I have to take them off. I'm not sure exactly what the problem is - it could be the size of the ear pads combined with a pretty tight fit, or it could very well just be that my ears are an odd size. In any case it has become something of a deal breaker for long periods of listening.I don't want to dissuade anyone in light of all the glowing reviews here, but I thought I should throw my two cents in. Everyone's ears are different. If you can find a seller with a good return policy you could give them a try and then return them if they don't fit right."
1648,0,"This thing randomly stopped working after a few weeks of perfectly fine use.Prior to that, the only problem I had was that it takes up too much space.  Although it has prongs for only one socket, you can't put it in the bottom socket and have the top socket free, for example.  Also, the fact that it uses one socket, and has six ports drawing energy from that one socket, probably contributed to its completely conking out."
1649,0,"I am using the DBT-120 ver B3 to operate the wireless Apple keyboard and mouse.  If my computer goes into the sleep mode, I cannot wake it up by typing on the keyboard and I have to use the power key on the Apple monitor.  When the computer does eventually wake up, it takes a good 2-3 min before the mouse would work.  Apple tech support says that they have seen this problem and went through a few solutions but none worked and I was asked to talk to D-link.  The D-link tech supports told me that their software stops running when the computer goes to sleep and that is why my keyboard and mouse do not work, and there is no solution to that.  Thus, if you plan to use D-link when the computer goes to sleep, it won't work.  I am sticking with my wired keyboard and mouse now."
1650,2,Appears to be sturdy and function as intended.  No issues.  It will work with a Targus PA400P Defcon security baseplate (but &#34;threading the needle&#34; is a bit tight).
1651,0,"Even with the transmitter and receiver less than 8' apart, it didn't work.I tried it with the receiver's built-in IR, with the IR cable that was provided, and even with a more expensive cable that comes with the Slingbox."
1652,2,"Works just as advertised with my XTi. However some people commented about using it behind the camera, unfortunately I could never get it to work that way."
1653,0,"Logitech Manufacturers rebate is a farce, you will not get the rebate in most probablity. In spite of sending all the required forms etc for an earlier Logitech product, they say I have not sent the &quot;Original UPC&quot; code. Ha !"
1654,1,"The polk website gives more realistic frequency information.The 30Hz - 20kHz is a little deceptive.  Notice the ""Lower -3db Limit"" is 50Hz.For example, the 8 inch speakers:Overall Frequency Response  30Hz - 20kHzLower -3dB Limit  50HzUpper -3dB Limit  20kHzNominal Impedance  8 ohmsRecommended Amplifier Power  20 - 100 w/channelEfficiency  90 dB"
1655,1,I liked this mouse alot.  It was very confortable and easy to use but it stopped working after less than a year.
1656,2,"If you have a big lens like 24-105mm or bigger, it will not fit when its fixed on camera.I will get a bigger one for my extra lenses and othe gera like flash and ect..but its good for body and one small lens. Good quality too."
1657,2,Took several re-reads of the instructions to get this to work with my camera.  It's been working well ever since.  Great products with below average instructions.  BTW - I'm an engineer who reads manuals and instructions and usually get things right the first time.  Reading instructions is time well spent.
1658,2,"As a drummer I normally opt for bigger headsets that are enclosed, especially for playing electronic drums... the problem is that they don't let your head & ears breathe, making it uncomfortable to wear for long sessions.I bought these with the intention of using them for my mp3 player, but I thought, why not give them a try with the V-Drum kit.  WOW!  These cans really pump... the frequency range was something I totally did not expect, especially when monitoring a live electronic music instrument - drums no less!  These headphones handled the pounding drum sounds perfectly and with no fatigue at all.  I was able to also hear other live instruments as well.  The only drawback is the level at which these headphones start to distort out... (now this is a level which I believe is way beyond normal listening levels - remember, this is from a band rehearsal at full volume.)So, during a solo practice session, these did a phenominal job.  However, it is a lot to ask these headphone to be the primary monitor cans during a full blown gig - the sound pressure levels are too much.But, if you're looking for great headphones that are comfortable to where for long periods and sound fantastic, then these are the ones!I highly recommend them!"
1659,2,"Please note, this will not make your music louder. It will simply control the volume - that's it.  Now that I've said this, let's move on.I love this little device.  It works great with my Samsung S3 and Poweramp app. Sometimes I get tired of taking my Samsung in an out of my pocket just to adjust the volume - as there are some songs a bit louder than others like there are some commercials on tv that are louder than others. Well, I don't have to do that any longer. I have the Koss Volume Control clipped on the wire part of my Sony headphones and I'm good to go. I owned one before but I must have lost it during relocating and I was really missing it.(I will update this review if any problems arise from this device)."
1660,0,"This lens is overrated.  I just took two shots of newspaper print with my XSI camera in low-light.  One with this 50mm f1.8 lens at 1/160 and f2.8, and the other with my 18-55mm IS kit lens at 1/40, f5.6.  The resulting image with the 18-55mm kit lens was much sharper.  So my simple test proved (to me anyways) that the IS makes the kit lens a better low-light performer (unless you need the higher shutter speed to stop the action).  The only other reason to get this lens is the shallower depth-of-field afforded by the wider aperture.  I would really find this useful, but the other thing I've noticed about this lens is that it often misses the focus.  So I can't trust it.Also feels far too fragile to throw the lens in my camera bag."
1661,2,"I do like this bag. It's small, light, and sturdy. It has a small front pouch for CF cards and spare batteries or battery pack. You can attach it to your belt or use the adjustable shoulder strap. Very versatile. It would have easily gotten 5 stars if it had just a little more room.  I have a Canon Powershot G2 and the fit is snug, which is what I wanted. However, there's no room for any cords (and barely room for the neck strap on my camera). The Digital 4 bag could have used one thin, long pouch on the side for extra little camera accessories.If you don't have a camera larger than the Canon G2 (and most are not larger) and you want a bag that's compact and well built but only has enough room for the bare necessities instead of a lot of pouches and pockets for extra items, then this bag should suit you very nicely. It's perfect if you want a camera bag that is small and unobstrusive but have no desire to carry any extras while you're on the go."
1662,0,"I read the rebate problems some have encountered here, but I still bought it. I recieved a denial from the company for not recieving the ""original UPC"". I had sent the ORIGINAL and I no longer have it to resend. How am I supposed to prove that I did? Even if I had a copy of it, it still wouldn't prove that I had sent the original. Go figure. My impression is that I'm dealing with crooks, who tease you with the rebate and find an execuse not to honor the rebate. I called them (after going through a maze of prompts on a long distance call) and they promised to take care of it in 6-140 weeks. I'm still waiting.My advice if you're buying it because of the incentive rebate, don't.As for the quality of the product, I can't comment since I bought as a gift for a relative overseas. Haven't heared from him yet."
1663,2,I looked around and after reading the reviews i picked this up and was not disappointed.The fluid head is very smooth for pans and tilts. A surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps locked.The only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expect.
1664,1,"I don't do much wide angle photography but I've had this lens for years and took it on a hike last summer with a Canon 5D Mark II. It has good center sharpness but even at f10 the corners are somewhat smeary. This is perfectly acceptable for a 20mm lens at this price.The lens has none of the warm/golden color that older Sigma lenses had like the 17-35mm. It has bright even color and contrast like a Canon lens. It does have Sigma's klutzy two step focus motor system. To switch between AF and MF, you have to flip a switch that is physically connected to the mechanical gears and then slide the focus ring to the correct position. Failure to do this can put stress on the focus gears and possibly damage them.Shooting wide open with a fast lens like this can create some interesting effects. It was great for picking out a single flower while exaggerating the size of everything else in the field which is out of focus and fills most of the frame."
1665,1,"WHITE discs, not the usual silver which i prefer. Other than that okay. I just would have preferred silver. I wish the description had specified this fact."
1666,2,"I just got done installing this in my TV room, and after a couple hours of swearing at it and trying to jam all the wires in it that needed to be in it, my only conclusion is that this product is designed for 2-3 wires MAX. I needed to get the TV power cord, HDMI cord, and three 16 AWG speaker wires through it...and it took every ounce of patience I had to finish the job. The other issue is that once you stick this stuff to the wall, it is PERMANENT. It will rip off the paint, texturing, and half of the drywall paper...so you better be committed once you stick it down!Other than that, it looks good, and works well as long as you only need to put a few wires in it. If I were doing it over again, I would have gotten two kits, a narrower one for the speaker wire runs (single wire) and a larger kit for the cable bundle that runs to the amp."
1667,1,It was a good lens that lasted a few years but roughly 2 years if use and the internal motor gears went bad. Now our Canon camera has an error message when this lens is attach. I would personally spend a little more money for better quality lens
1668,0,"Hoped to replace an aging microphone screen with this one and eventhough it met the specs, it tore immediately and fell off - so - waste of money."
1669,2,This year I bought a Dell Vostro laptop. It turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones. Someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence. I didn't expect it to work but it does. The Koss VC20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable. I am completely satisfied.
1670,1,"I got this for [$] and that's why I don't regret buying it.  Too be honest I still don't know much about how to use it, partly because I'm too lazy to tinker with something that to me should just be a glorified walkman, but partly because the stupid thing came with basically no manual.Aside from that I use this thing 5 days a week at the gym and in the car with a tape deck adapter and I can't complain.  Occasionally it locks up on me when I load a new playlist or something, so I have to pull the batteries or hit the reset button (need a paperclip for that).  Apparently you can only have 2 playlists and mine seem to change at random, sometimes appending each other and sometimes overwriting ... but I am lazy when it comes to this thing, I admit that.The interface software works fine with win2k and is about as dummy-proof as possible, although I must complain that the Nomad doesn't recognize a lot of my music (probably due to missing tags) so it files the songs under ""unknown"".  My filenames are very hierarchical and descriptive; I don't care about tags, but I can't get this behavior to change."
1671,2,"This is not the world's best walking stick, nor is it a tripod, nor is it a blunt weapon.  However, ours lives in the car, and has served all three purposes quite well.  If we're heading on a hike, and feel we might need to either have a little extra traction, or take some zoom or low light photos, or keep some ""Oh he's just growling"" off-leash dog away from our ankles, this is a great solution.  If it were sturdier, it would be heavier.  The only reason for 4 stars is I think it could be a little cheaper - but then again I have no QC issues, so maybe it's worth it."
1672,0,"Let's be honest, the speaker in this thing sounds terrible.  It's so shrill and scratchy that AM stations sound hissy and off-frequency, and FM sounds like a toy.  Maybe it sounds better through headphones but if you're going to listen to it that way then you might as well get a DT-110 which is a great headphone-only radio.On top of the bad sound, the plastic case on this one looks really cheap.On the positive side, it has a sensitive tuner and good features. I especially liked the alarm clock feature.  If only Sangean could have made this one sound as good as their SG-622 it would have been a keeper but I can't stand to listen to it so it's going back."
1673,0,"I bought this item for use with my Tivo.  It it was one of their two recommended USB network adaptors (the other is Linksys 100TX and I had to replace that 3 times within 6 months).  Now that it's broke I am on hold with their tech support and it's a very painful exsperience.  They are getting worse and worse.  The item itself is VERY flimsy like other users have stated.  It just stopped working for no reason.  I will never buy a linksys adator again, they should stick with making routers and hubs."
1674,0,I bought this modem to run with my IVM (Interactive Voice Machine) I did finely get it to work. Some problems I encountered.No CD and not enough paperwork to download the drivers. I called tech support and they said download here. The driver they have wasn't an exe file. I spent too much time figuring it out. I had to beat it into my computer. (lol)Full duplex no way this is a half duplex modem. just copy the full duplex and half duplex and past it into Google and do your research. Also the caller I.D didn't work at all. BummerThe Multi-Tech website has software that you can download to use with the modem but you had to buy it. I did try the software but I wouldn't buy it for the price. It was hard to use and it had a doss like look and ran like doss. you can find better phone software on the net.
1675,2,These are the heavy duty version.  That means extra heft and a bit stiffer than your smaller ties.  These aren't for delicate bundling but they'll shine where you need the strength.
1676,1,"I bought this to replace the factory sub woofer that failed; you cannot get the factory sub anymore.  It required holes to be drilled (came with six and box had eight), but the depth was fine and required no other modification to fit.  The sound with the factory amp is just OK.  The factory magnet was heavier, so I am thinking that is part of the problem."
1677,0,"The connectors on the card I received are different from the one depicted on the amazon webpage. I cannot use it because it does not fit into my PC's slot. Now it's too late to return it, unfortunately."
1678,1,they are nice but they were slightly bent/smashed when i got them.  i had to twist them a little.  they are very light weight.
1679,0,"My son has a Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman  & uses it as a back up to a corded mouse. He likes it but when I go one and tried it, I kept scooting it along the Keyboard pull-out table. The Logitech cordless trackball works much better for me."
1680,2,"I have a SX50HS Canon Camera. With its powerful zoom (50X optical) and (200X Digital) it gives you an excellent way to take pictures of distant objects. However, in some cases you will need more stabilization that the camera offers with its internal automatic features. In this case, you need this device.PROS;- Small size- Simple operationCONS:- Cord is shorter than would be desiredI recommend it."
1681,2,"My conundrum when purchasing this mouse was whether to purchase the Microsoft one or the Logitech one.  I took a chance on the Logitech mouse, and I must say that I have not regretted it.  Not only is Logitech mouse less expensive than the mouse created by Microsoft, but it is also of about equal quality.  Aesthetically the Logitech mouse looks great, one of the coolest features is the glowing blue Logitech logo on the back to the mouse.  Installing it was a breeze, I just plugged it into my USB port and Windows auto detected it and installed the appropriate drivers automatically.  Although overall this is a good mouse, it does have some problems.  The wheel feels flimsy to the touch and scrolling is a bit difficult.  If you heavily use the scroll wheel, you should consider the Microsoft mouse.  Although the Logitech mouse does not give you as good a feel as the Microsoft mouse, it is adequate nonetheless.  Another thing that you might find difficult with this mouse is getting adjusted to it in the beginning.  It takes a while to get adjusted to the shape of the mouse, but after a few days it will feel natural.  I would recommend this mouse for anyone seeking a new mouse and is looking to purchase an optical mouse.  Once you have tried optical, you won't want to go back to the regular ball mouse."
1682,2,"Punchline:I have looked around and can't think of any over-the-ear headphones with a $35 price point which would sound better than Koss PortaPro's.FYI, there is a newer model which has a remote on its cable and supports iOS devices.I remember drooling over these way back in the day when one of my favorite European hi-fi magazines used to use these as a reference for all portable headphones. They deserved it. And although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by, PortaPro's have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more. I would not hesitate for a second to put PortaPro's above Dr. Dre's Beats (which are an over priced, mediocre sounding) phenomenon these days.Design:PortaPro's draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy. :-) Fit is great, the temporal pads can adjust their pressure, hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears The bridge is self-adjusting consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other, though, the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair, you may feel it after awhile. Also, if you have long hair, or lots of it (not my problem), your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulled.Cable is oxygen-free, has a 45 degree angled 3.5mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones. It is not replaceable, so if it breaks, you need new cans. Koss honors limited lifetime warranty, if you register.Sound:They sound as good as my AKG Q460, maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble. Due to their construction, they do not isolate outside noise as well, so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up. Beware, their bass is powerful, so treat your ear drums with some care.Listening to PortPro's at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joy.Treble, mids and bass are in a great balance, so these cans do not require much tinkering with EQ. I actually use the ""Flat"" equalizer setting on my iPod.Impedance is 60 Ohm, so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard 32 Ohm headphones to make PortaPro's sound at the same level of loudness.I bought them at K-Mart which was closing and they had them marked for $32.I will eventually buy the 6-pack of replacement foam ear pads.Included is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely, so good news for road warriors."
1683,2,No complaints at all.  Make sure you get the right case for the many Garmin models.  This is not an easy task.
1684,0,"I've used this radio for a while now, and I've concluded that it's not very usable.  The problem with it is the tuning dial.  It's tiny!  Everytime I want to tune in a station it takes ages to try to get it tuned properly.  If your use is always to tune in one of the 4 or 5 most prominent stations on the dial, then this will work fine.  If not, I strongly suggest getting something with a digital tuner.  It isn't that much more expensive and will save you endless headaches."
1685,2,"My husband uses the bag for his camera. Plenty of room, lightweight, durable, and we took it to NYC yesterday when we took the Circle Line tour...."
1686,1,"Well, first of all, I am a technology addicted person.I am migrating from the Pocket PC world to this Palm world due to corporate standard. This Palm m515 is light, has a cool design and has many nice applications, it must be said. But what I don't like is the lack of options for production. With my Pocket PC I could use PCMCIA cards and share my notebook's modem; I could have a video card and use my ""PowerPoint"" on a presentation, I could use my GPRS card and have the iPaq working as a cellphone, as a browser and so on...The integration with Windows is nice, nothing to complain. The applications that come with this m515 is nice, especially for the Documents to Go. I do encourage people to spend some more bucks (I guess [price]) and have the upgrade deal for the pro, since you can then download PDF files and edit your PowerPoint presentations.There is a company (MARGI.com) that is about to release an SD card that will allow users to have a VGA projector connected to this m515 (cool!).Unfortunately I was told by Palm support that only the Black&White-screened; m705 will have wireless internet capability; there is no planned SD card for the Palm m515 (so far!). The only wireless available is the Bluetooth card that allows you to use your bluetooth compatible cellphone as a gateway (As you see, far from the Pocket PC seamless technology). I hope I don't have to rent a U-Haul trailler to carry on all my bulky add-ons. :-)I do encourage people to also spend some more bucks and get the extended warranty from Palm. They cover broken LCDs!!!!! And it is about 10% of the device's street price.So, making a long story short:Just buy this device if you only use a PDA for gaming, AvantGo offline pages (such as stock, news etc.) on a traffic jam or at the airport, quick review of a presentation on an airplane (with no chance to use your PDA for performing the presentation), quick review of a spreadsheet and e-mail revision between a meeting and the other.If you really want a PDA to substitute your notebook most of the time, disregard the price difference and get a Pocket PC. Otherwise you will just get upset!"
1687,2,"I bought this item after going through so much research. I was interested in this because it is in CNET's top 5 and so many good reviews in Amazon. So I don't think one more elaborated review is not necessary but I want to focus on some issues specifically.1)comfort: I bought a sony MDR-XB500 (for it's extreme comfort and good sound quality) after I buying Koss PortaPro thinking that Koss is pressing my ears too hard because, my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours. Afterwards I noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from KOSS. If you listen at little less volume it shouldn't be a problem.2)Mechanical issues: There are glides on the Headphone for light and Firm wear but when I put them in light mode they just don't stay there. They come to firm position once I touch the phones. One more thing, unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse. This is not an annoying problem for me because I have a big head. Slowly my ears are used to this, and I can listen for longer times and I am listening at low sound levels. So I changed my decision to return these and I am keeping them.Just to list the Pros and Cons I experienced.Pros: Best sound quality, light weight, portable, extra bass (you love it),Cons: Design not up to the mark, Mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position. Extra bass (You can hurt your ears)."
1688,2,"Great sound out of these guys, they have an excellent bass reproduction, and treble is where it should be, overall a wonderful balance. The midrange is excellent, with instruments apparent I didn't know were there. They are also very light, so if you're confident enough in how they look, you can wear them around.the main point of my review was to say they are iPhone FRIENDLY, atleast the ones I got from Amazon directly.Would definitely recommend if you need something under a hundred dollars."
1689,2,"I purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip.  I used these headphones on the flight to and back from Europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies.  If you can live with the design, these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable price."
1690,1,"I bought this adapter for myZune HD.  It arrived earlier than expected, so I didn't have my Zune with me at the time I received the adapter.  A while after I inserted the adapter into the cassette player in my car, I found out that there is a lose mechanical part in the adaper, that makes noise when the road condition is not perfect, which is almost everywhere at Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately that became my first impression about the device.I'm not sure it's a trick I didn't know or what, but apparently if you want to have quality sound, you need to tune the volume of your player to the highest, and then have a sub-normal setting on your car stereo.  If you have your car stereo at the normal setting, and tune your player volume accordingly, the sound quality is terrible. From time to time I feel like the songs don't sound the same as those I burned into CDs, but most of the time, as long as the volume on the player goes to the maximum, the sound quality is decent.I guess I expected a little bit more from this adapter, though in general it does do the job."
1691,2,"I don't know how someone could give these anything below three stars. Sure, I could understand four, but two stars? These things are amazing! The only two cons I would have are that 1) they could be more portable: the ""earpieces"" don't rotate, so when you compress everything down to its most portable size, it's still more of a sphere than a circle. 2) Yes, I know that open-backed speakers are known for better sound, but I've had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song I'm listening to because these things ""leak out"" so much sound. The main problem with this (other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you) is that they don't work very well for plane riding or anything where it's loud (It was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week). Other than those two things, these things are great. Speaking of folding flat earpieces, one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers, (I probably spelled that wrong) and he used to lend them to me for a long time until I got these, but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead! So overall, I recommend these to anyone who just wants a cheap, yet VERY high quality pair of cans (but check out the Grado sr80i/60i, they may be a little bit less portable, but they're that much more amazing!)."
1692,0,I have had trouble using these tapes. They do not record so great and I'm wondering if they are old or just not very good quality.

1694,0,"First let me state that for low priced computer speakers, under $100, Cyber Acoustics is the best out there and cannot be touched.  Usually you get three to four times your money when you buy their products and I cannot say enough good things about them.That said these are absolutely atrocious! I could write a long review justifying why but simply put these speakers, if you can call them that, are horrible but let's just say they have no quality at any end whatsoever. Don't bother with the EQ they just suck and are not worth looking at any further.If you want a much better speaker that is comparable in size and price check-out these: CA-2014rb Amplified Computer Speaker System (Cyber Acoustics).If you want to go a step up in price and get superior sound and volume check-out these: Cyber Acoustics 3 pc Subwoofer/Satellite System CA-3602I own both and can recommend either in good conscience although I like the latter much better than any computer speakers I have ever owned.BOTH ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM AMAZONWhatever you do stay clear of these...they are pure junk!"

Good volume range easy to set to right level. Cord a bit long, when adding to my already long earphones cord, but I just coil up the volume control extra ! Good 1/8"" plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord. Getting another for my Koss headphones. Clip on it, to affix to like a belt."
1696,2,"I know there are a million great reviews for these phones. I'm speaking directly to Longevity now.I got Koss PortaPro phones ages ago, I think I got mine in 1998. Seriously: I bought them specifically for listening to FTP- begotten MP3 files before I found Napster.These were the best phones I ever found, for these three reasons:1) They aren't monitors, so I can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name. Ear goggles would not allow that.... When my kids are sleeping, and I need to hear any cries in the night, this is critical. Also I could use them at work.2) They provide excellent response range, and I assessed this in my 20's, when I could still hear over 20MHz.3) And now, I swear to you FOURTEEN YEARS LATER, I'm listening to the same phones, and still loving the sound quality.  I've had to replace the pads, I've long since lost the case, but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when I want good sound quality with my netflix streaming. The metal has not even a blemish.... FWIW, I have not had to replace the temple pads. For some reason those have not deteriorated. I don't get it, logically they should've.Anyway, whenever my kids break these, I will buy another pair, with unreserved exuberance.aside: Koss also OEMs some of the headphones for Radio Shack. I had a much less favorable experience with those phones. You should stick with the brand-name version. Apparently even the Koss factory is capable of producing crap for an OEM job."
1697,2,"Works great for what it is. I was looking for a wireless remote to use from behind my camera, not in front of it.(My Bad)Since I do Scenic photography not Portrait and I don't photograph myself in them, I don't need to be in front of the camera."

Looking for a more robust version..."
1699,1,"I was going to buy a $125 Bose over-the-ear headset that can be tested at Target and Bestbuy but I decided to buy this one for about $50.  A little disappointed since the sound quality did not match the Bose but in hindsight I should not have expected a $50 headset to sound as good as a $125 headset.  The bass of the HD-212 is outstanding but the highs and mid level sounded closer to my white in-the-ear earphones that came with my ipod.  The earphones are comfortable and I do enjoy the deep bass but overall I can't rave about it.  For a $50 earphone, I got my money's worth.  Comparing it to my $35 Sony earphone, it does sound better because of the deep bass.  My final recommendation is to audition the $125 Bose earphone at Target or Bestbuy and decide if you can afford the extra $75.  Now that I heard both, I really wished I got the Bose."
1700,2,"I've had my Koss PortaPro headphones for about three months.  I read good things about them in my online research and was particularly interested in the fact that they were said to have excellent bass for portable headphones.  In fact they do, as part of an overall rich, nicely balanced sound. I also find them to be comfortable and convenient (they fold up into a small circle and fit into a handy pouch.)  They appear to be well made and I anticipate using them for a long time.I also bought a pair of the cheaper Koss PRO1 phones in a two-fer Amazon deal when I bought these, and they're excellent sounding portable phones as well.  The metal construction of the PortaPros likely give them an advantage in durability; the sound quality between the two is comparable.  If you're interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs, mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones (enough low end so that you won't need to use the annoying, sound-sucking bass boost found on most portable players), with good construction to boot, I highly recommend the PortaPros.  They'll definitely sound much better than the phones that come with most Walkman-style devices."
1701,0,"I had one that was still working, but thought it time for another one for a back up as I use it a lot, upon receiving it, I called my friend in Fl and said Hi, what do you think, she said huh? I can't hardly hear you, I checked to make sure it was turned on, than checked volume and yes it was up, so I moved it all the way down and then all the way back up and still had to speak very load to be heard, as for hearing her, it was not nearly as well as I could hear her on my old set, so I probably over rated this product, panasonic used to make good products but seems latley every thing I buy from them is not up to standards. If you want to yell while talking on this product then it is for you, I would not buy this product again."
1702,2,"I planned buying it for mounting my e-Trex Venture on my motorcycle. None of the reviews here could help me in getting rid of my worry: will it fit in my handlebar? I assumed it will, so I purchased it. The result? PERFECT FIT. Using the thick rubber strap I could securely attach the handlebar mount and the GPS clicked-in in a snap. Naturally there's a lot less vibration on a street/road motorbike handlebar than that on a mountain bike, so that would not be a problem for me. I was wrong, since I noticed several times GPS suddenly turned off while riding. So be careful 'cause battery lid can actually provoke false electric contacts from time to time, turning the GPS off. I got through this by placing a thin piece of foam over the batteries which made the lid to close tighter and solved the problem."
1703,0,"This product and the bundled Pinnacle 8 Studio software delivered spotty performance. It generally capptured the video from tape OK, but the interface (and especially the capture format options) was very non-intuitive. The DVD rendering was slow, and results were hit and miss: some were OK, some failed outright and some were rendered with annoying frequent color shifts (about every 3 seconds throughout the entire DVD). This all took place on a new, fast machine with plenty of RAM and disk space. I'm pretty comfortable with new apps, but the Studio 8 is very hard to figure out. Consider the PYRO A/V link from ADS instead."
1704,0,The sound isn't great but adequate for my purposes - using them at the gym. The headband and ear pieces do not fit especially well.

1706,2,"The 3400 is a very solid 2 megapixel camera, but so too is the 280. Sowhy spend at least 25% more on the 3400? In terms of features, itoffers almost nothing to recommend it. The fact is a camera in thisquality range should not cost this much. If you want an all-around 2meg digital, check out the 280; if you want a more limited (but stillvery functional) digital camera for mostly internet apps, look at the3200 (1/2 the price). If you want 35mm quality, controls and feel,look at the 4800 (twice the price)."
1707,0,"I compared it to my falling-apart cheap GE headset. The sound from this headset's microphone is nowhere near as good. I recorded two voice mail messages, one from the old headset and the other from this headset. The sound from this headset is muffled but the cheap falling-apart GE headset sound is great.I'm returning this one. However, I would appreciate any tips ond finding a replacement for the GE. I've tried several and the microphone sound is the same - muffled and inadequate for business calls. I've received complaints about every new headset of this type. Help.Maybe cheap headsets were better made five years ago. I'm at a loss."

1709,2,"I bought the Mouseman optical after reading lots of reviews. I am very pleased with it. I have tested it in unreal tournament and it works very well except for a few scroll wheel issues which can be fixed with a patch. I am one of the flick gamers and I found no problems with the mouse other then the scroll wheel. The only time the optical camera failed me was when I move it as fast as I can to test it, but you must move it faster then you will ever need to. To achieve the speed to fool the camera you must move so fast you cannot use the mouse for any operation. The mouse shape is very comfortable and fits my hand very well, better then the explorer. Although I like the scroll wheel of the microsoft mice because they feel better I would still go with this mouse because it is better and easier to grip.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the scroll wheel.  When scrolling in internet explorer I found there was a slight lag between I turned the wheel and when the page started scrolling and that the scroll was choppier then the MS mice"
1710,1,"I read the reviews on this card and bought it.  On my Nikon 995 it is NOTICEABLY slower than [other] cards.  In particular, the ""writing to card"" icon in the camera's monitor, which I never saw with the other cards, is always there after taking a picture with this card.I'm hoping that this is not a Terrible Thing, since I don't often take many pictures one right after the other, and the camera DOES have a memory buffer.  But instinctively I wish I had sprung for the extra [$] and gotten a faster card."
1711,0,The router is very reliable but the surfing is too slow when other clients are on the network. The range is also not good. I only get 3 or 4 bars on the meter and the router is only 20 feet away. Also the plastic case is warped. The 4 legs will not rest on the table at the same time. I have a version 6 router. I would avoid this and try a version 8 or a different model
1712,0,"1.  In my environment (urban) I received no listenable shortware channels at all.  Selectivity is nonexistant.2.  FM works fine...at the level of a $10 radio that is.3.  The sound is very, very tinny and having the radio level turned up causes distortion very rapidly.4.  There is a rather nice carrying case of the typical non-waterproof nylon variety.  I find it useless.Consider this *only* an *emergency radio*, without any other value at all."
1713,0,"As a computer tech, I recommended this to one of my clients, a regrettable decision.  The card itself works very well, but there is one key flaw with this card:--------------------------------------------------------------The antenna will break at the slightest bump, and there is no way of putting it back.--------------------------------------------------------------We took this thing back about 3 times, each time the same result, the card was put in, everything worked great, the computer was pushed back beneath the desk, and oops!  The antenna hit the wall/cord/something and it came off.  The antenna cannot be reatteched, so a replacement had to be obtained.Linksys needs to remedy this problem fast, likely by making a one piece antenna that is *sturdy*.  Computers do get bumped around, and the antenna falling off is the last thing you want to worry about.We have a second computer with this card in, and it works great, since we were 'extra' gentle with it.  Basically it means we can't move the computer due to the high chance of the antenna falling off.  I give this product 2 stars, because when the antenna is on, it works great.At the end, we resorted to getting the USB Linksys wireless adapter.  Even though it is slower at 802.11b, the unit is very sturdy (nice sturdy antenna) and took care of my client very well."
1714,0,"This headset worked fine for a few months. Sound was nice and loud and clear. But in less than four months it has begun to have a very loud and annoying hum, which is heard by both caller and receiver on the line. It has gotten so loud that I have to trash it and look for another headset. I would not recommend this headset."
1715,2,"This camera is just great !It's very easy to understand and use the controls. Inserting media and retreving it is also easy.Image quality straight out of the camera without tweeking is great and people that don't use Photoshop or don't know how end up getting great pictures hassle free.Battery consumption is very good and while we've had the camera for over a month and picture taking averaging 4 to 5 pictures a day, it's still working fine with the original set of alkalines we bought.I bought this camera as a gift for my 18 year old son and now he carries it everywhere, he loves it!"
1716,0,"I use a laptop at home...on my lap.  I've gone thru two of these units now.  The first unit lasted only about 2 weeks, but I'd lost the receipt so couldn't do anything about getting money back.  So I bought another, and it lasted about 4 months until it started to not really work well, and now (a total of 7 months into ownership) it finally died completely.  The concept is great.  The product is cheaply made and doesn't last as long as it should.  Computer stores sell this product for like $40...insane.Today I'm buying a different brand...we'll see."
1717,2,"Valentine's Day is my one chance per year to make up for all the stupid, lazy, thoughtless, horny, arrogant and unromantic things my wife has put up with since the last V-Day. My only hope to get out of the doghouse and back in the bunkhouse is to pull off a Grand Romantic Gesture that makes her forget the Neanderthal she lives with for 364 days in between.Also, I don't want to spend too much money. Some of that stupid, lazy, thoughtless stuff can get pretty expensive. So it's a real challenge.What's more romantic than the image of John Cusack with his boombox in 'Say Anything', playing sweet Peter Gabriel nothings to his sweetie? This sturdy, durable throwback casette-and-CD combo player was perfect for me to recreate the scene. I downloaded a copy of 'In Your Eyes' on MP3, burned it to CD, dubbed it over to a blank tape, and I was all set.Of course, my wife and I live in the same house, so I couldn't very well serenade her from the street. Plus, it's cold outside, and the neighbors already give me funny looks. So I decided to stand outside our bathroom door after her shower one morning. Me romantic, her naked -- perfect.Unfortunately, holding this oversized bulky monster over my head for four-plus minutes wasn't the best idea I've had. And all that re-re-recording of the song made it come out all muffled and tinny through the detachable speakers. One of which detached during the chorus and bonked me in the head. By the time the song was over, I was collapsed under the boombox in a heap on the floor, and my wife -- wrapped demurely in a towel -- cracked the bathroom door to ask:""Did you just say something? I had the blow dryer on.""So I'm still in the doghouse, and may have suffered the first Lloyd Dobler-related hernia on medical record. Outstanding."
1718,2,"What can one say about this simple, but much needed accessory??-KOSS VC20 volume control-best one I have ever used.Ever use an accessory rotary volume control (if you can find one)??They usually work for a week, get a speck of dust inside, then become choppy or silent!Most headphones are furnished with a rotary volume control,the better headsets, of course, usually have the better quality control.However the controls drop dead, just before the headphones do....I mow acres & acres of lawns all season long-lots of dust & pollen.I use the KOSS VC20 every day (going on two years)!!If it gets dirty, a tiny squirt of Deoxit-and it springs right back!!!Amazing durability from an $8.19 component!"

1721,2,"Unlike practically every point-and-shoot digital out today, this has a viewfinder. When taking photos outside, in sunlight, an LCD is essentially useless. Also, with the D490, I can turn off the LCD and conserve batteries. The D490 uses ordinary batteries that you can buy at any 7-11. The case closing to protect the lens in nice. The photos seem very sharp to me, even though this is only a 2.1 megapixel. The D490 seems to take photos with less delay than many of today's point-and-shoot digital cameras. On the down side, it's easy to forget to flip up the flash."
1722,0,"I bought this product because I read rave reviews about it.  However, it does not work in San Jose (and I live on a top floor).  After being able to pick up zero channels, I bought an RCA ANT401 (for the same price) and was able to get all the channels."
1723,0,"These are some of the better-sounding entry-level headphones I've sampled, with crisp treble, decent bass, and good all-around balance and tonal neutrality. And even though differences tend to be subtle among basic headphones, you can still tell this is an American product for American tastes: the sound is just a little punchier and more pleasing than, say, your average Sony or JVC (which sound flat to me).Unfortunately, ""American"" also applies to the build quality, as the left half of my set just DIED after only five months of gentle use -- a frequent occurrence judging by the comments around here. Worse, the ""Lifetime Limited Warranty"" is limited indeed, because Koss won't help out unless you mail in a $9 check. That's pretty ludicrous knowing it's THEIR product that failed, and dishonest since at that price, they're actually making a profit on your repair. At that point it's more rational to just buy a new one, which is probably the idea.Yeah I know, the price tag's tempting, but do a little math: over five years, is it smarter to spend $50 for even the most overpriced Sennheisers, or blow $150 on ten pairs of these?"
1724,2,"OK, in an attempt to find the ""perfect"" backpack, I ordered this one (LowePro Mini Trekker AW), the Tamrac Expedition 5 and the Kata R102.  I ran them through their paces and guess what I found?  None of them had everything I wanted.  That being said, I settled on the Lowepro.  Details below...BACKPACKS IN GENERALThe Bottom Line:Simply put, it seems that it's nearly impossible to find a backpack that combines comfort with capacity.  The Kata R102 was, by far, the most comfortable, study backpack of the 3 but was hands-down the ""smallest"" pack space-wise.  There was hardly any room for manuals (my D70 manual and SB600 flash manual bulged the one pocket) and very little storage for ""trinkets"" (it all fell loose).  The Lowepro and Tamrac packs had ample room, but were only semi-comfortable on my back compared to the Kata.  So I had to decide between capacity and comfort.  Since I really want a ""carry everything"" pack, the LowePro won out (being cheaper when compared to Tamrac and having a better ""fit"" on my back (6'4"")).THE LOWEPROThe Good:Of the three, only the LowePro was configured in a way that you could carry two ""ready"" cameras.  Of course all 3 would carry a second body and lens, but not ""assembled"".  The LowePro has room at the bottom for a second camera pointing toward the top of the pack.The LowePro has the best ""non-camera"" storage system, with a system of mini slots and pouches for things like PDAs, iPods, books, etc.  The Tamrac had this, but it was one big compartment where they would all jostle around.  The Kata's was non-existent (literally).The LowePro and Kata both have a true weather-proof cover but the LowePro stores it away in a built-in pouch in the bottom instead of taking up a ""lens slot"" (like the Kata, which is already space-limited).The LowePro is the cheapest of the three (always a plus)The Bad:Not much ""bad"" that I can see, aside from the fact that it's not THE most comfortable of the three, but it certainly beats out the Tamrac which was the least comfortable of the three (for me)The Ugly:Of the 3, the LowePro has, by far, the worst tripod carrying system.  Sure, the ""hideaway"" tripod puch is nice, but the supplied system of *elastic rope* is flimsy and seems to have been included as an after-thought.  The compression straps can be crossed and hooked to the ""wrong"" side as a fix, but one shouldn't need to ""fix"" anything at these prices...I decided on the Lowepro (as I said above) because I wanted a ""carry everything"" bag that would fit on my back.  What I get is a nice ""gadget bag"" that fits comfortably on my back for a run through the airport.  I do NOT have a backpack, however, that would work for a several-hour hike.  I have a pack that's good for the State Fair so I have what I need and my wife can fit a few things she picks up as well.  It will NOT be good for a day-trek through Paris.  Then again, if I'm hiking in the woods or sight-seeing through Paris, do I really want EVERYTHING camera-related on my back?  Probably not.  I'm more likely to carry a small sling/fanny-pack for the camera, a zoom lens and maybe a flash.When all was said and done, the LowePro struck the best balance of comfort and space.  Space management was best in the one and comfort was second only to the Kata (which I preferred most of the three but lost out because of severe space restrictions).Bottom line: You're not gonna be satisfied with what you get ;)  At this price range, none of the backpacks serve up everything (my Dad and brother, who are also amateur photogs agree).  The LowePro WILL, however, serve your immediate needs and save you a few bucks to investigate other options.  It's sturdy and wears well for short periods of time (maybe an hour or two tops) and will DEFINTELY carry everything you might for a two-camera system (assuming you can share secondary lenses between the two).Hope this helps!PS I have no clue why this pack is showing up as ""unavailable"" on Amazon at the moment.  Odd..."

1727,1,The product description was really poor on Amazon for this product. And it says that this zoom is compatible to Nikon SLR D3100. But it fails to specify that only manual focus is possible for all Nikon SLR. Fortunately the price is very reasonable. I don't mind to use manual focus after all. Additionally the quality of photos seems to be fine. But I will know more after few weeks. I would give 4 stars if bought this zoom by knowing there is no autofocus function for Nikon D3100.
1728,0,"I cut it easily enough for my 2.5"" Cybershot W50 screen, and at first I was happy with it (I will use the extra for my ipod).

It does come with 2 extra sheets, but I think I will do without."
1729,0,"We purchased for traveling between our summer and winter homes twice a year. Firstly we found that it had no range on the interstate. Wanted to get road reports and couldn't reach anyone further than a 1/2 mile away.......too late!  Secondly, it doesn't work anymore. It appears to have short or something. It has never been dropped or misused. It was working in the car one day and the next it would not. Very disappointed."
1730,1,"I bought a set after reading an Audiophile's anecdotal review. However, it became  apparent they are a couple of notches down on smooth frequency in the midrange, and tapered down graphically off in the high frequencies. After reading Headroom's empirical graphs , I discovered this was indeed the case . Most people buy headphones based on their bass response . These have a smooth but slightly exaggerated bass. A real and exceptional deal is still the old Sony MDR V6 or 7506. Based on real empirical evidence they are noticeably better and have reputation for endurance which trumps everything in a closed phone. They are slightly cheaper also. The  Sennheiser HD555 are noticeably better too, and have that wonderful spacious sound of &#34;open earphones."
1731,1,"This thing works just fine for what it does: provide a way to hook an mp3 player into a car cassette deck. The sound quality absolutely beats an FM transmitter.

Quality is great - no, amazing - for the price.Today, in the middle of a photo shoot, I was lowering the tripod, and as I did, the lens bumped the side of the table (not hit, not crash, just a slight bump) and the lens literally broke in half!!! The front lens rolled off the table and onto the floor, and the other half of the lens remained attached to the camera. A Google search revealed several other consumers with the same issue.I could not find a way to put it back together.Canon won't fix it after a year. They wanted $112 to fix it. No, thanks.I had to run out to a store that claims their buys are the best, and had to shell out another $125 for a new one. Not happy. Lenses are supposed to out last the camera. My dad is an avid photographer, and has had lenses that lasted through the 80's and 90's and they're still perfectly fine to use today."
1735,0,"I bought these because the reviews were pretty good, and as far as sound goes I would agree that they are a very good value for the low price.

I had seen reports of a poor design around where the wire enters the earpiece and I am not sure that is exactly what I had, but it was frustrating.  It only seemed to cut out as a result of my movement while doing cardio.  Now I can only use them while not moving around.  Given this problem, I would not buy them again.  And I am still looking for the right pair of clip-on earphones that will not keep falling our of my ear and will not break my pocketbook."
1736,0,I intend to replace them with some speakers that shound good quite soon.
1737,2,So far it works.  If it still does in a few years I'll be happy and I would recoomend it.
1738,0,"DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers, wired and wireless, attached to it. What's more, it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection, which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to 10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold. But the issue is not resolve.  Upgrading to new firmware (2.50)won't resolve the issue either. Furthermore, replacing the network card for a new one won't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing, calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face....go for it..."
1739,0,"Had it for 4 months and it was working fine. Always safely removed it. but after 4 months it stopped being recognized as Lexar Jumpdrive and when i tried to access it it said Drive not formatted. When i formatted it, it stuck halfway and said. unable to format drive. Maybe i got a bad stick {it happens sometimes} but then i checked it out and alot of people had the same problem. Bought a Kingston DataTraveller and Sandisk Cruzer Mini, had them for over 8 months and they're working perfectly."
1740,2,"I have an eTrex and was excited after recently purchasing a new road bike, to pick this up.  The unit fit on my handle bars without any problem after trimming the rubber mounts to size.Now that I have my eTrex mounted on my bike, I love using it!  I have it next to the Schwinn 17 function speedometer I have mounted.I only have 2 issues.First, the replacement battery cover does not fit any eTrex that can house a mini-sdcard.  I actually had to use my dremmel to cut away at the plastic where the card would mount.Once I did that, getting the battery case on with the ""metal twist"" lock was extremely difficult.  It was as if they made the metal lock about 2-3mm too short.  Eventually, after overcoming my frustration and fear of breaking the GPS unit from using the original sealed back, it clicked into place.  But, I did have to wrench it pretty hard.I probably wouldn't trust it to be water proof/tight anymore, but it's on my bike, not a boat or for use in the rain.If Garmin would make one to actually fit their GPS I'd be more than happy to purchase that one."
1741,2,"It's a Canon product, not much more to say about the quality. However, my 7D with EF-S 17-55 lens on barely fits into it. I would have to take the lens off each time, if both have to fit in comfortably. There is no room to store the flashlight unless I take the lens off. Even then it might be a squeeze. In near future, I may consider a larger bag."
1742,0,"I bought this hub (two of them, in fact), lured by the promise of High-Speed USB ports and the fact that it was &#34;powered.&#34; The only thing the plug adapter seems to power, however, is the light that tells you it's plugged in. The $5 cheap-o unit I had hoped to replace did a better job of maintaining connection with external drives (which constantly spin down/ramp up using this unit), and even my Wacom tablet refuses to connect through these overpriced pieces of Dlink.  No smart phone -- from the iPhone 3GS to an ancient Android -- can be charged with this unit, and many devices just plain don't seem to connect at all (and those that do don't stay connected for long).Extremely disappointed."
1743,0,"The video shows that you can use the camera a side, but you need an adapter to do this. Thanks."
1744,2,"Nice case, fits the unit well. I have used it 3 times and clips to the belt nicely, with the unit coming out and in with now problems. Off the the belt as well, it provides good protection."
1745,2,"The above reviews sum it up well- I have a 500D body, 18-35mm lens, 75-300mm lens, macro filters, and a remote for the camera. It fits just so, and it's definitely NOT a 'grab something out real quick' or 'throw everything back in and run' kind of bag. However, other than that, this thing is solid- it is not made cheaply, which is great. The zippers and latches are all metal, not plastic. The pouch up front fits a spare battery and all my charging cables."
1746,0,"These may have needed thousands of watts & studio panel to appreciate,,, or they're just not that good.. I couldn't tell, so returned em. I couldn't get them comfortable or to sound loud & full, they seemed quiet & subdued, no matter what I played. Whereas a 15.00 pair of wicked 'phones were light, cushy, deep bass & full tone, with an extension cable, gold-plated connections, etc.. i don't see the need for these at all."
1747,1,"The string is very short, and I don't think the connector will last long. It also makes the cap hit the lens quite a lot due to its shortness."
1748,2,"Using any computer that has a GUI with carpel tunnel is a miserable experience.  Ive spent 3 years trying to find an input device, and have a large collection if USB and Bluetooth mice.  I decided to change my point of view in my search and started to look at trackballs.The great thing with this model is that I can leave my extra large hand in one place on the unit, the ball fits idealy under my thumb, fingers hit on the buttons and wrist can stay in a straight, comfortable allignment.My only complaint is that the cordless range gets really short when the battery starts to die, which has been every 3-4 weeks.  The signal wont pass through any books on my desk.  Also, the base has a long cord which makes portable laptop use a pain.  I have ordered two of the older, corded models which should resolve those problems.I was a little afraid of Logitech, after owning their first and second generation mice which I found lacking in ergonomics and also in longevity, but after a year now this is in the 'almost as great as pre-sliced bread' category.If you like to use trackballs with your thumb, this is the one."
1749,2,Lots of compartments. Big enough for a 40D and seveal lenses plus manuals and other trinkets. Quality constructon. Rugged. Was a toss-up between a backpack and this bag... Still thinking about the backpack.
1750,0,"I bought two of these to replace my slower Belkin hubs, but discovered that this product is not reliable. True, I have a lot of USB devices, but these hubs are supposed to handle seven devices at a time, and they don't. I have braille devices and it is crucial that they work, especially my braille display; but it has quit working for no reason, and my CD burner has also. And the hubs don't work with some devices, especially my book port which is another adaptive technology device used by blind people. I'm back to my trusty, but slower, Belkin."
1751,0,"Like many other reviewers, these headphones did not fit my ears well.  They flopped around if I moved and were not ""non-slip"" as the name states.  I had to return them due to the improper fit."
1752,1,"I finally got this to work on my wireless network. My entire network is Linksys and until I bought this server I had been mighty impressed with the easy set up of most Linksys products. Not so here. I'm a professional network analyst and I still had major hassles getting this thing to work. It finally does, albeit without WEP. After all the hassles so far just to get it working, I'm not sure if I want to risk messing it up by setting up WEP. Beginners or non-experts should look elsewhere."
1753,0,"Pull the router out of the box; plug in the network cable between my laptop and the router; supply the network SSID, ISP IP information, WEP key, and IP range for DHCP.  Unplug router from laptop, plug router into DSL &quot;modem&quot;, slip wireless card into laptop.Network connection says the wireless connection is excellent, but the IP address it gave me is 0.0.0.0, so that's not right.  Try a few more times with &quot;ipconfig release/renew, &quot;repair connection&quot;, pulling and reinserting the card, still nada.Restore old wireless router (Apple Airport), browse over to netgear.com, get the latest firmware (5.03), install on new router, put new router back in network.Network connection says the wireless connection is excellent, and the IP address is right!  &quot;yay&quot;  But wait, now it's gone! &quot;boo&quot;  Now it's back! &quot;yay&quot;  Now it's gone! &quot;boo&quot;.  Move laptop next to wireless router and the connection stabilizes but it takes 5-10 seconds to get to each admin page.  Local throughput on a file copy approached 50kb/sec for at least 30 seconds.  Web connections are hopeless.  Manual says to try a different channel.  Still awful.  Manual says to disable WEP.  Still awful.Send email to tech support with details of problems including the fact that I upgraded to 5.03.  They tell me to upgrade the firmware to 5.03.  I am getting a little upset and tell them I have already upgraded the firmware.  They give up and send me to phone support.  I call Netgear and explain my problems including the frustrating experience with email support.  Phone support tells me to upgrade the firmware to 5.03.  I sigh quietly and explain (one more time) that I have already upgraded the firmware.  Phone support sounds puzzled by this.  Phone support puts me on hold, and later tells me to change channels, I do so with no effect.  Phone support seems baffled, I ask if it could be that the product doesn't actually function as advertised?I give up on phone support and send the Netgear MR814v2 back to Amazon for a refund."
1754,2,"I've been auditioning the replacement to my hockey puck for some time. I first tried Logitech's Trackman Optical with the thumb trackball. That worked great except for a couple things.  For simple Internet use it was great, but I'm a graphic artist, and I need something I can draw and trace around things with, and the marble wasn't cutting it with my naturally nervous hands. Drawing in Macromedia Freehand with it was a nightmare. So, since it didn't meet my needs 100%, I took it back and found this one. It's basic, and there's nothing wrong with basic for those of us who like simplicity. I got the blue one (it comes also in red), which goes really well with my purple computer. I have two buttons now; the right one I programmed for doubleclick. Makes me feel like a real PC person. (Ha!) Speaking of which, it comes with a green adapter for a Windows device I will never use, so I've got a spare if anyone wants one. One should be warned never to pick the mouse up and stare at its underside, because that's a laser beam. The mouse glows red every time you put your hand on it. Best feature is the scroll wheel. However, I've found that there's a bug of some kind with my Netscape 6.2.3 when you push on it. Using it for a back button calls up a new blank window...not much help, so do it the old-fashioned way. Also, I've noticed it crashes the computer on occasion, not sure why. One less star for that. The mouse will point and click without the Mouseware software, but if you install it, you can program the mouse and scroll. It's also the same software you get with the Trackman, so no need to reload for it. All in all, it's a vast improvement over the mouse I've been using for three years, and I'm not a gamer so I don't need it to have bells and whistles. Now, if I could just find a bigger keyboard with USB ports and a power button that doesn't cost an arm and a leg!"
1755,2,Just exactly what I was looking for. Satellite box audio output was un-adjustable and very loud. This fixed the problem.
1756,0,"I bought this printer because the product description emphasized the low cost per page for printing, supposedly better than with other printers.  And because I associate the name Kodak with pictures from my film days, I thought it might be better for printing photos.  That was not the case.  I kept this printer for almost a year but I finally became fed up and got rid of it.  It worked fine, the scanning was fine and the software for editing pictures etc. was fine.  I did not bother to print many photos because I found I was constantly replacing ink cartridges.  I was buying ink far more frequently than with my HP printer that this one replaced, I believe I probably spent twice as much on ink for the Kodak."
1757,0,"This thing is uncomfortable, has a so so microphone, can be a little quiet and I would never buy it again on purpose. The only thing good about it is it is a 2.5 MM jack so it fits the tiny jack on the excellent Panasonic cordless phone. If only this thing has Bluetooth or a regular 3.5 MM headphone jack.You only buy this thing if you have to and I think Panasonic knew that when they designed it."
1758,2,"You notice more sounds with these headphones.  This is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat, especially at this price."
1759,2,"I got a pair of sportapros, KSC75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver. And to be fair, I was confused. Each headset has it's own distinct feature and advantage. Very frankly speaking, the portapro's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype, since frankly speaking I do not see the 50% increase in any way.That being said, the portapros do sound the best of the lot, because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage. I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers, hence kind of ""closing"" it up a bit. The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two, but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out, hence the huge drop in bass. Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you'll get what I mean.Comfortwise, I would say the KSC75s win by a mile. You won't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on. The pads are good, comfy, and the same for all the three, but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd. The KSC75s look uglier. Love the design idea of the sportapro though, the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius, and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it. The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch, in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in. the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4"" adapter as well. Packaging wise, portapro is miles aahead of the rest (well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros!!). The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack, but then again it's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s, which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it, make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.The KSC75s are the best bang for the buck definitely. But again, even the most expensive PortaPro is less than half the price of it's closest competitor from another company.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on."
1760,2,good for the purpose intended and is very well built.
1761,0,"I was very hopeful that the negative reviews I read about this product were due to operator error, but unfortunately they were not.  Although I could get them to work, they were very intermittent and touchy.I called the company that makes them and they did warn me that you have to keep them away from metal objects, sunlight or florescent lights.  That could have been part of my problem since I located it next to a recliner on an end table near a lamp with an energy saving florescent bulb.  Unfortunately, since it had to be plugged into an electrical outlet, it was the only place I could locate it.I returned this item and purchased the One-For-All URC-9910 RF/IR remote for not much more.  I put the RF unit in the exact same place that I had the Leap Frog unit and it works 100x's better.  No more worrying about pointing the remote directly at the RF unit.One thing about the URC-9910 combo is that the RF unit only works with the remote that comes with it.  Not really a negative, since it has learning capability and I was able to replace the 4 original remotes that I had been using."
1762,0,"For the most part - I am disappointed with this product.  For years I've purchased the generic Radio Shack adapters- but found the price of Sony adapter appealing.  Most times after popping it in my cassette deck- it shoots back out and my stereo screen displays ""Error"" (This could be do the cold weather climate I live in- but the Radio Shack adapter was never this bad).  Additionally, the sound quality is not as good as Radio Shack's (it's not bad- but it could be better)."
1763,0,"This is my second Sony Trinitron. Now this one has fallen to the ""Sony kiss of death.""  It keeps turning off and will not restart. It will run from a cold start for about 4-5 minutes and then die. I have gotten repair estimates of $200 -$300. for a 'possible' repair. This is a common problem with a poorly designed power supply that overheats. Sony truly built a defectively designed TV. I am finished with Sony. It is all baloney."
1764,1,"This was one of the worst, yet best ideas Palm made.The screen is smaller than any other Palm, yet it was in color.  Also, there were noted problems with recharging.  (My wife went through two m130s, that had problems with recharging/losing charge.  I ended up getting her the m515 (with no problems).)The idea was great because it appeals to the young generation, with interchangeable face plates.Giving it the memory expandability was great, for a little more you could get the m5xx series.Don't waste you money on any m1xx series.  If you want an inexpensive Palm go with:Monochrome = Palm Zire/Zire 21Color = Palm Zire 71 or Tungsten E"
1765,2,They do a good job. I put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years. Great sound. I would buy them again. Great bargain for the price.
1766,2,"These are amazing little locks. I bought 3 of these to help deter people from taking my computers. These will not prevent someone that is motivated to steal it, but it will help to prevent someone from just picking it up and walking away with it when you are not looking."
1767,0,power button got stuck and had to return it for a refund.  prior to that I liked it just fine
1768,0,"Seized my windows XP machine, disabled almost all of my other USB input devices and now puts me in an endless loop of files not found for uninstall. I can't get it off my machine!!!!! Software tries to load all this other crap on your system. The mouse might be nice but my suggestion is that all of the logitech programmers go back to programmers school."
1769,2,"great bag, lives up to lowepro's rep but simply too small for a d300 w/grip. the camera with no grip and a 30mm prime just barely fit. no way would it take a longer zoom. adding insult to injury, no room for a flash in the acc. pocket. mine is going back. would be a great solution for someone with a smaller camera, though."
1770,2,"The Canon Remote Switch R560 E3 works great. The cord is a bit short....I think its maybe 2 ft. I would have liked to see it come with a 36"" cord."
1771,0,"The JVC GR-DV800U is a lot of camera for a modest amount of money, but, as other reviewers have pointed out, it suffers in poor lighting conditions as do many other camcorders. I'm giving it two stars because 1) JVC tech support personnel are a bit numb and less than helpful; and 2) although the product is advertised as being compatible with OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 (Firewire) inputs, it will only work with Pinnacle, Belkin and Orange Micro Firewire PCI boards. Otherwise you can't transfer it to your computer. So you may have to cough up a PCI slot and another $45 to make it work. (I have an onboard Asus IEEE 1394 and a separate PCI Texas Instruments OHCI compliant board and neither would accept and install the camera connection. My wife's computer wouldn't take it, either, getting us only a big yellow question mark in Device Manager in Windows XP.JVC is a bit dishonest in its claims to be compatible with OHCI-compliant connections, but the camera's good and (best part) it has a MIC IN jack, which is the main reason I bought it."
1772,1,"Great brand, great price but headphones did not last thy broke after 6 months.  I would buy again but no these"
1773,0,This is not what I was looking for I was looking for only that only had audio not audio and Mic
1774,0,"I don't know why these types of cards are still on the market--they are old, slow, and obsolete. Instead, search for 32-bit Cardbus adapters such as the ones made by Viking, Delkin, or Lexar, which are many times faster but not much more expensive.  And, they fit in the same PC card slot on most laptops made in the last decade. The 32-bit cards I have used are even a bit faster than USB 2.0 and Firewire.You can spot 32-bit cards by the gold strip at the top of the card. No gold strip? Then prepare to wait an hour or more for your data to transfer, while your laptop is brought to its knees. The old silver cards may be fine for storing and playing mp3s, or may be needed for laptops made more than 10 years ago, but any large amount of data--such as GBs of photos or video-- will take quite a while to copy over. Why would you want a reader that is SLOWER than your flash media?"
1775,1,"Well after being a hard-core zenith fan for many many years I decided to go with this machine when my old Zenith VCR ate a tape after 15 years and a few quirky ejections.This one seemed like a good choice, ...the few problems I did have were caused by those annoying people putting thier grubby dirty fingers on the DVDs at Blockbuster that messed up the player reading them.  after a quick rub on the DVD it worked fine.The remote is a bit small for peopel with big fingers, but not impossible to use.My biggest qualm with it?  The buttons on the front are very hard to read and see which button you are pushing.  This is due to the reflective backing the buttons are set through.  If you have this unit set low and in a dark spot you can pretty much forget seeing what you are pushing, best choice is to the use the remote.I can't testify to the programing of this unit since I've trying to figure out how to get the best picture throgh a cable box comming from a new HDTV and all the other boxes and cables, I haven't had time to bother trying to record something.If I had the chance to buy it again? I think I would pass and go for something a progressive scan capability.  I would consider a Zenith in that yes, but this no.  Especially since I saw how going from the RCA connection to the S-Video improved the quality.  Maybe using the component output would kick it up to change my mind, maybe not."
1776,1,"This is a great keyboard, but has one major flaw.  The letters/symbols on the keys wear off quickly.  It is available in (unfashionable) white too, and the white keys do not have this problem.  It does take a while to get used to a &#34;natural&#34; keyboard, but once you do, it is so much better than the usual stuff.  One downside is, it will make it difficult for you to use a standard keyboard when you are away from your own computer."
1777,2,I bought this to use with an EOS Rebel XSi and it does exactly what it should do.  I've always successfully used it to take some really nice astronomy and wildlife shots.  It's a must for tripod and telephoto shots.  The switch attaches quickly and is easy to use.This is a necessary accessory and is always in the bag and goes with me whenever I travel with the camera and tripod.
1778,1,haven't used any of it thought would need for speakers but didn't will save for some other time and I am sure the wire will work
1779,2,"This radio is a classic choice for off-roaders because it's simple and works great!  Don't expect a tuckload of features with this unit - you get automatic noise limiter, squelch control, volume, and channel-changing knobs (that's it!).  Unless you're driving a big-rig, you're not going to need a more expensive radio (CB effectiveness is based more on your antenna setup and proper tuning than the radio itself).NOTE: If you want a public address (PA) option, go for the PRO520.  It's the same unit as this, except with PA."
1780,1,"This item is a wonderful tool to organize my life.  I can't function without it, I like it so much. Precisely why I had to give it a 3 star rating. It can't seem to hold a charge reliably.  When the battery reads nearly full one minute, an hour later I have lost all power and data, necessitating a hard reset. Palm will not stand behind this defect, because it was an &quot;open box item.&quot; They will sell me a new model for over $200, but the m515 is not available except as &quot;refurbished.&quot; I don't dare go that route again and recommend that others not buy open box items. They claim to have been thoroughly checked before resale, but I believe either my switch or my battery is defective. Because I like the model so well I am still trying to locate a &quot;new&quot; one on other websites that might be affordable.Advice: Buy new and back up often on hotsynch.Don't rely on Palm."
1781,2,I love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones I use.  Also the cord is long enough to work as an extension. I've always enjoyed Koss products; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most-- especially for the price.
1782,0,"Used this for two years with D40x, D60 and D3000, biggest complaint is that you must be in front of and close to the camera, within 3-4 feet.  Just got the Opteka version which is twice the size which makes it easier to operate for me, has far better range and will work from behind the camera.Opteka RC-2 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40, D40x, D50, D60, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D3000, & D5000 Digital SLR Camera (Nikon ML-L3 Replacement)"
1783,0,"Very good quality strap and comfortable, but never got to experience it. The attachment loops are too thick to wangle through the shallow recessed camera bracket. Even the gorilla I hired couldn't get it! Tech support with OP/TECH was kind and sent &#34;split rings&#34; to adapt the strap, but they were impossible to install (bracket too recessed), and their suggested adapters cost almost $7.00 more. I ordered down to their binoc strap which has a fastener of 3/8&#34;, the same width as the very flimsy Canon strap provided with my camera."
1784,1,"My new polk audio subwoofer has a very low hum when plugged in and not in use. I bought the MP SW 200 WITH CLEAN POWER STAGE to eliminate this hum without paying up for a larger surge protector which i didn't need. However, the hum still exists. Boooo!On the bright side, the surge protector appears to be in functioning condition, so hopefully it will protect my sub."
1785,0,"I changed most of my outlets to the modern decora type, Lowes Aspire.Screw feature is worthless for these outlets.I planned on using these on the old fashioned outlets that I left in.  I figured they would cover the plate, and I wouldn't need to update those plugs.  Wrong.  The plug in feature is near the very top of the Belkin.  That means they leave a prominent part of the upper part of the old ivory plate showing.  Remove the plate, and you have unfinished drywall showing  (the cutout). You wouldn't know that by looking at the given size specs for the Belkin.  Why don't these cover the entire plate?I opened one package, and will return the other three."
1786,0,"I bought the iPod from Amazon and it was delivered about a week ago. I also bought the Apple Care Protection plan. The product seems to work fine except I am having minor but irksom problems 'navigating' using the buttons and wheel thing. I am using it for an Audible book which is supposed to start where you left off. Well, after 7 hours it decided to start at beginning again. I try fast forward and the thing goes to the next book.  I want to just finish the last hour of the one that is being played.So, I call what they call Customer Service and find that they won't give me any advice whatever until I FAX in a copy of my shipping document from Amazon and another sheet with a magic number on it from within the extended service package. They say that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that they cannot check my order and date of sale from Amazon.I explain that I do not have a FAX machine, and that I will go send the stuff in a few days when I feel like walking that far using my crutches.I think that it is probably a good product, but if you are in any way handicapped and it is not convenient for you to run around to get their service, I recommend not buying it."
1787,0,"I bought this lens about 2 years ago with my 50D.  First thing I noticed was the lens creep - the lens slides out VERY easily if held at any downward angle, very annoying.  The worst part is, after very little use, but just out of the warranty period, the auto-focus stopped working!!  Google it, these two issues are incredibly common.  None of the suggested fixes worked for me and Canon wants $150 just to look at it!  Canon ought to be ashamed for producing such junk and then not repairing their mistake.  Very disappointed."
1788,0,"8 bucks for this? OK, I was desperate and leaving the country for a month and did not have time to go to Radio Shack. I thought it must be a particularly good one for this price. But the cost to produce this must be about 6 cents, if that. Should be a &#34;pack of 3&#34; for 5 bucks item, not one flimsy cover for 8 bucks. I feel genuinely ripped off."
1789,0,From all the great reviews I was so excited to receive these in the mail. Having an older pair of over the ear headphones I was expecting a major improvement. The headphones are of great quality in construction and looks. They do stay in the ear well whilst running. For me they really fell short in the most important sound department. They are distinctly tinny in their sound reproduction. I had to turn the bass way up to get an acceptable sound overall sound. I hope they loosen up as I use them more but I may be going back to my old pair. These were a disappointment for me.
1790,0,"I was wanting headphones that would not fall off during exercise.  I have never had much luck with earbuds, so I found these and thought they would stay put.  I was about 25 feet into a moderate paced run when they fell out.  The problem is they aren't adjustable and don't fit snug to your ears...and the cord is waaaaaayyyy too short too.  Garbage."
1791,0,Connected my original iPhone cable to this in order to extend its reach while my phone charged and it did not work. DO NOT BUY
1792,2,This product is basically a good one. My only complaint was that the clear plastic that you look through to see the unit often fogged up in wet weather.
1793,0,"Most likely these will serve you well (I paid a pittance in addition to no postage costs) in most ""conventional"" applications.  Unfortunately, my applications are apparently no more conventional than their possessor.  I want a 3.5mm audio out from, for example, a Mac Air computer, from an I-Dog, from a pocket-sized iPod speaker, and none of these cables can hack it because the casing--the plastic ""wrapping"" at the base of the plug--widens too far to allow the plug complete and full access to the jack on the device serving as your sound source.All you can do is keep ordering more cables with 3.5mm plugs until you land one that's small enough to fit snugly in tight places. Since they're too inexpensive to bother returning, you're likely to accumulate a mile's worth of gratuitous cables before obtaining one that fits.  At least the Scorsche retractable cable will fit into a few of the devices that are averse to most 3.5mm cables."
1794,0,This thing was quite for the first couple of days and now its pretty loud...to the point where I cant handle the noise.Waste of money on this fan.Its not vibrating off the usb outlet...the actual fan is loud. If you put some pressure on it it then quiets down.
1795,0,"I bought these at best buys and what a waste of money. After I just opened it and started to write on the discs, all the pens did not write clear and some were dryed out. Only the red worked fine but the rest smudged all over the disc like it was a paint brush. Save yourself from a headache, don't buy these markers."
1796,2,I purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord.  Being able to adjust the volume is an added bonus.
1797,1,"I bought this thing besides all the negative feedback.  For 20$ its much less than the 120$ driveway alarms.  the volume is a non issue;  If its too loud, put a piece of tape on it.  the false alarms can be 99% eliminated and fix the real issue--moisture!!  Put the sensor in a 10$ cedar bird house;  This keeps it from getting wet and keeps false alarms low.  And it hides it from people that would take and disable it.  Small animals and windy days can increase the false alarms.  okay for 20$, plus 10$ for the bird house (from Lowe's) and 2 cents in tape make a great buy.  The range is not 400ft more like 300ft and only one door."
1798,0,These tapes used to work OK for me.Not now.  Almost every one of them I used this summer had one or more timecode breaks / dropouts when using in my Canon XH-A1 camera.  (All the tapes were brand-new and not being re-used.)I film lots of live events and can't have even one frame missing from my footage!  I'll be switching to a higher-end tape today.
1799,1,"It's a clever design but i wouldn't put it in my pocket. I have a pocket monopod that also works as a steadicam. It's called a readysteady, and it really does fit in your pocket."
1800,2,"I didn't think I'd want this on my camera strap but it fit so well and is so unobtrusive that I left it on once I'd tried it.  Having it right there makes it incredibly convenient.Good for tripod work, though you have to reach around the front of the XTi because that's where the sensor is.  The 2-second delay mode is great for long exposures, as it locks the lens up and eliminates that shake.I wish the buttons were a little bigger, to permit use with gloves.  I also wish the instructions were a little easier to read.  It's one sheet with 10 different languages in tiny print and are a little vague in spots."
1801,0,"Nicely boxed and well-constructed but it wouldn't function in my network because it won't pass-through DHCP requests. This causes devices to use APIPA (Automatic Private Internet Protocol Addressing) which ends up being on a different sub-net and unreachable.My network is nothing special. It goes from cable modem to Ooma (VOIP) to Apple Extreme (DHCP server) to this switch. My ten-year-old Asante worked like this and when it failed, I replaced it with the GS108. Suddenly nothing in the switch worked. When I plugged my Mac into the switch I noticed it had a self-assigned IP address on a different subnet.I didn't bother contacting Netgear because I know their support is marginal. You can search their website and find many buyers asking about the same problem and all were responded to like it was their fault and their network setup was wrong.Something interesting I noticed is that most 8-port switches I looked at in this price range looked similar. In fact, many of them even had the same model number GS108 so I concluded they're all made by the same company and would have the same problem. So I spent a little more money and bought an HP switch with PoE.A couple more things I noticed which aren't important but indicates old technology. Who needs a 10MB LED? Most connections are 1000MB although I have a couple of old devices that are 100MB but on this unit there's not Gigabit LED. You have to look for a 10 and 100 and do the math. Ever hear of a multi-color LED? Also, there's no PoE provision built-in."
1802,0,"I had an old black pair of KOSS headphones that I loved.  The sound was clear, distinct, and true to the recording.  And they weren't some ultra-fancy expensive pro set, just something you'd find at Wal-Mart, etc.  I prolonged that set's life for as long as I could, but eventually they fell apart beyond repair.Upon seeking out a proper replacement, I thought why not go with the same brand?  Whatever equivalent product they have out now could only have improved over the years, right?  But no, I guess it's true what they say, ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""I got this pair in January '07.  I'm still using them reluctantly today.  I guess I can't say they're terrible, but what a drop in quality.  My old KOSS were extremely light and comfortable and fit well.  This new set really starts to hurt my earlobes after 20 minutes or so.  The sound is pretty muddy; especially the bass which is needlessly overdriven, making most songs just sound unbalanced.  They just feel cheap on the whole."
1803,0,This is great if all of electrical devices you are connecting to it are lamps or some other device with a similarly narrow plug. This is supposed to be a 7 outlet surge protector yet the outlets are so cramped together that I can only use 4 outlets.
1804,2,"These are great ear buds. If you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears, they expand and fit to your ears. Helps to block outside noises, and makes them comfortable. They feel secure and don't fall out if I'm moving around. Great for people who like to walk around with an ipod. Great bass, which is really important to me."
1805,1,"These are my first Sennheiser Headphones.  I purchased them based upon the glowing reviews for their sound.  I just also bought a pair of Sony 7506 headphones at about the same price range.  The Sony's blow these out of the water.  The 7506's have deeper bass, better imaging, extended treble, and are more sensitive.  They also seem to mate better with my Yamaha receiver for impedance purposes.The Sennheiser HD-280's will give you better sound than less expensive headphones, but both the Sony 7506 and V700DJ models are overall better in sound, sensitivity, power handling, and distortion."
1806,2,"Nice product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Quality is great, but it does not have any type of pause button on it.  It is strictly a volume control only."
1807,0,"When Washington state banned cell phone use while driving, I invested in several headsets. Listeners agreed that this was the clearest of the lost, so I settled on using it. And a month later, they reported that the sound quality had degraded to the point of unintelligibility. Lots of clicks and other background noise. So my search continues."
1808,0,"I should have never ordered this item. Should have read the negative reviews first. Save yourself the $2.40. Got this thing and the first day it breaks. My speaker fell off my desktop and the plug broke right off like it was nothing. Not worth the metal its made with. Don't order it. I decided to take the loss of my $2.40 since I'd rather not deal with customer service, even if I could get a refund."
1809,2,"I have had these headphones for 7 years, and the headphones are great.  But more than that, KOSS is amazing.  If there is a short, a problem (and there have been about 4 over the years), they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones, and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling.  I recommend any KOSS headphones not just because the sound is really good, but because they stand behind their product."
1810,2,"I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price"
1811,0,"I set the wireless router up according to the instructions in order to add a notebook computer to my AOL account.  Worked like a champ for about 48 hours.  Then, certain web sites would no longer load on my desktop that is connected to the router via ethernet cable (particularly web sites that require a log in).  After another 48 hours or so, I could not access the web at all.  I had to reboot the router and reload the software, and the whole process repeated itself.  I have no idea what the problem is."
1812,0,I noticed no difference with this card as oppose to Linksys or Netgear 11Mbps wireless card.
1813,2,"This Koss Model received overall very good reviews.  I can understand why, they sound full, open  and music sounds great.  Also comfortable, although I have not worn them for an extended time.  I would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth.  Others may have a difficult time hearing you.  Very please!"
1814,2,"I have a Koss Pro/4 A Plus headset that delivers incredible sound reproduction, but doesn't have an inline volume control.  I was considering ordering another headset with inline volume control, but was reluctant to do so because of the quality of my current Pro/4's.  Searched on Amazon and found this Koss VC20 volume control which is the perfect companion to my headset.As one of the other reviewers rightly stated, this device in not an amplifier.  Therefore please note the following:  one has to turn up the sound on the output device (an iMac in my case), connect the VC 20 volume control to this device, connect the headset to the the VC 20 and then adjust the sound to one's liking.  Very simple to do.  This makes for a superb listening experience.  Works on a computer, iPad, iPhone, etc., and can be used if jogging, exercising or just walking.I've been a fan of Koss for years because of the quality of their products.  This volume control carries on their commitment of making quality products.  Very pleased..."
1815,0,"My screen turns yellow on a regular basis, I guess this was a faulty unit.When I get a chance I will probably send it back, in the meantime I have invested in a raritran switchman KVM switch, a much better value for money proposition."
1816,2,"I want to like these headphones.  I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews.  Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the ""burn-in"" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting ""burnt-in"" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to ""All I've Gotta Do"" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).  WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff.  So many thanks to them for so far great customer service.  I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11.  Quick service from A1 Accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better.  Now I can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable (and channels are no longer switched).  I am finding that the Firm - Light settings are very touchy.  They don't want to stay on the ""Light"" setting easily but that is a minor problem.  I am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this."
1817,2,"I couldn't use it (D80 + 18-200mm VR), but it's pretty effective and minimalist, as I'd like, and would be ideal with some of the kit lenses on a Nikon D40/50/80."
1818,0,"You might notice that the newer reviews are harsher than the older ones. I just purchased this from Circuit City and it does not work. I tried a variety of rooms, remotes and configurations and only time it worked was then the remote was less than 6 inches from the sender unit.As a side note...I have tried to write this review on CC's website and I keep getting an error message...yet the ratings on CC's website are very high- shady."
1819,0,"The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.Invest in batteries rather than this product."
1820,2,The ear buds make nice ear plugs.  I wear them at work to block out noise. Sound quality is good but not the best.  They came with 3 different sized buds.  I think they are a good value for the price.
1821,2,"I really don.t care for CB's but I do drive a lot and this one has saved me a lot of time and money.  Hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash.  Easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble, I highly recommend this to anyone needing a CB"
1822,0,Warning:  I was about to buy this AC adapter for my grundig G-2000A radio.  I thought I would check eBay first.  The one listing on eBay had a better picture and it was clear from the diagram printed on the unit that the polarity is reversed.  This will not work with my radio and Amazon says it will.
1823,2,"my only gripe is this; i bought this remote to take pictures without having to touch the shutter button (to avoid camera shake)the remote only works if it is pointed at the sensor in the front of the camera. you could be less than an inch from the sensor, but if it is not facing the front of the camera, it wont take.  i know i could have bought one of the corded remotes, but i like to use the remote for taking family pics too(i dont have to run to get in place every time)it's not a big deal, it still works great."
1824,1,"Worked fine for about 4 months than just stopped working, was using it so I would know when my mom was trying to get up so I could help her"
1825,1,for the price this tripod is o.k. it is a bit unstable when fully extended. could have gotten it on e-bay for half the price.
1826,1,"Nice design and layout, but its too big for the PDA user.  You're better off with a steel business card holder or plastic Pelican cases that are water tight and shock resistant, alas they don't have those nice cubby holes."
1827,2,Weighs in at only 1kg. Nice quality construction.  Infinitely adjustable leg length.  I combined with with a Gorillapod with ball-head and bubble level. The ball-head is transferrable so I can use it on this Velbon as well.
1828,0,"This is in response to the NETGEAR 5-PORT (GS105E)(Edit/update (12/12/2013): Spelling errors)Does the job once it's setup.

1829,2,"Definitely worth getting. Comes in handy when you can't control the volume what you're listening to, as you would expect."
1830,2,"I was somewhat hesitant about ordering this but after using it for a few weeks I like it.  I would rather have something that fits into the camera body instead of mounting on the camera shoe.  I have not had any problems with it so far.  I also think like other Canon products, the price is a little steep."
1831,0,The most flimsy camera Nikon has ever made with a very bad lens. Junk. Most used Nikon film cameras are much better than this.
1832,2,"Over three years old now and still work like a champ....SOLID. CHEAP. SOUND GOOD.I have owned these about a year now.-Well Made-Good frequency response-comfortable-fair price for quality-allow external sounds to be heard (this is good for me, but maybe bad for others)-lifetime warranty with registrationI have a pair of Bose triport headphones, ultimate ears stuido3's, and Shure e2c.  I pick up the portapros every single time by preference.The in-ear type block out other noises if you want that, but for me this is one of the nice features of the portapro.  I can turn the music on medium and still hear if somebody is driving up behind me, trying to talk to me or trying to kicking down my door.  If I set the music low I liken it to having a conversation with somebody and the music is in the background.  As somebody that is very critical of everything I buy, I can say these exceeded my expectations.I thought I would like the in-ear type, but they are uncomfortable and if the seal in your ear canal is not perfect they have very poor frequency response.If you are looking for a nice pair of affordable headphones quit looking and buy portapros.  Once you get them go to Koss' website and register them for a lifetime warranty.  Bam... you are set with great phones for a long time."
1833,0,"I cannot upload any video from the camera (a powershot A610) to computer. I can only infer that this is a card problem since I've tried uploading into other computers and have no luck, and also the photos upload fine, just not the video. I've even tried to browse the card by folder instead of using Window's photo uploading tool, still does not work. Anyone else have the same problem?"
1834,2,after reading most customer reviews and a few technical reviews on portable headphones the two names with the most positive comments were koss portapro and sennheiser px100 i bought both pairs to do my own comparisons after 1 week i submitted a review giving the portapros a definite edge although not a dramatic one after a full month of listening i no longer use the px100's i hear things on the portapros you don't even notice on the 100's i would like to amend my original opinion to say the portapros are significantly better and provide a lifetime warranty
1835,2,"I bought this to hopefully remove a very audible hissing sound from an HTC EVO V phone.  The hiss could be heard easily when I was playing mp3 files regardless of which pair of earbuds I used.  I inserted my earbud plug into the the Koss VC20 and then plugged the VC20 into my phone.  After turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the VC20 down, I was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible.  I noticed no degradation in sound quality (same bass and treble levels, for example) when using the VC20 versus not using it. The gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume.  Well worth the price!!"
1836,0,"Not the greatest sound quality, but now, after playing 12 songs only, it started to slow down considerably... can't use it anymore, and I don't have the original packaging. Can I return it like that? Besides the packaging, the turntable itself is in excellent condition, hardly used at all.Lefteris Kritikakis"
1837,1,"I did lots of research on the m 515 and was very sure that this was the handheld for me. I was very disapointed with picture display and some other stuff. This is when i realized i shouldve gotten a pocket pc.But its still pretty good for taking notes, or a to do list."
1838,2,"I'm a headphone nut... I've invested thousands in high-end headphones, DACS, and dedicated amplifiers and I consider myself to be pretty picky. You can trust that I would give a negative review if it was warranted.For the money, you would be hard pressed to find any headphone that sounds better. Good bass without being overstated, highs are clear with good extension, and mid-range isn't harsh (my biggest complaint with headphones under the $200 mark). These have a similar sound signature to my beloved Sennheiser PX100's (not the sub-standard PX100 II (two's) that have replaced that discontinued model) at a similar price point.For anyone looking for good quality sound on a budget, you can't beat these... trust me, I've tried them all!Don't expect much in the way of isolation (blocking outside noise from coming in, or keeping your sounds from coming out) with these, and the sound quality is much more apparent in quiet environments.These don't really need an amplifier for normal listening, but I do find that they require a little more power than my Zune will put out if I'm on an airplane or train.I'd buy these again if lost or stolen."
1839,0,"I bought this lens for portraits etc...  It brings a lot of light and takes nice shots.  It does have some trouble focusing and is kind of ""loud"" focusing.  My main issue is the build.  This lens got stuck on my Canon T2i. I had to really force it off, and broke off the plastic back on the lens.  Over the next few hours of picture taking, my camera starting giving me the ER1 error more and more.  It turns out the lens broke a contact point on my camera body and shoved it back into my camera.  Fortunately a local camera shop was able to fix it for very, very cheap and only 1/2 hour of time.  For the price, it is still a decent deal.  Just be careful taking it on and off.  I got lucky."
1840,0,"I wanted a 1/4"" to 1/8"" mono to stereo.  What I got was a 1/8 to 1/8 stereo to mono. I think I'll just go to a brick and mortar and buy it there. This page is too confusing and, potentially, a waste of money."
1841,0,See the attached photo ( when it appears ) to see the problem. A gap in the needle nose pliers that should not be when fully closed.
1842,2,"Years ago I was introduced to a st of Koss Studio Pros.  They were actually a full-size headphone which looked very similar to these. They were lightweight, very comfortable, and had the most amazing clarity.  It seems to me that Koss has simply miniaturized the very same Koss headphones I had years ago. They are lightweight, very comfortable, and retain the same clarity of the larger phones I used to have. These are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock. The highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full, but not overwhelming like the Dre's.  One of the things that I noticed more so than other headphones I've own is the separation of sound. You can distinguish the left and right channel clearly. It totally adds to the listening experience.  My only complaint is, as far as I know, Koss has discontinued the full-size version of this headphone which I used to have.  I would like to see it on the market again, but until then, I am very pleased with these."
1843,0,"The headpiece is Way too tall, and not adjustable.  That soft band does nothing to help it fit closer to the head.  It must have some sort of afterthought to try to make them fit, but it didn't work.  The ear pieces themselves might have been good had it not been for the fit."
1844,2,"This is a very good mouse overall. It glows, which was a nice surprise, but I don't find that it heats up at all. It fits your hand nicely, and the 3rd button is easily accesible but can not be pushed accidentally. I find the 3rd button is most useful when you set it to execute the back function of your browser. Sometimes, however, for no apparent reason the pointer sticks in one space or moves around on its own. Other than that, it is an nice mouse."
1845,0,"I bought this adapter because I needed a second port on my laptop, and my coworkers had bought this model.After 6 weeks of gentle use (this stays in the office and doesn't travel), the door on my unit has come apart. It is a very poor design: the hinge on the plastic door (which is integral to holding the cable) is hinged on plastic tabs that wear.I would expect the design to be fragile, but not to be completely unusable in 6 weeks. Stay away..."
1846,2,I do a lot of working travel and I'm always wary when I have to leave my laptop in the hotel room. A friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss. From that moment I decide that I needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet I chose the Kensington 64068F Microsaver Notebook Lock and security cable. Of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room together!
1847,0,"These aren't bad for the price, but the bass sucks. Not so great for music, but talk wouldn't be so bad."
1848,0,Poor quality cable shielding and connectors.  I use this to extend the mic input on my PC and it puts noise into the audio.  Another cable I have does not have this issue.
1849,2,"It's a pretty simple system that does just what it says. The channels in which the wires sit are adequate for maybe 3 to 5 wires, depending on what type they are, and seem fairly durable. The elbow connectors seems less durable and like they maybe liable to pop off if place somewhere where they may get bumped (not a problem for me). My primary complaint is that the assortment of connectors may be insufficient for many applications if you're trying to navigate around a series of corners. I wasn't able to take the path I preferred on account of the limited connector options (I could have used more of one type of connector and none of the others). But I knew what I was getting when I ordered it.And a suggestion re: the adhesive backing: Some reviewers have claimed that it is very difficult to remove should you ever desire to do so. I can see how this would be the case. The peel-and-stick adhesive certainly looks as if it's intended to be permanent, which is probably a good thing. Since I may want to remove my Wiremold in a few years and don't relish the idea of scraping several feet of adhesive off my wall, I opted to score the adhesive a couple times every foot or two, so that I could remove only a one- or two-inch piece of the backing. Most wires aren't that heavy, and a four foot run of this probably doesn't need four feet of adhesive to support it (especially when it's placed vertically). So only exposing an inch or two of adhesive every foot or two will hopefully save me trouble down the road and should be plenty secure in the meantime."
1850,2,"Took me a long time of reading reviews before I settled on purchasing this bag. Too big, too small, what is right for me? It fits my t3i 18-55mm kit and my 55-250mm zoom lens without much issue. The spare battery, charger, USB cable all fit in the front pocket. There isn't much room for anything else though."
1851,2,"This is my second one, I could never get my first one from my wife so I needed to buy one for myself,  It works well and is relatively inexpensive.It is a great buy for the money and I have had several other Koss products before and alway been very satisfied with them"
1852,1,"In one swift stroke, Apple Computer has sought to redefine the portable digital music player. With the iPod's 5GB of space, you can tote around hundreds of digital songs and non-music files too. What can I say? It's ultra-cool, ultra-light (6.5 oz) and you'll want one the second you pick it up in your hands. The LCD display is top notch, and the playback controls are as simple as they get. With the iPod's fast Firewire connection, you can download an entire CD onto the device in about 10 to 20 seconds. Moreover, the iPod's battery is recharged through the Firewire port, another plus. Still, the gadget has its drawbacks: First, compatibility. Only Firewire Mac users are able to use the iPod.  Also, there is no record function, and the price is steep.

1853,1,you really cant go wrong getting this product. wouldn't recommend it for professional use but for home use its money well spent
1854,0,I bought this in hopes to connect my older Sony D8 camcorder via USB using the RCA DV i/o connection.  I could not get it to work.
1855,2,"I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right?"
1856,0,"I had to buy this product for college and we used it to of course design homes.  It is the stupidest thing in the world.  First off, it takes up like 350GB of hard drive space.  You HAVE TO HAVE 4GB of ram to load a picture.  It is so slow and eats so much speed and space on your computer (because of all the little furniture and plants and features, etc) that you will want to punch your monitor anytime you get a little ways into creating something.  The more detail you add, the slower this thing gets to do anything, even save or open.If you are designing dog houses, this is your product.  If you want to try and hang windows and doors on multiple levels of a designed house, forget it.  They are all mathematically calculated in a way that you will always be adding electrical outlets and doors on the first floor or basement when you meant to put them upstairs.  It doesn't know where you are, and you won't realize until you see that the whole house's windows and doors and outlets and fans and furniture and staircases are all in the basement.  Don't buy it."
1857,2,"Sweet, cheap, glorious sounding phones. Get a volume control (also Koss) and you are all set.  Cord is a bit short, but plugged into the volume control you will have plenty of length. These are really excellent sounding phones. I couldn't believe the difference between a couple of other cheap ones I have.  Highly recommended!These have been highly regarded for many years, and I recall having had a pair maybe 15 years ago. Also you may want to buy some replacement foam pads. I use mine outside and they get a lot of sweat on them. Changing pads is a breeze."

1860,1,"I recently bought two new pairs of binoculars from Amazon:  (1) Pentax Papilio 6.5 X 21 and (2) Canon 8 X 25 IS.  I have a separate review on the Papilio, which I rate at 5 stars.  I give a few comparisons in this review on the Canon because both units share a common limitation that requires design workarounds.  Pentax got it right, Canon didn't.  Note that the Papilio has no image stabilization and is relatively inexpensive (~$95).First the good news about the Canon.  The image stabilizer works great.  I have a tremor which makes it difficult for me to use binoculars at 8X and up.  One push of the on button, and the image locks in place.  There is no noticeable delay for initial lock-in and no noticeable delay when changing view.  That's what you get for the extra ~$160 over the Papilio.  Image stabilizer performance is solid.As other reviewers have noted, two negs for the image stabilizer.  (1) It uses a CR 123 lithium battery instead of more common and lower cost AA batteries (which are used in the more expensive Canon IS models).  (2) The on/off button is momentary on.  Press and hold down to operate the image stabilizer.  I bought these for a concert.  Holding it down with a single finger for more than 5 min gets tiring.  I needed to lock one finger on top of another for extended viewing; gets annoying in the course of an hour.  A bit tricky getting the fingers positioned right to hold the button down while focussing.  A full on/off switch would be great for extended viewing. On the plus side, the button is slightly recessed.  It won't accidently turn on if you lay the unit down on a table with the button on the bottom.In all other respects, optically and mechanically, the Papilio is superior.I.  OpticalThe Pentax has good optical quality edge-to-edge.  Flat field, no noticeable vignetting or color fringes.  Edges of lenses smoothly ground.  Internal surfaces of lens barrel properly dulled, no stray reflections.The Canon is disappointing.  Flat field, no noticeable color fringes but noticeable vignetting around the edges of the field.  The internal surfaces of the lens barrel are shiny.  Stray reflections are noticeable; mainly when viewing against the sky.  Edges of lenses have minute chips; mainly noticeable when viewing against the sky.  In optics in this price range, I would the expect the edges of the lenses to be smoothly ground and blackened, and internal surfaces of the lens barrel to be properly dulled.II.  Mechanical(A)  ShapePentax has a comfortable ergonomic shape.  Rubber coating gives the right amount of grip, no goopy or tacky feel like some other rubber coatings.  Canon is poorly shaped and uncomfortable to hold.  Hard plastic body and smooth surface leads to a slippery grip when held with sweaty hands.(B) Interpupillary AdjustmentIn most binocular designs, there are separate right and left barrels joined together with a center hinge (like a door hinge).  Each barrel houses an objective lens and an eyepiece.  Interpupillary adjustment (distance between left and right eyes) is performed by flexing the two barrels about the center hinge.In both the Pentax and the Canon, the objective lenses are held in a fixed housing to accommodate their special features (close focus for the Pentax and image stabilization for the Canon).  Consequently, there is no center hinge.  The eyepieces pivot about the fixed housing.  You need to pivot both eyepieces in unison.  In the Pentax, the eyepieces are ergonomically shaped and the pivots are smooth, with just the right amount of friction to hold the final position.  In contrast, the eyepieces in the Canon are awkwardly shaped and the pivots are stiff; you need to wrestle them into position.(C) FocusBoth units have a center focus.  The focus knob on the Pentax turns much smoother than the one on the Canon.(D) EyecupsThe Pentax has helically mounted eyecups.  You adjust the height by twisting them.  There are click stops (three positions).  The Canon has the el-cheapo roll-up/roll-down rubber eyecups.(E) Lens CoversNeither the Pentax nor the Canon have covers for the objective lenses.  The Pentax has a two eyepiece covers held together by a plastic strap.  There is a plastic loop so you can tie them to the neckstrap.  The Canon has individual eyepiece covers (no loops), easy to lose.  You need to unroll the eyecups to put on the eyepiece covers.  So if you normally wear glasses and use the eyecups in the rolled down position, you need to unroll them to put on the eyepiece covers.Summary:  Canon has a great image stabilizer.  To maintain a low price point, they compromised on the optical and mechanical design.  The Pentax, however, shows that, given the limitation of a fixed objective lens housing, proper optical and mechanical design is feasible at a low price point.  If  Canon could combine the Pentax design with its image stabilizer at a price point of  ~$250, they would have a #1 hit.Note that the touted list price of $410 is well above that listed on the Canon website (just under $300)."
1861,2,"This product does a great job of theft deterrent.  I say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it. However this is the case with any cable-lock.Non the less, the cable itself is thick and high quality.  The thicker design makes it both look and feel sturdier as well as more deterring to a thief than some other, thinner cables I've seen.  Its black plastic coating helps to make it more aesthetically pleasing and keep the metal from rubbing against my wooden desk.  Like many other cables this one uses a loop design as the anchor.While the thicker design is great for strength it lacks flexibility (the only downfall of the entire product).  While this cable is capable of making sharp turns, it takes a lot of effort.  If you have a sharp bend near the lock it could put a lot of torque on your computer.The actual lock is free to rotate to keep the cable from twisting.  The lock uses a barrel key and comes with two copies, allowing me to keep one on my key chain and a spare in my safe (additional keys can be order through Kensington using the ID number on the side of the keys, should you need them).  When deciding between cables, I decided on one with a key because I travel around a lot and wanted to be able to quickly lock and unlock my computer.Overall, this is a great product.  I currently only need one but should the need arise, I would certainly a second!Pros:- Thick cable- Long cable- Aesthetically pleasing- Two keysCons:- Not very flexible"
1862,2,"Pros: Great features include 10x optical zoom (incredible!), viewfinder LCD, photo size adj, mic and MPG recordign ability for quick little videos.Cons: Bulky, battery power can go fast if using a lots of features.Overall, I'd get this Mavica again. Good stuff from Sony!"
1863,2,"I really love this kensington lock. It just snaps right in. No little plug for the whole is necessary. The part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable. It took me a few minutes to figure out that I had to use the key to attach the lock to the Lap Top but once I figured out how to use it, it is a very quick lock or un-lock. (I could have read the directions but where's the fun in that.)"
1864,2,"Try to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price. I had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around $40.00 and one channel crapped out after about 6 months. hard to believe, but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony. go figure.For the price and the sound, these earbuds can't be beat. good going Koss."
1865,2,"Koss VC20 Volume Control unit. Does exactly what it says it does, exactly as it expected. No more, no less."
1866,2,"This is far smaller than expected. It will not hold two cameras and lenses. Only a body and very few accessories. Having said that, the build quality is excellent, or outstanding whichever is better. If you do not need a lot of equipment this bag is great. Camera with lens, flash, and a couple of smaller items will fit on the inside with pockets on the exterior for cards, cables or other small items."
1867,0,"There's really only ONE reason to get this camera: It's tiny. It's so miniature that it can fit completely inside a closed Altoids mint tin.  And that's really cool.  However, the picture quality is awful, even on the highest settings.  Despite the fact that this is a 3.2 MP camera, the pictures come out very soft (blurry), with all the fine details & colors lost in the photographs.  I bought this camera after using a Nikon Coolpix 995 for years, and taking the exact same pictures side-by-side, you would not believe the difference.  The Coolpix 995 gave me sharp, color-rich, crystal-clear photographs... whereas the Pentax Optio S made those same images blurry and washed out.  However, the Coolpix 995 is a monster to carry around (it's about 8 times the size of the Optio S), so use your best judgement when determining what your needs are."
1868,0,"I order this one over the metal one to save five bucks. I figured I didn't need a great one to look at the moon. But;  wish I would have paid the few bucks extra. The plastic threads are uneven, and its very difficult to screw in the the eyepiece evenly. It feels like the whole plastic body was deformed from heat.Just pay the extra five bucks and get the metal one."
1869,0,"I've tried many different types of over the ear head phones (JVC, Panasonic, etc) but the ones I like the most are these Sony earphones. But...like another reviewer said, the left earbud ALWAYS fails on me. Most of them last around a year at the most and the left side always just shuts down.These are very comfy and fit snugly in your ear. It also doesn't pop out when you go running so that's why I like them. Some other ones (Panasonic in-ear) always pops out and I end up not wearing them anyways.Even though this is the best sport ear phones I've had - it's also the worst because of something faulty with it in itself - the left earbud. I'm not sure why this happens but it is always the same thing over and over again."
1870,0,"I got this because I wanted to be able to switch between my computer speakers and my headphones. I'd listen to things through my speakers when no one is around and through the headphones when people are near by so I would not disturb them. This device was a little on the expensive side considering what it does but it's a Plantronics device so I expected a quality device. Sadly, the device lets sound through on BOTH outputs, reguardless of what is selected. The sound for the non-selected speakers or headphone side does come out several db lower then the selected side but I wanted something that would fully switch between headphone or speakers and not allow any sound to come out of the other device I am not using at that moment. When I use this to listen via headphones, I still have to switch the power off to my speakers to not disturb anyone."
1871,2,"Ok, here is the good stuff--The Philips EXpanium has a tough, rugged case.  It plays regular audio CDs as well as homemade CD-Rs and CD-RWs, which is a real PLUS!  The biggest plus is that it also plays CDs that have been recorded with MP3 files.  It can play up to 999 MP3 files, if you can squeeze that many small ones onto a CD. More likely, you will have about 200 songs.  Compare that to the 10 or 12 songs you get on a standard audio CD!The sound quality is, as you would expect, great.  It has anti-knock protection.  It can play the songs in sequence, or shuffle them.  It has all the standard features found on most portable CD players.  And, it has a separate audio out jack in addition to the headphone jack.Now, for the bad stuff--The silver control buttons look pretty sharp, but they're hard to identify.  The LCD display is tiny and not very bright.  If you record more than one &quot;album&quot; (that's the name Philips uses to designate a separate file folder), the CD will play all the songs in all the folders (shuffled or not).  You can &quot;program&quot; it to play only certain songs, but that's kind of tedious.  It would also be nice if the display showed the file name or song title instead of just the sequence number of the file.  And, although it does come with a car adapter, I found the volume is not high enough.  You have to turn your car stereo volume up to the point where it begins to hum.Overall, it's a good buy, and in my opinion, it represents the future of music players."
1872,2,"What wonderful speakers these are! I read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to use my gift certificates (courtesy of echo.com) towards these speakers.  I admit, when I pulled them out of the box they looked awfully weenie. After pluggin' them in and firing up good old winamp, their quality blew me away. The human voice sounds so convincing through the 2 inch satellite speakers, and the subwoofer compliments them perfectly. Unlike other systems I've heard, the sub &quot;knows&quot; when NOT to broadcast- the resulting response is amazing.My only qualms about ordering this system is that its packing weight- 18 lbs- carries a corresponding shipping cost of a little over 8 bucks. Well worth it but something to consider when figuring the final cost. ... .I'd recommend this system to anybody! Check it out!"
1873,0,"I installed this on a duplex outlet to protect my microwave and toaster (both with electronic controls).  I noticed that this only has a single prong.  The first time I tried to use both devices together, it failed.  I've looked for an amp rating, but can not find one."
1874,2,"Works as advertised, should be sold with a ball head mount, but that is not required.  Does assist in keeping the camera steady in lower lighting situations, and makes for a great walking stick also as it don't fit in my camera bag at all."
1875,2,"This wire manager kit has everything you need... elbows, 4ft long rails, etc but its way too expensive for a simple plastic product. It looks like its ""Made in USA"" stated on the actual product packaging, so I guess I don't feel too bad supporting us... wait a minute... a high volume sales plastic thing still made right here? WOW, now I'm impressed. Anyway, it works good, sticks well to the wall, looks good too. I was able to fit two 12 gauge speaker cables and a coaxial cable TV wire thru it and still manage to close the latch, though a bit tricky. Overall nice product. I have seen the real cheapo versions of these and this is better than those. A bit of advice installing... lay down on your stomach when applying it right above your molding, to be sure it is going on straight, take your time or you'll be pulling your wall down to fix it."
1876,2,I have a Koss Headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space.  The quality is very good with the headset and volume control.
1877,2,"I had to use a Dremel tool to grind away at the inside to allow clearance for the Legend HCx's micro SD card slot.  This was a simple task and only took a minute but if you do not have a Dremel tool or doubt your skills you might want to skip this mount.Once the modification was done this mount seems like a great unit for the price and I'm very happy with it.BTW, Garmin lists this mount on their site as an accessory for the HCx, however the packaging for this mount lists 6 GPSs as being compatible with this mount and the Legend HCx is not one of them.  So, which mount is the right one for the Legend HCx is still a mystery but this one will work with a slight modification."
1878,2,"I bought this gear bag based on reviews I read and most said this bag was huge so I was a bit surprised at how small it is. My fault for not double checking the dimensions. I guess if you're using a point and shoot, then it is huge. A bit small for a DSLR though. The tag claims it will hold 2 bodies and 3-4 lenses but I don't know how this is possible. It barely holds my EOS XS with two zoom lenses and Albinar 90 MDT-Z strobe in the main compartment. Neither lens is really very big. I'm not sure how it would hold 2 bodies and 3-4 lenses but it does what I need it to do and that's really all that matters.The build quality is superb and I expect this to last a long time. The strap clips and attachments are metal, not plastic, and the zippers are large and heavy duty. Though they are made of nylon, they appear very robust. The main compartment layout is adjustable with very nice padded detachable dividers and the gear is very well protected. The dividers fold over on the top for a layered effect which is how my strobe fits over the lenses and body. Overall, I am very satisfied with this bag. For the money, it really can't be beat. Just make sure you check the dimensions and match them to your gear and needs."
1879,2,"The PortaPro has apparently been around since 1985. That in itself should tell you something about this product. I recently bought a notebook computer for around $500. It has a 750GB hard drive. Back in 2000 I bought my first notebook. It had 6gb and cost $1,100. In Electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago. There are good reasons they haven't been though. The longevity of the PortaPro speaks volume about this product.I am fortunate enough to have a Soul by Ludacris SB300. It is a $300 headphone. I like it a lot. It produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments. The PortaPro does the same. The PortaPro actually sound better. The sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity. They even leak less sound, are lighter, and require no batteries.  The PortaPro bring an unbelievably accurate, well-balanced, rich, detailed, and lush sound for the price. You are getting the music, all of the music, the way the artists wanted it to be heard. It isn't often a product can cost 8 to 10 Times less than other good products but the PortaPro does. You can get new headphones And a new iPod or other MP3 player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphones.And they are VERY comfortable and light. The headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above. And the adjustment bar works. I have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness. You also get virtually zero sound leakage. It makes the PortaPro the Perfect work headphones: fantastic sound, virtually no sound leakage, comfortable enough to wear all day, very light, foldable and storable.The only nitpicking I can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy. But the `goofy' gives you that nice comfort zone. All in all a quite extraordinary product. If Amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value, the PortaPro would be in it for sure. A great gift for yourself or a friend or family member. Lastly before I bought these I did some research and they do have a lifetime guarantee. You can send them in and the shipping back costs a total of $6 from what people related on the internet. You can spend many times more for these and not get any added performance. Thank you Koss."
1880,0,"As a networking &quot;internals&quot; guy, I was shocked to find that this product is fundamentally broken at the network layer.What people are complaining about here is that the device suddenly stops working and must be unplugged and plugged back in again.This is because the device is trying to be too smart, and is losing track of which power-line modules connect to which computers.  Unfortunately, in doing so, it prevents the network-level broadcast facilities from working.  The broadcast facility I'm talking about most (ARP, the address resolution protocol) would have automatically corrected the problem if the Linksys box wasn't so broken.In essence, for all you tech guys and gals, is that a learning bridge should never &quot;learn&quot; the broadcast address.If you have only PCs, and you load the Linksys driver, they do some magic to keep the devices from falling over dead...  But if you mix in a non-pc (Linux, UNIX, Macintosh) using a hub off the end of your power-line device, you're guaranteed to be frustrated.The symptoms are that some of the network works (whatever was working before the bridge tables got corrupted) and others stop working with no explanation.  The box &quot;selectively&quot; forwards traffic, and becomes deaf to other traffic.It's like being at a cocktail party, and having every third person not be able to hear you, and saying &quot;Over here!&quot; (as ARP does) doesn't help either.Ugh.  In my experience, this is somewhat typical of Linksys products...  If you have a windows PC, you're fine.  If you have anything else, they won't talk to you.I switched to the Siemens power-line module, and it has been working just fine for me."
1881,2,"Everything is O.K. except for that fact that the handle stitching is a little slant. All in all, it.s good."
1882,0,"I was pleased with these headphones until last week.  On a flight home, the left ear piece developed an extremely loud, high pitched squeal which has rendered this $100 purchase unusable.  I was disappointed as I would expect a bit more mileage out of a product this expensive.  A check of the Sennheiser website shows there are no longer warranteed so I am out of luck."
1883,1,"I bought this for my camera, but have found that it is much better to buy individual rechargeable batteries (such as Energizer) and use those with the camera. The Kodak batteries have a short life and eventually hold very little charge. Further, I would recommend buying as small a case as possible for your camera. It makes it much easier to carry the camera around and thus you are much more likely to take pictures. I've taken over 7,000 with my Kodak EasyShare CX4200 and I hope you get to take just as many yourself. Happy Snapping."
1884,0,"Did what it was supposed to, but stopped working after 18 months. It wasn't that I was constantly plugging and unplugging cables from it, I simply used it to connect two Ethernet cables and left it alone. (By the way, I have tested both of the cables in question and both still work perfectly.) Very disappointing. I replaced it withTripp Lite N033-001 Modular Coupler Straight RJ45F/F, which is working perfectly so far."
1885,2,"I was on the verge of buying Bose headphones but the price bothered me. I read at least 50 reviews from different sources and decided to buy Koss plus my picky sister said they were good. I'm pleased, they sound great and the price is right."
1886,2,I now own two of these style mice from Logitech.  My original mouse on my computer and now the mouse I just bought for my wife's computer.  I use a Mac G3 and my wife has a Window ME machine.  Both mice are great.  I will never go back to a ball mouse again.
1887,2,"I'm a somewhat new and budding amateur photographer, and to go along with my Canon XSi (Rebel 450D) I decided to pick up the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 (TLZ1) camera bag.For those who don't like reading long reviews, I'll say it upfront--this bag was exactly what I expected it to be.  I bought my XSi with the kit (18-55mm IS) lens, and the camera body with lens attached fit perfectly.  The bag is not too large to carry around, and easy enough to open.  It holds the basic accessories--extra battery, extra SD card, Lens Pen, and even my user manual--I'm new and always curious about the settings in my technology, so occasionally I'll use it as a quick reference.I do like the design of opening away from the body--this allows a bit easier access since the flap falls away from you.  This keeps the bag open a bit better when trying to fish around, though I don't really keep anything in the main compartment other than the camera/lens, so there's rarely any fishing to be done there.The size of the side compartment is nice, and since it has small pockets within the zippered compartment, you can organize a bit more neatly if you have a system.  (Used/full battery/memory cards on one side, empty on the other, etc.)  It's never that tough to access either since it's in the side that faces away from the body when strapped on the shoulder.My one problem with this bag is in the interior main compartment.  I do own another Lowepro bag, and inside the main compartments of both are small subspaces for memory cards, etc.  In my other Lowepro bag, made for more carrying space, the subcompartments are velcro, and there is a microfiber cloth that can be lain across the top of the camera to prevent scratches to the screen if the camera is positioned in a vertical orientation and the LCD is facing upward.  This bag, on the other hand, has a zippered compartment, with no microfiber cloth.  In the closed position, this zipper is covered by a small flap that should prevent scratches, but I am just slightly uneasy about it, because if I forget to zip it ALL the way closed, the zipper may be loose enough to scratch.  Also, the actual material of this subcompartment makes me a little nervous--it's RELATIVELY soft, but it doesn't take much to scratch or scuff LCD screens if pressure is added, so I am a bit more cautious when using this bag.  Still, the interior does feature two velcro pieces which can be moved in order to properly support your camera inside the bag, which is always a nice feature to have, even if you rarely or never adjust them.The only other minor gripe I have with this bag is that the strap leaves a bit to be desired.  It's a bit thin, and the padded section isn't that well padded.  However, since this bag is of a smaller variety, you probably won't be carrying as much weight, so it may not feel too harsh on your shoulder.  On a long hot day, however, it may become a bit of an irritation.  I'm considering swapping the strap for another, since it's relatively easy to do.  Note also, I'm somewhat new to DSLRs, so I'm still adjusting to the weight of the camera in the first place.  After time, this strap irritation might go away just from becoming accustomed to the camera's weight in general.  But again, the strap is a minor gripe since you can replace it with ease for not too much money.I would like to note that larger lenses may be a problem for this bag.  In trying to fit my new Canon 70-300mm 4.5-5.6 IS lens in the bag attached to the camera, it is simply too long for the bag.  The bag may be able to squeeze closed, but it wouldn't be something I'm comfortable doing with such an expensive piece of equipment.  I would expect anything an inch or two shorter would be fine, but my lens, even when taking up the least space possible, fully retracted, simply will not fit.  However, this is made to be a more compact bag, so it was to be expected, and this does not detract from its overall use."
1888,2,"I tried several cameras on a recent dive trip, including a Kodak and a Fuji disposable waterproof camera.Neither camera has a flash, which means that everything will come out in shades of blue under water unless you bring your own light.Neither camera leaked, which gave them an edge over more expensive ""professional"" cameras on this trip.Both the Kodak and Fuji look very similar with a sealed plastic case (with slight positive buoyancy) and thick rubberbands for securing to a wrist or clipping to a BCD.I have to give the edge to the Fuji in terms of both design and results. The Fuji was easier to wind and to snap shots with and the pictures came out sharper. The 800 film in the Kodak produced shots that were way too grainy.I'd give it 5 stars if they added a flash and a bigger viewfinder!"
1889,2,For its size it has good sound.  I connected it to some external speakers instead of the ones it came with and it works fine.  The included remote is a bonus although it doesn't seem to control the cassette player.
1890,0,"I bought this particular model because all the good reviews that I read. However, my unit quit working in 2 months. The LED is still green, and when you unplug it from the wall outlet it still makes loud beeps. But it won't power up the things connected. I heard other people have the same problem and it might be related to the batteries.I returned mine yesterday, but since it's over 30 days old, I can't get the reimbursement for the shipping cost.In conclusion, I can't recommand this thing, although I know APC is supposed to be a company that makes quality products. You may need to try another model."

1894,2,"I got this holder mainly because I wanted to be able to keep my GPSr handy wile hiking, but out or the way and still recieveing. Here is the deal, I geocache, and I do it quite often. When I used to go out on longer hikes I would loop the leash on my GPSr around the strap on my pack, and then tuck my GPSr under the strap on my sholder where I couldn't see it, but it could see the sky, all that got me was a sore sholder and a GPSr dangeling by my waste not recieveing. Now with the holster I leash the holster to my pack, and clip the holster to my pack strar at about mid chest. I can see what I need to through the window of the holster, and if I need more detail I just pull the reciever out so I can see the screen better. This set up keeps my reciever close at hand, out of the way and recieveing when I don't need to see it, and protected from scratches (if you are a cacher, you know your GPSr has lots of scratches). As for the window that everyone complains about, I see it this way, I would rather have to take out my GPSr to read it better than have to replace my GPS because the window on it has gouges in it. Look at this holster as insurance with the benifit of keeping the GPS out of the way and it is a great bargain. Untill someone offers tore up GPS insurance this is the way to go."

1896,2,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter (age 21) about 8 months ago. She is actually a knowledgeable photographer having taken photography courses in school, but wanted a simple point-and-shoot that she could use without having to think about f-stops and shutter speeds. As I am also a photography fan since my mis-spent youth, its common ground for us, and I get to see all of her pictures.I have to say that the camera has far exceeded both our expectations. It does a very respectable job under a variety of conditions and produces sharp, well-focused, consistent photos. It is simple to use and the zoom lens is terrific. We have not seen the flash problems that some of the other reviewers have reported. The only difficulty she has had with it is the pause between pressing the shutter button and the camera actually shooting, but that is overcome by using ""real-time"" mode whenever red-eye reduction is not an issue.But I think perhaps the best feature of this camera is its portability. It is so small and light (and the lens retracts into the body and covers up when the power is turned off) that she is able to keep it in her pocketbook at all times. Whenever life presents her with one of those ""Gee I wish I had a camera"" moments, she does!If you're looking for something inexpensive and durable enough so that you can keep it with you, and that you can use without too much thinking, this is a good bet.***Update 10/02*** Just 3 weeks before the 1-year warranty would have expired, the camera developed a serious problem with it's autofocus. We called the Canon 800 number and were referred to a local authorized repair center to whom we brought it. They called after a week and told us that they would have to send it to Canon and that there would be a $10 service charge. That was about a week ago.Even though the situation is not yet resolved, I thought it was important to post this update, since I've seen exactly this same problem reported in several of the other reviews here. The camera was not heavily used nor was it abused in the year that my daughter owned it. I am reducing my rating to 4-stars because of this. I will update again when we get the camera back from Canon."
1897,1,"I purchased Rocket Fish wires before and I loved it. Since the review was pretty good on this RCA wires, I decided to try this. I suppose it does what it suppose to do but when I was stripping the end, I noticed the copper wires too fragile that they would come off pretty easily.  I did not have this issue with any other speaker wires so........But overall, it is ok for money."
1898,1,The units worked initially well. Yet within a period less than one month the receiver lost its voice. It seems that the alarm speaker was defective. I hope I can get a replacement.
1899,0,"I bought a MacBook Pro, which runs pretty hot, and needed something to help cool the heat generated from the notebook.  I opted to buy this Targus PA248U Notebook Chill Pad at a Northern California Fry's Electronics store, since the price seems right and the spec was comparable to other models that costs $10 more (without the sales discount offered at the time).Anyway, after using it for about 3 months, I noticed that the fan noises started to get really loud and annoying.  To the point that it is drowning out the sound from DVDs or videos that is playing on the MacBook Pro.  The amount of air that the fan circulates is also reduced considerable.  Trying to clean the dust built up was a real hassle (design does not allow for easy cleaning).  Using the compressed air cleaners helps, but it does not fix the fact that the fans seem to be spinning off-balance and rubbing against something when turned on.By pure coincidence my roommate also has a Targus PA248U for her laptop, and she complains about the same issue after hearing the familiar loud and annoying sound coming from my Chill Pad.  Below is the list of pros and cons that we came up with for the product:Pros:Fans initially circulates a fair amount of air to help cool down laptops.Chill pad is not heavy, so it is portable.Runs on power from USB.Cons:Design Quality - poor.  Made of cheap plastic that can't support the weight of average size laptops/notebooks.Not much clearance underneath the chill pad to draw air.Difficult to perform routine cleaning to get rid of built up dust.Rubber pads on the corners not sufficient enough to prevent scratching the bottom of your laptops with the chill pad.Unit is light weight, but bulky (common complaint for almost all products in this category)Product lifespan for me is about 8-9 months (my roommate gave up on hers after about the same)Fan noises can get extremely loud and annoying.Unit has stopped working while plugged in and turned on, and caused notebook to overheat and shutdown unexpectedly.Can't easily replace the small component fans (even if you take the unit apart)Would I recommend or purchase this product again?  Most likely not, unless it is priced cheaper as a disposable equipment that you replace regularly."
1900,0,"I felt that my Linksys wasn't putting out enough signal, so I decided to try a D-link.  The signal problem went away, and that's the only reason I give this thing 2-stars--the signal is MUCH better than the Linksys.However, better signal doesn't do much good if the router doesn't work correctly!!!  I frequently use VPN from home to get into the network at work, and 9/10 times when I try to VPN in, the router gets possessed and reboots itself for no apparent reason.  It'll start to log in, and then I look over at the router--all of the lights flash on for a second, then they all turn off, then they all come on again--and my VPN connection is terminated!  This never happened with the Linksys.Also, this router locks up frequently for no given reason.  You'll go to use your computer, and...nothing.  No response from the router.  The only way to fix it is to unplug the power, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in.  I emailed their tech support--want to know what they told me?  Not much.  They copied and pasted the FAQ page from their support page, telling me to try things I already tried, one of them being, &quot;Check your logs.  Is there someone causing a lot of traffic on your network?  If so, you may want to block that person's I.P.&quot;  Oh, thank you for the suggestion!  Your router doesn't work properly, so I should just kick my users off of it.  Brilliant!Also, the static DHCP feature they added doesn't work right.  Everytime I tried to add more than one MAC address to it, the router froze up and wouldn't accept it.So, I'm going back to the Linksys, and I guess I'm just going to have to install another wireless access point to take care of this range problem.  While the range of the Linksys might not be as good, at least the router functions properly!  I'd also like to mention that this is the 2nd time I've tried D-link (a different model this time), and I had the same problems with the first one.  Until they get the bugs out of these things, I will certainly NOT be buying another one."
1901,1,"I bought the ""Studio 10"" before understanding the Archos product lines.  All their disk-based MP3 players look alike from a distance but there are some significant differences... The ""Recorder"" line has significant improvements in the LCD display (8 lines vs 2, this makes a huge difference), file navigation and manipulation (menu keys, dedicated on/off buttons), audio output quality, USB 2.0 support (""Recorder 20"" only, I believe).  The ""Recorder"" line can also record MP3s via built-in or external mic, but even if you don't plan on recording much the playback advantages of the ""Recorder"" line are definitely worth the extra money.  Firmware updates are available from Archos website, so be sure to upgrade your player after purchasing.  I know this is more a review of the ""Recorder"" and not the ""Studio"", but it's important to know that a better Archos player is available."
1902,1,"I don't have this product.  The solution I came up with is to put velcro (I used industrial strength) on the exterior side of the lens cap, and on the bottom of the camera (use the soft velcro on whichever of those will be touching something in your camera bag that the hard velcro will stick to).  I haven't used the camera much since, but it seems good so far."
1903,0,"When I hooked this cable up from my mac mini to a TV, there was interference on the signal.  When I hooked up a different S Video cable that I had there was no interference.  I don't recommend this cable."

1905,0,"I bought the Coolpad after reading the positive reviews here on Amazon.com, but am quite disappointed. My Fujitsu has vents both at the bottom and in the rear, so it doesn't overheat, but can get quite hot when I edit digital videos (a CPU- and hard drive-intense task). I bought the Coolpad hoping it would help cool down the laptop so the laptop's internal fan wouldn't have to work too hard.To my disappointment there does not seem to be any cooling improvement whatsoever. If your laptop has vents only at the bottom and has no rubber feet, then this may help. Again, it's a strong ""may"" or ""might,"" as in ""perhaps,"" as acknowledged on the packaging. I suspect the Coolpad doesn't elevate the laptop high enough for the convection principle to work in reality.On the plus side, the Coolpad does insulate your laptop from the desk surface, thus preserving your desktop as well as prevening spilled coffee from soaking up the bottom of your laptop computer. The upper metal plate also rotates, which is nice for showing others the screen or when you use the laptop while watching TV.But, the Coolpad doesn't do its main job right, hence it's useless.  If you want something that can really cool your laptop, look for a cheap product called ""Bytecc Notebook Cooler"" which has two built-in fans."
1906,1,"For the last 8 years I've been using a set of Polk RM6700 surround speakers and a Polk PWS303 sub to power my home theater setup.  This has worked OK, but I recently got the itch to make some upgrades; and it seemed like a good idea to get in-ceiling speakers for surrounds instead of having speakers suspended from the ceiling like I had before.Originally, I was going to buy a pair of the TC60i speakers as surrounds; but, when I saw the price of these RC60i's on Amazon, I just couldn't resist.Once the speakers arrived, I waited until my wife took the kids to swimming lessons so I could get these installed while she was gone to surprise her (she is really happy about getting rid of the hanging speakers).  Since I had already run wires when I installed the previous speakers, putting these up couldn't have been easier.  I traced the included template with a pencil and then cut out the hole using a jig saw.  After packing the area above the speaker with insulation, I just popped them in and screwed them down.As a side note, I didn't have any problems with tight grills that many users have reported.  They popped right off both speakers using a safety pin and went on just as easily.Anyway, I had completely installed both speakers and cleaned up my mess before the wife and kids showed back up from swimming lessons.  It was about 30 minutes before anyone realized I had even done anything:).Unfortunately, after listening to them for a couple of days against my previous smaller RM3250 satellites - I decided that they just weren't cutting it.  Honestly, these speakers don't even hold there own vs. the sats with 3.25"" drivers in tiny enclosures.  They sound kind of hollow with the empty space behind them.  (They were installed on the first floor of a 2-story house, so they don't have empty attic above them; but there is a lot of hollow ceiling between the floors.)Lucky for me, the uninstall went just as smoothly as the original install.  I replaced these with the TC60i surrounds that I had originally been looking at and the difference is amazing.  The new TC60i's are the best sounding speakers in my setup right now - although I'm not done upgrading the other speakers yet.  They also balance perfectly after running through the setup on my receiver.Overall, I would only recommend these speakers as satellites if you are using really small speakers for your center/right/left.  If you ever plan to listen to music, then skip these - and I wouldn't ever use them in the front of a home theater setup.  The LC60i speakers do cost more (although I found a great price on sale), but I think they are worth it when it comes to sound quality - especially for something that will be installed in the ceiling."
1907,2,"Wow, great unit, like the battery saver, memory keys, scans channels for activity. Battery life is super like other reviews have said. Have to have a cobra adapter to use the magnetic roof mount. The unit does just as well (with roof mount) as my old unit that has the tradition attached mike, and I can take it out easy when parked. I don't talk much, just listen-(the unit is hard to bring up and face to talk because of all the wires attached...)"

1910,2,"This is my second pair of PortaPro 'phones, and my third pair of headphones using these drivers. They may just be the best headphones I've ever owned- they're not perfect, but they have proven sturdy, they travel well, and they sound great. No kidding; the only headphones I've used that sounded better were the expensive Bose noise-cancelling sort, so I consider this money well spent.Drawbacks: A little pricey. I bought the first pair for under $25 on a competing site, so you might do better with another vendor. The steel band can be a little uncomfortable, but hasn't been for me.Bottom line, these are a great buy and I look forward to using them for a long, long, long time."
1911,1,"For less than $25 and with so many positive reviews, I decided to pick these up to use while working at home.My initial impression was that these sounded great.  I was hearing parts of songs I'd never noticed before.  Bass was good and every song/movie sounded fantastic.However, after about 20 minutes of use my ears started to hurt.  I have a pretty averaged sized head and averaged sized ears but these headphones really made my ears sore.  My girlfriend found the same to be true as well although it took her longer to feel an discomfort.  So I gave these a three, what's the point of great sound if I can't stand to have these on my head.  Somewhat subjective I know but just something to keep in mind."
1912,2,"I'm using this item in line for a set of wired headphones for a TV. The output from the TV is fixed so I needed to have a volume control in line so I could turn down the volume on the TV so I could watch and leave the room quite. This control gave me a couple more feet of length and it works flawlessly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I'm using the same headphones I use with my iPod.Addendum: I've had my volume control for a year now; and it continues to work very well. I use it everyday, and I've had no problems with it. I saw one reviewer that complained it was hard to use; I can't imagine how that could be. The control wheel is recessed into the unit, but is easy to use by just sliding your thumb over the wheel. I've found it to be very robust; once it attached to the end of my headphones the unit reaches to floor; but it's well made, and has taken a beating with any problems."
1913,1,"I ordered this based on all the great reviews it received after needing more than the 500 feet of Pyle 14 AWG speaker wire ended up being  not enough for my project (my bad, not theirs). I got this product a day early which is great and the quality is fine, but for the price I could have gone with 100 feet of the Pyle cable for 18.99 instead of the 23.98 I paid for this, plus the Pyle cable is much nicer and finely braided instead of twisted strands and had a thicker casing than the RCA. Since my project needs to be done in two days I will keep the RCA cable as I know it will be adequate. If I had more time I would have returned this product for the other. There is nothing wrong with this product, it is just that the other is a bit nicer less cost, and all my wiring would match, but no one will notice that anyway."
1914,1,"When I bought my new flat screen TV/VCR/DVD combo, I thought I would ""upgrade"" my antenna as well. I have to admit that I now receive two more channels and some of the others come in clearer now. The only thing I don't like is that every single time you go to a particular channel you have to fool with this antenna to get a clear picture. My old antenna once you set it for a particular channel, that channel always came in clear and maybe the others a little shadowy but it was always great for that channel. This one is not that way,if you set it say for CBS to come in clear and you surf the other channels during a commercial break when you come back to CBS you have to twittle with the antenna again to get it to come in clear even though you never touched it when surfing through the other channels. The non powered rabbit ears with the halo works just as well.The positive is that Amazon's price was a lot less expensive than the competitions."

1918,1,"I bought a used copy of this lens .. perhaps that is part of the problem but I am less than thrilled with it.I like the fact that it is fast. I love photographing in low light. But, even in medium light, this lens struggles to focus and it is not sharp at all. My 18-55mm kit lens kicks it's butt for IQ. It is one of those lenses that you use only on rare occasions and mostly leave it on a shelf at home. I will probably not use this one very much as I have several old manual focus lenses that are far better that this lens. From now on, Sigma is a lens that I will avoid. I know some people have had good luck with their lenses but there are a lot of people out there complaining about the inconsistent quality. Its just not worth the risk to me."

1925,2,"Garmin Bicycle Mount for eTrex and Summit (010-10267-00)At first, I thought it was all good. Then while on a ride I noticed the Etrex rattling in the mount. Upon close inspection, it was not tight as the original back. Plus the original back is coated with rubberized material. Which makes it a fairly water tight and snug fit. The replacement back is just plastic. NO rubberized coating, and thus no water proofing and no tight fit. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the quality of the product. I had to use 'plastic' black tape around the opening to stop the rattle. But there is no protection from water.I don't understand why the inside of the back was not designed to have either a gasket or rubberizing to protect it from water.But that being said. It is still the only option for mounting it to the handle bar of a bike. And that job, is well done. Good heavy duty mounting, with lots of extra rubber spacers."

1927,2,"Pretty good small bag. Although a little tight for the camera body since it is positioned near the top where the pack is curved, there is plenty of padding and a tight fit does not cause any harm to the camera. The pads wear a little and the fit gets better over time, so this is not really a big deal, but it did make me worry initially. The padded velcro dividers in the bag can be positioned just about anywhere to make any combination of compartments. The bag also has a ton of extra pockets and compartments that were able to handle all my storage media, cables, batteries, etc. I have room for the camera, two other lenses, and the lens hoods on the inside. I am still trying to figure out if I can include my compact conventional film camera in the bag somewhere. Another great thing about the design of the pack is that the bag readily accepts other velcro attached accessories for water bottles, film, or other gear. I may see if my other camera will fit that way. There are two issues that might be a problem. 1 for the pros is that the bag is too small to handle larger lenses and professional gear. 2 for the beginner is that it is 1/2 the size of a regular backpack and not as convenient as a plain 35mm camera case if you are just headed out to the family picnic. One general gripe is that the straps will defninitely be a pain for those that prefer to carry it as a tote rather than wear it. They are not detachable. If they were, this would be nearly perfect for my needs. That said, I'm pretty happy with it and I won't be looking for any other cases."
1928,2,"If you don't mind looking like you should be listening to a Tears for Fears cassette on your enormous Walkman, these are fantastic especially for the price.

Regretfully, I had to replace it with another brand even though the rest of my theatre system is all Bose. (I even have Bose 161s throughout my home.) Their other speakers are excellent.  Bose just does not seem to achieve the realism in their center channel speakers that they are so famous for in their other equipment."

However, for some reason now the left earphone has barely any sound coming through it and it seems like something regarding the sound on this side is broken ALREADY after only 3 weeks of use. Not sure if this has anything to do with it but the cord is already twisted hellishly bad, I was so very careful with these and did not move around when using them but they twisted into a pile of garbage within the first 2 weeks of use, which is not acceptable - signs of poor quality wires used, I had this problem with some other cheap headphones I purchased but not my $25 Sony headphones which I may go back to after this.

They are inexpensive, and come with a ""limited"" lifetime warranty.As far as sound quality, it is very good.  More importantly, they block all background noise so that I can actually hear the music when I'm sitting at the back of a bus or in a noisy location.  I prefer to listen to music at a quiet volume and it's nice not to have to blast my eardrums out just to hear the music.  The fit is very secure, which I also like (I always felt like my iPod-style headphones were going to fall out of my ears)."
1941,1,"I've given this portable EQ a split rating of three stars for a couple of reasons which I'll briefly explain.I'm a professional sound recordist. So I do know sound gear. I didn't buy this to use professionally but to help improve the listenability of audio teaching tapes that I'm having to listen to with online classes. Some of these recordings were done thirty years ago and are terrible as far as the audio quality is concerned. A couple you can hardly understand what is being said.So I bought this little inline EQ just to help with trying to make these old teaching sessions easier to listen to. For that purpose, the Koss EQ50 works just fine.It is a three band EQ so that makes it limited in how much boost you'll get and where it will give it. The three faders are labeled Bass, Mid and Treble and that's pretty much where they are.You plug your device into the input, and your buds or headphones into the output. Pretty simple. And it works pretty good for an inexpensive booster. Now for the rest of the story.The way these devices work is that not only does it have a master volume control, but three individual volume controls. That's what the faders are, volume boosts or cuts at specific frequencies. So this little unit has a total of four volume controls. The noise that others have complained about is real, and much of it is post master fader, in what can be called the final section. There is a direct correlation between the amount of power a device uses and the signal-to-noise ratio. In laymen's terms, the more power a device can get, the quieter it is. If a device is built to use the minimum amount of power, it's likely to be noisy. It's more complicated than that but suffice it to say, this little EQ's chip doesn't use much juice at all so it can get noisy.The only thing you can do is try to pump as much volume into the device as you can before you overload the input. That way, you'll induce less noise through the faders. But since the main noisiness is post master volume, there's not a lot you can do about it overall.So my recommendation is this: if you need a booster for something like listening to transcriptions, or old muddy sounding radio shows, or old teaching tapes, this unit may work fine for you. If you are wanting something to boost your Walkman or iPod volume, and still want to hear music the way it's supposed to sound, you should probably look to other devices."
1942,0,"Put this on a wooden table and the case will mar and scratch your table. Not cool.It's very cheaply made; may look professional from a distance but it's likely to come apart if it falls of the airport luggage truck. Also, next time I'll buy something without PIC foam and just pay to have the foam sculpted. Other than that, it works. Might be good value for the money for someone getting started on photo or video or for someone that needs to carry semi-precious equipment around."
1943,1,"First modem was dead out of the box. On it's way back to Amazon now with a replacement on the way to me. Couldn't get it to synch with Cox Cable in Northern VA. I worked with Cox support...tried cycling power, re-provisioning, unplugging for hours...nothing. When the installer guy hooked up his (Toshiba) modem, it synched immediately. After two days of trying to synch my Linksys, I decided it was dead.Also...Wish Linksys would re-label the lights. Seems a bit confusing the way it is (see earlier reviews). My ""cable"" light never stayed lit (like you would assume it should)...but regardless...I couldn't get an IP address from their DHCP server. I have confidance in Linksys products, so I still give this modem 3/5 stars. I'm sure the next one will work fine (*crossing fingers*)."
1944,2,"This item works very well and gives provides convenient volume control for headphones, portable speakers, IPODs, etc.  Easy to use, I highly recommend them."
1945,2,"I used this speaker set for more than half a year now, and it served me great.  The sound quality is good (don't expect hi-fi quality sound, of course).  The sub-woofer is sounds great, too.  At the back it can accept 2 line input, so I can connect my 2 PC to the same box w/o problem.  Generally, it is a very good computer speaker."
1946,1,"We bought this for a 16-hour round trip vacation and it worked flawlessly for the probably 10 hours we used it in total. We were impressed. That said, upon returning home and trying to use it on trips around town, it has now started making rattling noises...as they all eventually seem to at one time or another. I don't want to turn up the music loud enough to overcome the rattling, so it has gone in the trash."
1947,1,"I didn't realize when buying these headphones why they were billed as ideal for DJ use (I'm not a DJ). The reason is that they have the world's longest cable--about 10 feet, I think. I ended up gathering up the excess cable and putting a rubber band around it--very clumsy. Also bad, the 2 cables from the headphones going down to the Y get all tangled up no matter what I do. I get so frustrated with these headphones that I deliberately treat them rough, hoping they'll break and I'll have an excuse for getting a better pair.Their performance with music is fine; no complaints."
1948,0,"Big problems with the CD player, just makes noises all the time, doesn't work at all, won't open. Nice small system, CD kills it."
1949,0,"I bought this for the same reason that everyone else does - so that I can be on a call and still take notes, etc.  The fit of the headset is a bit snug and the adjustment does not help a lot.  Ear pad is covered in some sort of 'pleather' material that is warm when on the ear for any extended period.  I am sure this will not be very comfortable in the summer months.  My only frame of comparison is a Plantronics set that I used at work for several years.  There IS no comparison really!  I guess that for the price, you can't expect too much, so I gave this 2 stars for that reason alone.  Everyone that I talk to says that my voice is reasonably clear and I can hear pretty well in the speaker of the set.  All the same, I think that next time I will just go back to Plantronics."
1950,2,"We ordered these for our new apartment and, I must confess, I put off using them for a month or so, because I was worried they would be a nightmare to install. Not at all! It couldn't be simpler. You've got to think strategically about where you want cords to go, and plan out before you cut, but once you do, thread them through, peel off sticky, and done.If I have one caveat, it's that you have to be careful with how many cords you put in each tube, unless it's just vertical from the device to the floor. Horizontal or diagonal tubes that have heavy cords in them, we found the weight of the cords is stronger than the adhesive.It's a nice solution and not a very difficult one to use. Well worth the money, to make all those cords a little less unsightly."
1951,0,"I bought this along with an RCA female to 3.5mm male adapter so that I could hook my headphones up to my PS3 and play without bothering my cousin or mom.Unlike other reviewers, the jacks did fit into the coupler.But like other reviewers, I only got audio out of the left channel.The black plastic grip was also severely cracked and splitting when I received the item, but I can look past that, since it's only a problem of aesthetics.It serves its purpose, albeit poorly; I can play without disturbing the other occupants of my house. Maybe mine is just a defective unit; I'll probably buy another later and update this review when I do."
1952,0,"I'm happy and I'm disappointed. I'm happy I didn't buy the big sister to this lens. Not at 4 times the cost of this lens. From f1.8 to about f4.0 this lens is almost useless. I know, I know, a lot of people have shots posted here that they like at 1.8, but if you could blow them up to 100%, you'd see what we used to call grain and is now referred to as noise. This lens eats light for breakfast, and little into lunch. I use a Canon T1i, by no means a slouch of camera. At first I thought there might be something wrong with the lens I received, but there doesn't seem to be. I was invited to take some pictures of people in a hospice. Until I mounted my 430xi II flash, the pictures, almost all shot indoors, were fine to the naked eye, but if you take them up to 100%, they granulate. Adding the flash, http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Speedlite-II-Digital-Cameras/dp/B001CCAISE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286808573&sr=8-1, a great unit by the way, took all the worry about shooting inside. I've noticed quite a few people bragging about their shots, but the depth of field is so shallow, you have to be right on top of it to get your subject in focus. Again, I thought this might be just me,so I went to a couple of respected lens reviews and lo and behold, they had the same comments. The f1.8 and the 1.4 both suffer at low light levels. Now, one of the reasons I suspect that many people buy a lens like this is to shoot in low light without a flash. Which is good, and I understand the desire/necessity of doing this, but you should realize that without a bright source of light, you're usable focus area at f1.8 on this lens and on the 1.4, will be about the size of a quarter on a 4x6"" print. The sites report the same findings I found in my every day, unscientific, shooting. You need light, lots of it, to really shoot pictures with this lens. If you need to enlarge them at all, you should be at least at f5.6. Once I was outside and able to get the lens closed down to f8, the lens rocks. I used the flash as a fill and it really balanced out the picture. I will use the lens in special circumstances, but not as my walking around lens."
1953,1,I didn't have to use it. This spring I'll use it  for exterior speakers.. It is still a good investment as the price of metal goes up and will come in handy.
1954,2,"We just purchased the Meade 90 ETX telescope and decided to get the computer controller too - and man are we glad that we did.  We're novices with the telescope, so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challenge.With the autostart, after taking about 15 minutes to go through the alignment process, we can just tell the Autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us.  Without this, the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moon.NOTE: If you're not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky (i.e. planets, etc), then you don't need the Autostar."
1955,2,"Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3This is a greatb tool for the macro shooter or slow shutter speeds. Very usefull also when you need to lock the mirror up for less noise.The only draw back is the short cord. Would be much better if it were longer, maybe 6' or more for different applications."
1956,1,"I thought that I made a good deal when buying this from the seller.  Although I knew it was used, it still gave me problems shortly after the purchase.  It tended to skip repeatedly when playing various DVDs.  I really liked the Apex DVD Players, I was very disappointed in this product purchase."
1957,2,"The first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly. There can be no denying it. The weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly, ugly, ugly. That said, these are easily the most comfortable portables I've worn, a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly. Additionally, the sound is good. I don't feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest, but the sound is very good. If you listen to a lot of Jazz or classical, some senns might serve you better. If you listen to more rock and hip hop, you'll be pleased with the portapros, if only for the comfort, which is truly exceptional. I use them with my iPod, and am well pleased."
1958,0,"Straight out of the box, I had no trouble installing the keyboard to my Sony Vaio laptop, but the mouse could not be installed without uninstalling my touchpad...screw that.  The keyboard worked for a few days, then the computer forgot who the keyboard was.  Every time I tried to re-recognize the keyboard, it caused my laptop keyboard to turn off and a system restore to a pre-bluetooth desktop time was the only way to get it back.  It never recognized the keyboard again.  I was able to find my tungsten pda with the transceiver, but once found and authenticated, there was nothing that could be done with it, unless confirming that it exists is important to you.  After completely removing all vestiges of this product from my computer and starting anew in hopes that the thing would work like it did the first time, it still did not work.  Finally I installed it on my Dell desktop computer.  Had no trouble authenticating the mouse, but the wizard for the keyboard would not work.  After much frustration and tinkering long into the night, I discovered that you could go in to the control panel and click on wireless link in ""printers and other hardware"" and search for the keyboard.  Once found, choose ""this device does not require authentication"", and it will work fine.  So far I have had no further issues, but I am terrified every time I sit down that I will end up engaged in another hours long struggle with my computer.  I am going to buy the logitech RF wireless setup for my laptop.  I hear its a breeze to set up."
1959,0,This type of Sony headphone were my favourite to use - they stuck deep in my ear and had great sound. But the last pair I bought hardly clung to my ear and the sound quality was horrendous.
1960,2,"I own some high end cans and I.E.M.'s. These were bought as a walk around the house headphone. The big thing is: How does Koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone? I wish Koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer, but if you need the best for what these cost, go no further!!! Be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band. They're light, comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressure.I love em!!"
1961,0,Save your money and buy the more expensive Hoya SUPER HMC Haze UV(0) filter. This filter ruined my precious vacation photos. stay away from this.
1962,2,This volume control is just what I needed to control the volume for headphones I own without a volumecontrol.  The control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smooth.
1963,2,This is definitely worth it if your a beginner or just a hobbyist but even if your a season pro it has it's advantages.  I bought this bag about ten years ago and I still swear by it. I will agree with most of the other users in that it's small and cumbersome to a point.  You have to think open about this though. It makes you think what you really need therefore eliminating clutter and making hiking much more manageable.  Also it's great for metropolitan work in that it looks like a regular bag. It won't be so obvious to prying eyes to what you have therefore making yourself less of a target unless your carrying a tripod with you.
1964,0,"I bought this camera for the trip to Europe. The whole idea was trying to find something small for under...By holdding it, this camera feel perfectly small. All control buttons seems logical and user friendly. The monitor is bright and clear. The camera egonomic is exellent ( fit perfectly in my palm). The camera use the Digital Video recording system, so I just assume that the picture quality is exellent. That all the good things, but here the downfall. This camera has the worst picture quality I of all the camcorders I have ever own, the image stablelizer is useless, download to the computer was the nightmare . The kits came with the USB cable but you can use it to download still photos only (no memory card is supplied). To download video to the computer you have to use the firewire cable and Video capture software (not suplying with the kits). Not a lot of choice, I use the old fashion way to dubb to my VHS tape using the VCR. The result is...my old Sony analog camcorder has better picture quality than that thing. I sold my Sony TRV720 to get this thing , well bad mistake!!! It would be a great deal if this camera had the Sony brain and picture quality. Well make your wise decision..."
1965,2,"Bought four sets of these phones for $25 apiece on the Amazon website.  This price is 1/2 of the MSRP!  I have owned Porta-Pros for nearly 30 years. Just recently, I had the chance to compare them with super high end 'phones costing $350 and $1350(!).  Both were over the ear models.  While these pricey 'phones delivered superb sound,  the difference from the Koss 'phones, in my opinion did not justify spending 12 to 40 times as much money!  More importantly,  the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable, in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head, and so severe  that I had to reach for the bottle of Motrin.  By contrast, the Koss 'phones, with adjustable ear pressure, are supremely comfortable.  I can wear them for hours without any problems.  Finally, Koss stands by their lifetime guarantee- no questions asked, even if you mistakenly sit on them.  In summary,  you absolutely will love this headphone.  Even the Stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible price/performance ratio of this stellar product.  Unconditionally recommended!"
1966,2,"I just got these in the mail today. I wanted something cheap with decent quality. The sound quality from these headphones is amazing. I can't attest to the durability of them since I just got them, but wow, the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion. They are kind of dorky looking though."
1967,0,"My elderly Mom purchased this radio perhaps 6 or so years ago from CCrane.  It worked well initially, however, about a year or two ago it started to fail on her.The LCD display only 1/2 works and the switches along the top need to be pressed so firmly her arthritic hands can't do it anymore.It now sits in the closet gathering dust.  She has some cheapo drug store radio by her bedside so she can listen to her AM radio shows at night.Other far cheaper radios and electronic devices have faired much better than this $159 has.  It was great while it was new but not so great anymore.PS:  The TV band does not exist anymore so that feature is useless too on her radio..."
1968,2,"This is a great economical flash for the amatuer photo enthusiest. I found it a little difficult to figure out, but once I did it became my favorite accessory. I use it with a Canon t3i and my photos are great. I recommend that a diffuser be purchased along with the flash. I purchased an Opteka SB-1 Mini Universal Studio Soft Box Flash Diffuser and it works great. Just be careful not to drop. I unfortunately did this and had several pieces fall off. Luckily, all but one snapped right back in place. The other was a silver disc that was super glued on the side opposite the manual computer. I put it back with a much better glue. The flash still works great with only a couple scratches."
1969,2,Very comfortable. great tone and bass sounds. sound isolations is great!!!they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buy.
1970,1,I purchased this camera on sale with rebates and paid much less than retail.  The camera operates fine for me but the quality of the picture is not very good.  If you have bright lighting it works fine although it is tough to get it to look focused unless what you are capturing is very close to the camera. The software that comes with it allows you to take snapshots and video clips.  It provides software to broadcast your webcame to the world but you will need to eventually pay for a spotlife account and this is the only option given by the software.  If you are buying this to just let the kids mess around and make little video clips or just for instant messenger duty it will work fine.  Just don't purchase for the retail price!  FIY - I have mine hooked to a HP N5495 PIII 1.06 GHZ 512 MB Win XP Home laptop.  For the price I paid I'm satisfied with the results of this average beginner webcam.
1971,2,"It made the cables going to my TV look much more professional. I was barely able to fit a power cord, hdmi cable and a coaxial cable. The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was the corner u shaped piece and the T piece, was a little tricky to install. You will not be disappointed with this product."
1972,0,"The sound quality is pretty good, but these headphones are not loud. Even with the player's volume and the headphone volume switch all the way up, it is not loud enough for me. That's probably due to the on-ear rather than in-ear design that I'm used to with buds. Also, if you're hoping for something to drown out noise, this is not for you. I hope they work for me on the airplane to drown out white noise, but I'm skeptical that they will. Also, those around you can easily hear what you are listening to. I wouldn't buy them again. You get what you pay for, right?"
1973,2,The remote switch works as it should and gives you enough cord length to avoid moving the camera when you wish to use it.
1974,0,"This card was purchased because I had a coupon making this what I thought was a very good deal.  I was wrong.I've installed a lot of wireless cards and this one was just terrible.  I followed their directions to the letter and it just kept telling me that it had associated with the AP but couldn't find the network or the Internet.  OK, I finally used the profile page to enter all the settings manually (IP, DNS, Gateway, you get the idea) and it connected immediately.  However, I shouldn't have had to do that.It turns out that the IP address the card was trying to use didn't come from my router.  I have no idea where it was getting it (nearby unsecured linksys router?)Once configured, the card has a tough time holding a solid network connection at what I deem a reasonable distance.IMO there are better cards out there."

1976,0,"I loved my ipod, for however long the battery lasted, but as i began charging it and leaving it until my next use, it began depleting its own battery without any use.  It has now been 3 weeks, and my iPod holds a full charge for about an hour WITH OUT TURNING IT ON!  My only choice is to return my iPod to Apple, and they want MONEY!! even though it is still in the warrenty.  I Highly recommend opting for another mp3 player, as this one costs more than mosts, offers great everything but battery.  If you always have a plug within 2 feet of you, you might not have this problem, but for most of us, the point of this is to take us AWAY from plugs, and computers."
1977,0,"Pure crap.  To think, the $11 I spent ($6 + $5 s&h) plus another sawbuck could have purchased a case of PBR in cans."
1978,0,"The product picture and part number match, but they together do not math the description."
1979,0,"I purchased this KVM switch about 5 months ago or so, and it has always given me a flaky performance.  Switching between my laptop and desktop has been very intermittent in performance: sometimes it switches, sometimes it doesn't.  Also sometimes the scroll lock key doesn't respond when you hit it twice to make it switch between machines.  To make it work I have to unplug the switch from all my devices then plug them all back in.  It is a very big pain in the rear!  Also when I boot up only one machine it doesn't like that.  It seems to like it better if you boot up both machines, ack!  I hope this thing is under warranty; if not I will go with a different manufacturer.  I am very disappointed with this Linksys product!"
1980,0,"The connections, both at the plug and the jack, are not built to spec and are quite loose in all of the headphone jacks and headphones I've tried.  Any movement of the cable causes the connection points to slip and slide, causing one or both channels to drop out or cause static to be heard.Very disappointing and the cable is going into the garbage because it would cost more than I paid originally to return it."
1981,0,"The Axim has a bug that even Dell customer support will grudgingly confirm. Sometimes the unit will stay on after you power it off and slowly drain down the battery.  After a few times of this, the reserve battery drains as well, and POOF! no more data.happens to me on my Axim. No software fix yet."
1982,2,"I didn't know much about this brand called 'Koss'. I just simply bought this since they looked very portable, light-weight, cool, and contain some bass. Apparently, this headphone almost sounds as good as my 200 dollar Beats by bull(___) HD.For a price of 40 and the incredibly small size, this headphone is simply amazing. Bass is reasonable enough, though some House music, metal, or dubstep can make the bass sound all mixed-up and rather disgusting than clear; however, if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around 300-400 or even higher :). Other than that, I didn't find any part of its sound quality less than I expected. Besides, I didn't even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphone!I use this whenever I am doing some exercise, and so far I find no need to buy another earphone or a light-weight-on-ear headphone.Great job Koss, I just simply love this. XD"
1983,2,"I don't understand all the negative reviews about this changer. I've owned this changer for about 6 months now, and find it more than suitable for casual use.  My previous 5 disc changer was a Kenwood CD-203 (purchased in 1998); I also own a Pioneer 301 disc changer.  Before purchasing this changer, I was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here.  I bit the bullet, as my Kenwood changer was acting up, and I am quite happy with this product.This changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues.  I use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver, and the quality is excellent.  The remote works even with sloppy angles.  The changer is quiet when changing CDs (rotating the carousel), and the display is readable from across the room.There are a few little quirks:  The changer differentiates between 'exchanging' a CD (thus not interrupting the currently playing CD, and not opening the drawer all the way) and 'open', which stops the current CD and opens the drawer.  Personally, I find the distinction a little annoying, since I almost always want to 'exchange'.  My previous Kenwood has no such distinction.I also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sight--I like to listen to music in low light or even darkness, so I had to memorize some of the remote buttons (In particular, 'disc skip' is located in the middle of the remote).However, these are extremely minor nits.  The changer is excellent, feels sturdy, and has survived about 600 hours of use in the last 6 months.  I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer."
1984,0,"I saw another reviewer was able to use this with his Windows 8 laptop, but in my experience it wouldn't work.  I was hoping it would be &#34;plug and play&#34; with my Lenovo Yoga but the drivers never loaded properly.  I downloaded the drivers from the Trendnet web site too, but they didn't work either.  I found a chart on the Trendnet site that marks this ethernet adapter as &#34;TBD&#34; (to be determined) with Windows 8, so perhaps it will eventually work, but meanwhile I'm returning it for another adapter that advertises Win8 compatibility."
1985,0,"I purchased my Minolta Dimage 7Hi new 2 years ago.  Performance was fine up until two weeks ago when the camera's EVF and LCD displays went completely black (no images displayed). Contacted Sony (where you now have to go for Minolta service) as instructed and found that the base flat rate for repair was $211 plus $22 shipping. They got me once, but they won't get me twice!MadMax"
1986,1,"I don't think it really makes a lot of sense to buy some really expensive piece of equipment to play 30 year old tapes.  They are going to sound pretty bad regardless.  So this deck does the trick.  It is inexpensive, and seems to be a sturdy reliable deck.  As others have stated though, the omission of a remote control is kind of shocking, and unforgiveable in this day and age."
1987,2,"Excellent as a backup flash. You must be aware that it is hard to have anyone honor the warranty since apparently Vivitar is no longer in business. If that concerns you, go with the real McCoy and get a brand name flash."
1988,1,"The speakers do sound good for 2.1 computer speakers.  Slightly better for music than the Logitech Z-2300 set which I've had longer than these.The build quality is where they lose the battle. These are some fragile speakers.They began crackling and popping, no matter what (if any) signal was going to them.  Then I started to notice the smell of burning electronics coming from the left satellite (the one with the controls).Will definitely be the last Klipsch product I purchase."
1989,0,"It's small, well built, good sound quality, easy to operate, and light weight. My biggest serious problem with it is that it has a serious channel drift problem: the program gets interrupted or weakened often when I walk or turn or move the radio from one pocket to another. This is a very serious problem for a portable radio. The other one is that the station dial is too imprecise. With the channel drift, I have to fiddle with the dial all the time to get back to my station, which is not easy to do with this particular dial... I ended up throw mines away. My wife uses it in her work place which is located at a high ground and she said the reception is great. So guess the drift problem is because of the weak signal. But still, for my use, it's not very helpful."
1990,0,"The picture quality of this webcam is best described as one you might expect from a low-end webcam you bought 2-3 years ago! Very disappointing and the extra features as a digital camera/video clip camera are only frills to hide this fact. With picture quality so bad, none of the extra features matter anyway.I absolutely would recommend buyers to look at other alternatives. If you receive this as a gift, see if you can return it to the store!!"
1991,0,"I really like this device when I first got it because it was a plug and go device.  However, 8 months later, one of the ports has failed.  None of the devices I plug into this port work on that port, but they work on the other ports.  The warranty is only 90 days and I will now need to get another device."
1992,1,"I found the quality of the picture and sound to be very high, and the combination of features first rate. However, given the choice again, I would not purchase this combination model. In two years, I have had to have the set serviced twice because the DVD player suddenly 'went dead,' and my usage of DVDs is less than once a month."
1993,0,"Be careful with this item, pins 1 and 8 come disconnected intentionally. You can clearly see in the receptacle that pins 1 and 8 are bended downward. This is a 6-pin coupler sold as an 8-pin coupler, unbelievable."
1994,2,"I listen to Rock (Stones, Bruce, Led Zep, Doobies, Kate Bush, Eurythmics, etc.) and tons of Classical -- lots of Beethoven, but also choral (Rutter and P&auml;rt) and Baroque (Handel and Bach) and especially piano concertos. I discovered Jazz about two years ago and listen to much Bill Evans and Miles and Tord Gustavsen. I own Grado 225 headphones, NAD CD player, and a nice Yamaha-powered music setup with Paradigm speakers. What's my favorite listening experience? My iPhone with these Koss Porta-Pros! On my second pair now and always keep a spare pair in the study in case I ever lose these Porta-Pros. Bass is fantastic and mids perfect. I would boost the treble a bit to match the purity of my Grados, but nothing can touch the bang-for-buck experience of these Koss 'phones. Greatest experience for rock music. I'm loving them more every day. Not just great portable headphones -- they are amazing headphones, period. Buy now."
1995,2,"Very nice little gadget that makes taking photos so much easier while the camera is on the tripod.  I do wish it was easier to see the on/off switch, (the switch is black and written with black lettering on a black remote), and would be nice if the shutter release button was better situated, but overall this is a very convenient, handy little remote for the Xsi"
1996,1,"I got this device at a huge discount. There was a 50-dollar rebate, and I found it cheaper somewhere else, so the store marked it down according to their price match policy. Ironically, after all that, it was still a bit more then than it is currently.The device has works perfectly when I connect it through the USB2 PCI card I bought for it, and I have almost 1GB of personal data files stored. That feature was one of the factors in buying it. I like the over all quality of the product, but it lacks some essentials, and other features are buggy.PLUS:* Good sound and power conservation control.* Sturdy design, so far no damage after three short-distance drops.* Easy interface with Windows - I've hardly had to use the ""Safely Disconnect"" dialog, just plugging and unplugging at will.* Decent sound quality and controls, though it could use a noise filter for known MP3 sound degradation (does this exist on other players?)* Reasonable price* Records on-the-fly to MP3 via built-in mic or line-in. Nice feature, though I haven't used it much.MINUS* Manual misses some key points of device operation. Five languages, mediocre coverage.* Some display/navigation glitches.* High storage load can cause slow-down in load-up and button response. Also causes inconsistent freezes and sound errors. Defrag may potentially help this problem.* Housing back seems kinda thin, making me nervous that the whole drive could break out if dropped hard enough.* No further firmware development (as told to me by Archos support).* Only supports MP3 - no WMA or OGG, and MP3Pro is compatible, but sounds nasty and causes even more errors.* Not very useful for Linux users. Can read from the device, but writing is dangerous and could lock up Linux. Of course, this is true of most players.* File naming for on-the-fly recording is really difficult and cumbersome.* Could use more display area. As large as the device is, the screen could be bigger. Hard to sift through the hundreds of albums I've stored (even in a folder hierarchy) when I can only see five at a time.Another reviewer mentioned a car adapter. Which is fine if you have a tape deck, but if you have a CD player and need to use an FM transmitter to play through the car stereo, you're out of luck. This device isn't compatible with the ones I've found.This drive does the job for me, and until I can afford something higher-end, it'll serve my purposes. But if you can afford it, pay the higher price for a better player. I'll be looking to sell mine once I can put together money for something else."
1997,0,"I just listened to ""Frankenstein"" by Edgar Winter on this radio. It is stereo. Maybe not the greatest stereo separation, maybe it's my brain, but my belief that it is FM mono was incorrect.I will add that I bought this for my wife to listen to when she is walking, and she won't use it as she says the stations fade in and out. We are 25 miles from L.A. so the reception is pretty good.Original review:The item description is incorrect. It says AM/FM Stereo Radio. When you look at the radio itself, it says ""FM/AM"". It only has FM mono and AM. The description should be corrected. The sound is OK for mono, but that's a lot different from stereo. I haven't listened to the AM."
1998,2,use headphones with the speaker output on my tv. There is no volume control on that output. added this inline before my headphones. Works perfect.
1999,2,The Canon RC1 is a great remote if you are aligned directly in front of the sensor.  Or maybe the battery is weak? The nice thing is that I can store the RC1 directly on the shoulder strap of my Rebel XTi.
2000,0,"I bought the DWL-G650 card (Version B4) along with the the 624 Router (Version C1) a few days ago.  The installation was very easy.  The install guide was the best I ever read.Only one problem, it didn't work.  For some reason, I could not get a signal on my laptop with the DWL-G650 card.  Several calls to D-Link did not solve the problem.  Though the D-Link people are great and their e-mail service is also great, I still could not hook-up.D-Link told me to send the product back to Amazon since they believe it is either a bad router or a back card.I'll change the star rating once I get this product to work.  But it deserves at least 2 stars for the great install guide and the helpful people at D-Link.UPDATE:  After more converstaions with the D-Link tech suport people, they concluded that the problem was with the latest firmware update (2.48) to this wireless card.  When I use the prior firmware update 2.46, I have no problems hooking up with my Di-624 wireless router.  HOWEVER, firmware update 2.46 has a WPA bug.  So if you are willing to use 2.46 w/out the WPA encryption, this is a great product.  The speed is amazing.Otherwise, you may consider the Linksys w/speedboast."
2001,2,"This is something you probably won't fully appreciate until you've had one for a while and then lose it. You may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control. But once you get used to having one, you'll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming. The one I lost was in daily use for 3 or 4 years and continued to work well."
2002,2,"I could only give this Vivitar four stars because it does everything very well, but it takes a LOT of practice to learn how to use it WELL! Once one learns how to use it, it is a really useful all-round flash and a good addition to a multi-flash system. Considering the price, well worth it."
2003,2,"I own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a 3rd pair for Christmas. Great sound, lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores. Unlike earbuds, they stay in place. They are not indestructible- if you accidentally step on them, you will break them. But they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tear.Highly recommended."
2004,1,"Yes, the cord is short.  But I got around that by using this laptop mouse with my laptop, which I thought was creative of me.  And my mouse hasn't broken, either.  Nothing special...just a slightly-smaller-than-most-mouses portable mouse.  Certainly a better choice than the twice-as-expensive Kensington Pocket Mouse Pro (with the nifty-sounding retractable cable), which, like other Kensington products, broke on me hours out of the box.  So, Belkin.  Good enough."
2005,1,"It's pretty decent for the price. The sound quality is great, but to be honest, I'm not an audiophile. I was mainly looking for a really comfortable headphone so I could keep it for a long time while at work.Unfortunately, this didn't turn out to be the set. I can only keep these phones on for maybe half an hour, then it starts bothering me."
2006,0,"I could not agree more on the issue brought up here. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good..Update: It seems most people didn't appreciate my comments years ago, but now even Fuji agrees with me as their newer cameras I saw were using sD. Y'all are just hatin' on a prophet!!"
2007,0,"Canon generally makes excellent lenses, but my copy of this lens is awful!  Even at f/8 with a fast shutter speed and low ISO, images are blurry when blown up to 100%.  It also suffers from severe CA, particularly in bright settings.  Yes, this lens is inexpensive, but I can't recommend it at any price.  You would do much better to save your money and buy a better lens.Canon should pull the 28mm f/2.8 off the market."
2008,2,"I would give it 5 stars if I could use this on my bike that has > 1"" handlebar diameter.  There is no oversize version.I had to cut some of the plastic insert and insert my own to make it fit and not slip.Took a little work to get the screw into the nut (sounds crazy, but yes - it can be a little tricky if not closed flush)."
2009,0,"Sometimes you just know that a product is going to be a disaster, and sometimes you know it will be a delight.  Alas, I quickly started getting 'disaster' vibes - even during the installation process with the D-Link DBT-120.The installation (onto my XP Professional OS Dell laptop) was different on screen than suggested by the user guide on the CD and Quick Install Guide.  A bad start.  It required two reboots during the course of the install - surely unnecessary with Win XP.  And, most objectionable of all, I had to key in a 32 character security code to 'register' the software - how stupid is that?Anyway, eventually I got it installed and working, but it was very difficult to understand or use.  For example, what do you think that an 'Object Push Link' is?  Whatever it is, I have two of them now!The software would occasionally generate error messages that sometimes didn't seem to mean anything, and other times probably did!Anyway, after a month of not using it, I needed to use it again with my Nokia 3650.  But when I went to use it, I could no longer get the devices to communicate, and after speaking with T-Mobile's helpful customer support, we identified the problem - a missing D-Link driver.So, I called D-Link's misnamed customer 'support'.  After 3.5 hours on the phone (sure, with several disconnects during that time) and speaking with four different people, none of whom could solve my problem, a supervisor interrupted to say that it wasn't their responsibility to fix the missing D-Link driver so that it would talk to the outside world!!!  The 'level two' support person who'd been struggling to help me said he had to therefore end the call and couldn't help any more.  He suggested I place a message asking for help in a news group!The software interface is impossible to understand and when it doesn't work, you're on your own.  Unacceptable in all respects."
2010,1,"If there are typos in this message, it is ecause some of the keys on this very keyoard are dead now. However, I have been used to using a natural keyboard (gee the b and the x are back) and this one, aleit (dead again) wired, is the only game in town. Others are either ugly or not curved enough.Yet after only two years of regular use, it stops working properly. If there is another option to my liking, I'd definitely try others first."

2012,0,"I purchased a Hoya CIR-PL filter on Amazon.  I am an experienced photographer and can say with certainty that it doesn't work.  At all.  Regardless of position of the front element relative to the rear, there is no change in color, saturation, reflection, or any of the other criteria that circular polarizing lenses should correct or effect.  In one instance, I was able to take better reflection-free photos through a window with my iPhone than with my Canon EOS Rebel XTi, with the CIR-PL filter on either my EFS 18-55mm lens or EFS IS Ultrasonic 70-300mm lens.  In short, the two elements of the filter might as well be made of window glass. FWIW, this particular filter was manufactured in the Phillipines.I wrote to Hoya and am waiting to hear back.  I will update when and if I do."
2013,0,"These pens will write just fine on disks that don't have an unlabeled, mirror finish.  On those disks, however, the black ink turns light gray as it dries.  I did not try the other colors, but the other reviews are certainly discouraging.  What types of disks have mirror finishes?  I have two from different manufacturers, one of which is the archival quality, MAM-A 24K gold, the other being a generic disk from work.Unfortunately, the only reason I bought these pens was for use with the archival disks.  After all, I've been using Sharpie markers on disks since the invention of the recordable CD, and I've had very, very few ever fail after passing an initial test.  Since I was archiving a spare-time project that I had completed over 5 years, I wanted to do everything I could to preserve it -- thus the special disks (DvDs) and pens.  I did find one pen that works on the mirror-finish disks:Archival Gold CD/DVD Safe Pen Solvent Free.  These Archival Gold pens will occasionally have the same problem unless you scribble on a piece of paper first, which seems to make the ink flow better.  (I tried that with the Memorex pens, and it didn't work.)BTW, when I'm writing on disks, I try to keep some Purell or equivalent alcohol-based hand sanitizer close by, along with some tissue.  If you don't wait too long to apply it, Purell will remove markings from disks without a trace.  When working with archival-quality disks, you might just want to use ethyl alcohol, since it is recommended by archival disk manufacturers.  We can't forget that the name of the game here is to avoid depositing potentially damaging chemical residues on the disks!Don't shoot the messenger!Tim"
2014,0,"Don't buy these speakers, despite the attractive price, if you plan on using a cell phone anywhere near them. The interference is soo horrible, it makes this painfully loud and anoying buzzing/popping noise because they are not properly shielded by cell phone interference.Im mad that i got stuck with them but im going to buy a more expensive pair next time. definetly learned my lesson."
2015,0,"My PX200 arrived today. I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I tested it on my iPods (which was purchased for that purpose) and immediately requested an RMA from Amazon. Build wise it is decent, the storage case is quite clever, however, sound wise it was very unbalanced. It had nice high tone separation, decent color but the lower registers (bass) was missing a lot. It labels itself with 'Powerful Bass' which is deceiving; alas even my nephew's al-cheapo AKG K26P (though I must admit somewhat muddy and requires treble boosting) beat it any-day. Buy the AKG K81 DJ which is a way much better value for money in terms of sound compared to the PX200. Then again perhaps I prefer the AKG sound. I have the K141, K55, K81 DJ (which broke and the PX200 was a replacement), C1000s and like them all. Thank god that Amazon would take the Sennheiser PX200 back. I'm buying a new K81 DJ from Amazon to replace the old one."
2016,0,"This product works as advertised.  However there are facts you should be clued to.1) it suffers from FTP upload/download issues.  It cannot do large FTP transmits or receives without hanging.  This is a known problem having to do with some memory leak and their help desk's only response was ""well if you want to do that, you need to get something more robust"".  What an answer eh.2) the device has upgrade compatability issues.  Since my friend having gotten the above answer from their tech support, needed to upgrade in order to branch out into his new B2B FTP processes, he bought a good powered wireless VPN router.  But as one reviewer indicated, the WAP54G will only talk to others of its kind.  Indeed every setup option has a restrictive use complication.  Thus these access points did not work with his new router.  This means that when it comes time to upgrade, you cannot just go out and buy any old thing if your intent is to try and reuse these components elsewhere.  The new router works fine, but these devices refuse to talk to it.  The documentation confirms that indeed the linksys accesspoints won't talk to anything but others of their kind.  That means my friend must upgrade not only his wireless router, but also the wirless connection method used by his store front pcs, and also his router setup in his home office which also uses the related linksys product.  What should have been a 150$ fix is now a 600$ total replacement because these WAP54G are useless with any other equipment but themselves.3) it is slow compared to newer equipment.  The speed difference between the WAP54G and corresponding router, and the new VPN wireless router was dramatic; visually noticable.  Maybe this is a silver lining for my friend.  He si somewhat excited about the possible speed improvment he might see at his point of sale units.  The new router was painting internet screens very fast whereas the old liksys router was not in comparison.  I wish I could give a comparison of wireless PC performance so that I could comment on the actual performance of the WAP54G but since we could not get the wireless connection made to the new router what can I say.And before someone says that we never tuned the WAP54G setup, know that my friend had network professionals install and optimize the WAP54G equipment when it was initially purchased.  They came to his store and home office to do the setup.  It cost a few bucks but he was happy at the time to know it would all work.So to recap:0) works as advertised but...1) slow2) memory leaks3) upgrade incompatibleHail Flavius!"
2017,0,"This lock is poorly designed. Upon setting a new combination code and attempting to plug into my laptop, found it very hard to turn dials away from my code to engage the lock. Once removed from laptop, the lock somehow reset in the locked position and my code would no longer work. Followed all the directions. Also the lock is quite wobbly on the computer, even with the supplied spacers. Buy the Kensington keyed lock instead; you won't regret it."
2018,0,"I owned a 5 disc Sony player for at least a decade before seeking to upgrade, hence I assumed the quality was good based on prior personal experience. I also needed a recorder to play extended music playback for four to seven hours for office clientele. In short, I was sorely disappointed after loading 200+ CDs into this 300 CD changer. Consistent with the other reviews I've since seen for this this player lately (especially here at Amazon), it has at least three major flaws I have experienced: 1) It sporadically skips between discs in the middle of playback. 2) After 45 minutes of continuous play in the random play mode, you can count on it to stop playback and spin at high speed without resuming play. Resetting it or cutting it off results in an abrupt stop and an ominous screech, that I am sure will result in long term damage. This happens consistently, every 24 to 48 hours, regardless of length of use, i.e., two or three hours per day. 3)Worst of all, the player has begun throwing discs. 1-4 discs at a time are displaced into the rear left well recess-area behind the carousel. You must remove discs and rotate the carousel to a point where you can reach in and retrieve the discs by hand. Meanwhile, these discs 'clip' one another as the edges snap past each other when the carousel rotates.There is no problem with sound quality per se, and random play is acceptable (excluding interruptions, see above), although not totally random at times. However, reliability, functionality and ease of use do not apply to this unit as malfunctions escalate over time. Not to be too harsh, but its best use may be as a storage unit for your CD collection. Select a smaller unit, an alternate model or a different manufacturer for better performance; and do your due diligence in advance despite name brand reputation. P.S. note the tag suggestions for this product, none of which sent by me.Cornwall"
2019,2,"My Canon 1EG bag is stuffed, and I have a Canon 5D Mark II, two very small film bodies, and 4 lenses in my bag. There is no more room in the main compartment! It will not fit 2 bodies and 7-10 lenses plus a flash, unless you have extremely small lenses (that means no ""L"" lenses, guys!) And if you attach the hoods and keep them in their protective pouches, just forget about it. Nevertheless, I do not need any more room, so this bag is adequate. The strap can kind of be uncomfortable at times, but if you wear good clothes, you'll get over it quickly.This gets 4 stars, but Canon needs to make a larger bag for people that have a few telephoto L lenses."
2020,2,"In comparing the Koss PortaPro with the Sennheiser 201, which is a good deal cheaper (and also quite a bit bulkier), I've concluded that both headphones are amazing for the price, but they're quite different. The PortaPro has significantly more bass. I had to keep the volume at about 50% what I keep it at for the Sennheiser. The PortaPro is perfect if you're really into bass, if you're really into the beat. The Sennheiser is better for purity of sound. I just feel that, in general, it gives a truer, purer sound. The sound that the original artist had in his/her head. A lot of people will LOVE the beat on this. But some people will find it overpowering. I'm listening to ""Something"" by The Beatles right now, and I'm pretty sure George didn't want Paul's bass to dominate so much.Or maybe this is the best way to put it: you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing, you're struck by how great the surround sound is? It's so rich and bassy, you can practically feel your bones vibrate. That's what the Koss PortaPro is like. It's GREAT for watching movies. But it just doesn't give the purest vocal sound for music. If you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals, the bass will deafen you.The sound went out in one side after 6 months. The headphones lay on the shelf for a year, because I never got around to mailing it in for warranty (they'll replace it for you but it isn't free). And then I decided to fix it myself, so I got a new plug from Radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour. After 45 minutes I was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself. But finally I got it to work. And to keep it that way, I'm not going to use it on the move. I recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when you're moving around (the Sony MDR J10 is my favorite - it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand), and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home. As you move around, the wire bends in your pocket, and eventually the connection is severed.Oh, and I agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while. But I kind of think that's a good thing...it limits your headphone use and will probably save your hearing in the long-run. And you do have to learn how to take them off without them pulling out your hair."
2021,0,"I ordered this wireless router based on what other said about its quality. They were quite correct; it is well made.I ran into immediate problems, though, with the setup. Here's my situation:I have a Macintosh G4 and a BellSouth DSL connection. I'm adding a MacBook wireless connection using Mac OS internal Airport.The problem here is, probably, not with the technology. There is, however, a serious problem with the lack of installation documentation. I've Googled online and found dozens of people in my situation. Among Linksys, Bellsouth, Apple, there walls of insulation that make this setup far from simple.First, if linksys had provided a Macintosh setup CD it would have been a tremendous help. If I had been a wired geek, I probably could have called on my powers as a nerd to begin entering an endless string of IPs and DHCPs and PPoEs, etc. that need to be configured. I'm just a regular Joe user.Next, Bellsouth DSL, which I have used for years and like for its remarkable uptime abilities, provides no documentation whatsoever about making a wireless connection to its router. Not that I could find.Finally, Apple's Airport is friendly, but unprepared to bridge the gap between linksys and bellsouth.I expected plug and play, but got plop and play dead. This may well be my fault, but I need a white knight to make this thing right."

2024,1,"I loved everything about this mouse from the time I opened the box- except for the fact that the buttons are rather stiff, and my clicks often didn't register.  I'm returning it regretfully, because I like the fact that the two extra buttons can be programmed, and the general size and shape is good.I'd recommend it for people with medium to large hands, though.  It's just a bit big for someone with small hands.  It's definitely not for people who have arthritis or other problems with stiff buttons.  Most people would get used to them after a while I think."

2028,1,"First of all, these are well made and mostly well designed with places for pens and mesh panels so you can see where the insurance card and registration are located.  My only problem is that they're designed to hold a lot more than I intend to keep in them so the Velcro hooks on the strap don't match the loop material on the case unless you keep the case very loose.  If the hook half ran further down the strap it could be closed more securely.Nevertheless, I may order more for family."

The TLZ 10 has a smaller front pocket but inside the pocket there are two pouches.  Note, however, that the TLZ 10 will not accomodate as long a lens as will the TLZ Mini."
2030,0,"I bought this Linksys adapter for an Apple eMac whose ethernet port had been zapped by a lightning strike. The salesperson where I purchased it told me that Linksys offered Macintosh drivers on their web site; this was incorrect. However, because the technology used in all USB-to-Ethernet adapters is based on an industry standard, there are free third-party drivers available for download on the web that will allow your OSX Mac to use just about ANY of the USB-to-ethernet adapters on the market. I downloaded and installed a driver for OSX 10.3.9 from [...] and the Linksys USB200M works flawlessly on my eMac.HOWEVER, regarding the quality of this device...I wish I had read the other reviews on Amazon before buying the Linksys. I totally agree that it is very flimsy and poorly designed. When you open the little door on the side, the door itself creates a side to the jack where your ethernet cable will plug in. And the door is so flimsy (see the other reviews), that if it comes off, your cable will no longer stay attached. Plus, when you plug a cable into it, you get an awkward, stiff connection at a 45 degree angle. Fortunately, it does come with a short extension cable to make this connection more flexible for tight spaces. The removeable dust cap is pretty useless (does the USB plug really need to be protected?) The Linksys USB200M works on my Mac, but due to the poor design and construction, I can't give it more than 2 stars. There are plenty of other adapters on the market that can't fail in the ways the Linksys USB200M will by nature of it's poorly engineered door/socket."

2032,2,"These headphones are not only great for listening to music. But I bought them for playing electric guitar, piano, and violin thru them for prartice. The extra ohm ""60"" makes the diff over the 32 ohm ones on the market. I didn't want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour. These are feather lite and really can't even tell they are on your head. You line 6 Pod users or other multi effect users, well lover these. the extra ohm does make a diff in tone. No ice picking or high shrill. Rich bass and tone through out. Very pleased with them. As well as the tone for MP3's. Very rich tone all the way around. At 60 ohm you won't notice that much of a diff for mp3's. But for playing musical instruments thru them, the extra ohm makes a BIG diff in tone.Well be using these with my Line 6 Pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long. They are not like my Marshall Stack, but they excellent.I know my neighbors well love em.."
2033,2,"Works very well.  However, we wish the cord was longer so we could be farther away from the camera.  Also, not being able to hold the shutter open with the switch is disappointing."
2034,2,"A good little tool to have around the house, especially when gaming. I can plug this into the computer then my headphones into it, then adjust the volume from there without having to alt-tab to change the volume."
2035,1,"I've owned my HD 202s for about 3 months now and have logged about 30 hours of listening time. They've broken in a bit, and are slightly more bass-heavy than they were initially. Regardless, I'd rate sound quality as about average. These are better than most Sony et al. brands you can find at Target for around the same price point. However, there are a few much better options for slightly more. I had a set of Grado SR-60s that blew these things out of the water and were only marginally more expense. The HD 202s have a ""muddiness"" to the sound and lack clarity in vocals and guitar, so they aren't really ideal for rock music. Rap sounds okay, and the low end response is good. Keep in mind these are closed ear headphones, which can either be a good or bad thing. For one, they isolate the sound a bit, so if you use these in noisy environments they'll make your listening experience a bit more pleasant. On the other hand, they make my (and presumably others) head feel warm after 30+ minutes of listening. I would not want to wear these in a hot room in the summertime.In terms of build quality, they are very sturdy. I've run over the (very long) cord many times with my desk chair without any issue. I also toss the set around quite a bit and haven't noticed any damage. The Grados, on the other hand, would have probably exploded if exposed to the same abuse."
2036,0,if you are short and don't mind a flimsy strap....go for itother wise  stay away  from it.  wont trust my camera with it.
2037,0,"maxell has been one of my trusted use for blank discs for longer than i can remember.up until sometime in 2005...when maxell changed their discs.heres the differencethe 2004 model has the maxell guy on rhe left, and the cdr/80/700 tihng on the right. on the top it says maxell in big letters. also if you feel the background, it is a whole lot more stable. it doesnt chip easily. also the plastic used was not scratched easily.the 2005/2006 model is a whole lot worse. it says cd-r onl eft, highlighted. on top of that it has maxell in small letters. on the right it says 80/700 and the maxell guy is right below it. the top of the disc is obviously used with cheaper material, and it scratches easily.another thing noticeable from the two is burn errors. ive had no burn errors at all with either of the 2004 models (regular or music). on the 2005 model at least 80% failed.also when using nero express i tested imation and sony cd-rs just to make sure my recorder was ok. imation had a 10% fail rate and sony had a 0% fail rate...my recorder works fine.also, i tried burning at slower speed with no better results.why would imation and sony work on my computer and maxell wouldnt. because maxell cd-rs are garbage. avoid at all costs get imation sony or get maxell but only if the discs look like i explained on the 2004 modle becuase those were literally the best cdrs ive ever owned."
2038,2,The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place.  I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there.  And sound quality is perfect.
2039,0,"Thankfully - I was able to return it to the store after 5 days. So what was wrong with it -Firstly - for hardware revision B4, the software just would not install (some error about security code not being valid). Wasted many hours over this. A call to D-link tech support resulted in an email from them that only repeated steps I had already tried. Not very helpful and more waste of time.I wrote back in a stern manner - and tech support finally got back with a solution that involved installing the older driver along with a security code that they generated.OK - I was willing to live with this much. When I tried to use the device with the Jabra 250 BT headphone, I managed to get a range of around 18 feet and there was absolutely no signal one room away. Even within a room - signal was weak by the time I went to the end of the room. What was this claim about 30 feet range? This was awful performance and I decided I had enough and returned the product.Fast forward to my Linksys USBBT100 - . Firstly - it installed in a snap. The Jabra 250 now works through the furthest corner of the other rooms - no breakup - nothing. Boy - what a glaring difference.I for one will stay away from D-link for a long time to come!"
2040,0,"When my new Fujitsu laptop came with a free MuVo (64MB version), I was pretty happy that I got a super-compact MP3 player, even though I save most of my MP3/WMA files on my iPaq 1910 Pocket PC.  But after one week of use, I was sorely disappointed with this poor-quality Korean-made product with the Creative Labs name.I've been a fan of Creative Labs ever since I replaced my dead AdLib sound card with a Creative over 10 years ago.  Over the years I've been happy with their sound cards, so the poor quality of the MuVo came as a very sore disappointment for a loyal customer like myself.  Let me tell you what happened.I loaded the MuVo with about 10 songs.  I went on a short trip, and when I got off the plane, I found the files on the MuVo corrupted!  It couldn't have been an airport X-ray scanner problem, since both my iPaq 1910 and my Panasonic e-wear camcorder are totally fine, no errors with their flash memory.  I reformatted the MuVo and loaded a few new songs, but as I type this right now, one of them is corrupted and not playable.Since I got this free, I probably shouldn't whine, but judging from recent reviews of Creative Labs products posted here on Amazon, I don't think they are the same innovative, customer-friendly small company from Singapore any more."
2041,1,"I bought these for the company I work for to be used on sales rep and training personels laptops for presentations. It is good enough for that. For myself I bought the Bose companion 5. They are killer. No graphic equalizer, No sound controls etc. These were designed for great sound and the engineers did not want people messing them up trying to adjust sound controls. No need to any way. Just wish they were a bit louder but then the wife would get mad at me ha ha"
2042,1,"Unfortunately the unit that I received kept dropping its IP address frequently, about once every ten minutes.  I verified that the problems originated with the cable modem rather than my computer or router.  It also turned out to be hardware version 3, but was listed on a page for hardware version 4 devices (different DOCSIS specs).  I returned the defective modem for a refund.  It was labeled as &#34;very good&#34; condition, but had been obviously tampered with before.  Theoretically, based on the specs, this is a very stable, solid cable modem for DOCSIC 1.1 and 2.  Having owned various Linksys network gear I would think that a functional unit would be a stable, reliable cable modem.  Make sure to get the hardware version listed as approved modems with your cable provider. Mine, for example, requires a rev4 device."
2043,0,"I'm sure this cable is very high quality, but c'mon design guys, get a brain. I had to take a knife to it in order to get it to fit into the dvi port on my samsung 22"" monitor. The plastic surrounding the metal dvi connector is too wide to fit past the available space on my monitor. Then, my fingers barely had room to turn the tightening screws...it sure would have helped it they hadn't gone for the fancy gold colored screws and had just used a simple plastic tightener that had slots in the ends for a screwdriver like most cable tighteners. Also, as usual with Monster products, hugely overpriced."
2044,0,The unit did not work when I received it...Totally forgot that I could return it as some issues in other areascame up and I had forgotten about this headset.
2045,0,"Device driver would not install.  Simply hangs.  Second, this is an OEM of a Toshiba bluetooth adapter.  I cannot stand OEM'd products such as this because the support is terrible.

2046,2,"These are one of the best headphones that can be bought for the money!PROS- Great sound, I listen to Rock and Pop mp3 music mainly, and that sounds great! All friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the iPods are just amazed when they listen through this!- Comfort! You just don't feel them on your head after some time.- Lifetime Warranty! I bought them at Amazon in 2004. Was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly, and all the foams were gone. I got them repaired absolutely free (just paying the shipping costs), and that too in India! They are like new now.- Price! Bought them for $35 at amazon.- Portability is decent. They fold and don't take much space.CONS- Sound leaks. I use them at office, and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume- Looks, as others have said, they definitely look awkward.Overall, unless you want earbuds/noise cancelling phones/audiophile quality, you cannot go wrong with these."
2047,2,"First, there  is nothing wrong with this amp.  However, with today's speaker design, it is a bit much for the discreet seven channel home theater system unless you are trying to outfit it for a gymnasium sized room. I bought three of these because the price was right, and they work fine,  but at the settings I'm using, at one quarter power, it's like putting a Hemi 427 V8 in a Volkswagen Beetle.  The 100 watt version @ 50 watts per channel would have done fine. I also purchased the 100 watt version for the center channel speaker and it is more than adequate."
2048,1,"two lines LCD Navigation!120sec anti shock...Don't compare to expensive one. remember you're paying what you get....I bought one has openning problem, when I lift the player it will stop and LCD display the cover is open but the cover doesn't open. I figured it out becuase the screws is not tight enough, screw them tight! (Maybe the detection stick is no long enough, I posted little AA super glue at the end of the stick makes the stick can press the open/close botton firmly) If you apply that please wait the super glue solid before closing the cover otherwise you will get problem. Then I fixed it with no problem now. Cannot doubt it is cheap made because [of the] price. You cannot get a navigation LCD display and program select MP3/CD player that cheap in the market. So, that is great.For this price, please don't require very professional stuff on it. Its included earbuds must be replace ([Cheaply] made), Use Sony bass earbuds will make the player more valuable.For Rio SP series, I guess the laser head is cheap made. That is right many people complain it is only last a year or two then doesn't read disc. Sometimes, depends how you use it. Don't use it to read mal-made cd or pirated cd. and give a break to it. That will last longer.I am very satisfied by its price, batteries life and navigation.It is better look than SP90, SP90 = ugly!Cons: not easy to control. Philips EXP 200/300/400/500 series did a good job in saving batteries and controlling).  Sound quality is not well, compares to Philips/Sony/TDK."
2049,0,"I hate to write this.  The Tivo service is great.  Living without it is hard to imagine.  But I have now had 2 Tivo Series 2s break in the last 14 months.  This is an unacceptably high failure rate.  And Tivo's return/exchange policies are weighted heavily against the consumer.  The first time it cost $99 to replace with a refurbished unit.  This time Tivo wants $149 to replace (again with a refurbished unit that only carries a 30 day warranty).  Both times the problem appears to be the hard drive - once the entire unit just went haywire.  This time the unit downloads program data but fails to load it properly into the unit's database.  After 4 hours worth of calls to Tivo tech support both times, the engineering department decided the unit had to be replaced.  Just a heads up to prospective buyers.  I am going to purchase a 3rd party replacement drive (at least it carries a 6 month warranty) and keep my fingers crossed.  Good luck if you purchase one - I hope you have better luck!"
2050,1,"I bought a set of these speakers in 2006/2007. The sound quality was awesome; bass is crazy strong; simple black design is great; satellite controls and connectors are great.Late one night last month, they started to emit a very high volume buzzing tone out of nowhere. I got up, disconnected power, and went back to bed. Tested later, and one of the satellites has gone bad. Amp seems OK. Either channel will drive the good satellite.I bought a new set yesterday at BB. Noticed that the floor model has hardwired satellites...no more miniplugs. Darn. Then I noticed that the box seemed unusually light. So I weighed it. The new set weighs about 19 pounds. Old set is about 25 pounds.That's a very big difference in weight. Makes me think that the current models use much lighter/cheaper drivers and amp.So I'm going to make an extra effort to repair or replace the old satellite before I open the box on this newer, lighter version of the PM 2.1.Just FYI to anyone else who has an old set and is considering replacing them."

2052,0,"I tried three different headphones:Sennheiser 280 ProSound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way to tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.Audio Technica ath-m30The sound on these was just okay, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.Shure SRH440I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."
2053,0,"I bought this product about 4 years ago to use with my Windows Vista laptop.  It worked off-and-on with driver issues and connectivity issues.  I chalked it up to Vista not playing well with it and put it on my shelf.  Flash forward to last week.  I have a shiny new Windows 8 laptop and thought, hey, let's give it another go.  It connects just great and works beautifully for about 4 days.  Now, same issues.  It won't connect.  It won't stay connected.  The Logitech SetPoint driver doesn't recognize it.  It had brand new batteries last week, but I put in two more freshly opened batteries today.  I'm using it, and I watch the mouse pointer start to stut-stut-stutter across the screen and then freeze.  Now it won't connect again.Horrid garbage, which is now where it rests -- in the bottom of the garbage under coffee grounds and cat litter."
2054,2,"These headphones are some of the best I've ever had!  Sound quality and comfort are excellent.  Where have they been all my life?  If you are considering purchasing these headphones don't hesitate, just do it.  They are well worth the money!"
2055,0,"save your money for the 1.4..plastic build and really hit or miss on quality.my friend loves this thing, but i hated it.  after selling it to him, i picked up the 1.4 version (i know 3x the price..) and it made a huge difference.i'm in the ""you get what you pay for"" camp on this one..if feels really flimsy, the front of it can pop out easily,and while pics weren't horrible, they simply were not the quality of the 1.4"
2056,0,"The lens is okay on a 1.6 crop factor digital camera, but it isn't particularly wide-angle then (32mm field of view).  I hear that it is okay on a film camera, but I have no experience.  On a full-frame digital camera, it stinks....Digital cameras can be affected by the angle a lens causes light to hit the sensor, and it seems to make a difference here.  The lens produces smudged, blurry images on my full-frame camera.  It is okay on my Rebel XTi, but not wide enough to be impressive.  It stinks on my 1Ds.Build quality is okay, but nothing special.  If you buy this despite my recommendation, spend a bit of money to get the lens hood (which doesn't come with the lens).  It will help keep glare off the front element.If you can afford it, buy one of the wide-angle L zooms instead of this lens.  If you can't afford those, get a Sigma zoom (preferably the 12-24, but alternately the 15-30) instead of this lens."
2057,1,"You get what you pay for. This won't compare very well to budget name brand subs. But it will fill in some bass. Not so stable when pushed. But at low volume levels it can produce decent lows. Not very hard hitting, but does the job if you want a cheap, small sub, to warm up your sound. Would be good to add balanced bass to a factory car stereo. If you have an aftermarket system, the bass will not be enough. I was pushing this sub with an amp matched to true rms ratings of this sub at 4ohms."
2058,1,Okay - even the original battery doesn't last very long.  While they charge fairly quick I'd rather they took longer to charge and worked longer.  Even with a spare you're not going to last all day taking lots of shots with even two batteries.While it is not the batteries fault it is still a problem I think they won't solve soon.  Had I known beforehand that the Canons ate so much battery life so quickly I would have purchased a different camera.  I can't fill my 128 MB stick with the use of a single battery.So if you like to travel and go on hikes etc. where weight is important I would highly recommend finding a camera that doesn't eat batteries like they were candy.  The camera is light enough but the batteries are inefficient and you need to take a fully charged army of them with you on a back country trip adding a lot of un-needed weight.
2059,0,"I tried these. I can only list one pro and one con.Pro: very comfortableCon: no bassIf you're like me and like a lot of bass, pass on these."
2060,1,"I bought these after reading a review of &#34;best headphones under $100. They are ok but nothing special. Bass is strong but not tight, mids and highs could be better. In that rough price range, i've since bought two headphones that are WAY BETTER: Bose AE2: tight, strong bass balanced by great soundstage, mids and highs, and Grado SR80i, which have UNPARALLELED mids, highs, and an airy, spacious soundstage, and tight, precise, but less pronounced, bass. The Bose are sealed around-the-ear phones, and the Grados are open-back. You would do well to consider the Bose and Grado's: superior sound at a reasonable price."
2061,1,"This turntable is ok for the casual LP listener.  I had to hook it up to an old amp I had to get any sound out of it and even with that, there is an annoying hum.  I have about 500 LPs and I needed a new turntable.  My old one was just like this and after about 14 years it started to play records too fast or too slow.I would recommend checking out ThinkGeek's selection, as they have portable players plus vinyl to mp3 converters that are a better deal than this one."
2062,1,I have big head. Those are too tight. Bass is not impressive.
2063,2,"I had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and I must say they're still working great. Excellent, audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price. So far, they've held up incredibly well over the year or so I've had them. They're very light and they haven't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all, but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to. The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that, but they will fit with a bit of finagling. I am a 19 year old college student, so I'm on the go a lot. I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in. If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck, they're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size, so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace. I also love getting looks from people. Some comments include:""I like your headphones.""""Those are some wacky ass headphones man.""""Those are nice how much did they cost.""""They sound amazing.""et cetera.Pros:-I personally love the 80's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable. (Duh)-Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting, they're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam, but a bit less squishy.-They (used to) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them. I'll explain below.-Of course, the best thing, they sound great.Cons:-They fold small, but not flat. The headphones are still as thick, when folded, as the diameter of the ear pieces and such. I really wish they folded flat, that would make these truly great.-They don't FEEL all that well made. (But have held up thus far)-Over the course of the year or so I've had them, the metal headband part has bent slightly, but I imagine it's from the times I've tried to fold them up too small, so be aware of that, I'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while (an hour or so).Meh:-I don't like how small the carrying case is, if it wasn't so well made, I'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away. Actually, it's not the case itself that's too small, as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well, but the opening. It doesn't open very wide. Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap, but not exceptional, but I can't complain.-They don't noise cancel, but they're not noise cancelling headphones. I put this here because it's both good and bad. I like hearing my music in peace, but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear. So they're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides, it's a switch you have to work. No, it is not an electronic switch for ""bass boost"" or anything like that, so don't get all excited. It's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter. If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though, it'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think. It's kinda gimmicky, but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY. This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So, as you can see, my cons and such are mostly about certain ""bonus"" features of the headphones. As a pair of headphones, they're the best I've ever had.Okay, so as I wrote above, there are two things I have to elaborate on:-Self adjustment: When I first bought these headphones, I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head, and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology. Neat. Well, it's been a while and, while I do my best to take care of my technology, all the folding/unfolding of them, due to the nature of the design, has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in. It does NOT look any different aesthetically, but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally. And by ""little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes,"" I mean ""those black things on the metal headband that guide it through."" Anyhow, not a huge deal, as it's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones: As I've said above, the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will (if you're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing) bend the metal headband to the point where it won't self-adjust as easily as it originally did. So, I'm going to help you figure out how to fold them, so you can avoid bending your pair on accident. Okay, so, it's pretty easy to do. The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward. Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears. They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions. Now, on each side of the hinge area, there is a loop and a hook. I don't remember which side is which, but you'll see it. It's the end of the metal headband. Hook the ends into the ends, and you'll have a nice neat circle. Now, you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself, but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT. This is how you will bend them. I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in. Now you should be good to go and they'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow, that's about all I have to say. These are well worth the money. I don't use them at home, because I have larger, more comfy headphones for that, but if I'm out? This is all I use. I generally hate earbuds, I always have, so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere."
2064,2,"I bought a total of 3 Cordemate kits, and learned a few lessons during installation. Like the old saying, &#34;measure twice, cut once,&#34; a little care needs to be applied when installing... mainly because the adhesive REALLY sticks! Once you peel off the backing and place it on a surface, correctly or not, you're NOT going to move it without some serious effort and regret. So, plan and measure ahead wisely. Some other reviewers have listed a few tips, my own are: 1) after cutting to size, open the channel and place the wires inside BEFORE sticking to wall; 2) be sure to allow space for the thickness of fittings; 3) dry-fit EVERYTHING, before final stick-down. Once installed, it's a great improvement over dangling and unsightly wires."
2065,0,"GOOD REVIEWS HERE WERE FOR THE PREVIOUS DESIGN. NEW MODEL NO GOOD--AGAIN AND AGAIN.The old version was great (different design, same model number).This new version (rectangular) dead on arrival (DOA)--AGAIN.I tried it when the new version first came out and it was dead.Desperately tried the new version again, and AGAIN DOA.What is wrong with TERK? Are they unaware of this?Is Amazon unaware?Why do they keep manufacturing and selling defective units??"
2066,0,"The sound quality is good for headphones of this size and price. The problem I have with them is that the ear-cups don't rest flat over the ears. The angle of the ear-cups isn't right, so after awhile that part of each ear that receives more of the contact of the ear-cups begins to hurt. I've never had this problem with headphones before, so I don't think my head or ears, etc, is anything out of the ordinary. I've had cans that were too tight on my ears, but I don't remember the ear-cup angle being the problem. I previously used similar cans--one from this same manufacturer and another from a different maker (both of which I wanted to replace with these new units since they the old ones had a lot of miles on them and the sound quality was gone), but the ear-cups on both of those units rest perfectly flat on my ears. I put them on again to confirm it. I prematurely ordered two sets of these cans and the ear-cups are the same on both--resting at an angle as opposed to flat on my ears.I prefer this style of light-weight headphones, but these are uncomfortable because the ear-cups don't rest flat on my ears, so I have to order something else. The sound quality is good and the volume is better (louder) than my older units, but since they become a bit uncomfortable after about an hour or so, well, they're no good for me"
2067,1,"a little after the 2 year warranty went out, my headphone started to develop small cracks near the head pad. i wish they addressed this flaw in the material of choice. plastic does not flex as good as metal. its too bad theres no competition in this price range. wouldnt mind paying extra for a metal support on the collapsible headset."
2068,0,"The D-Link make for a great night light. We're making every effort to cut down on ""vampire"" electronics. I found a better product with less light pollution."
2069,1,"I am kicking myself for not starting with these speakers in the first place.  After buying an Altec-Lansing 2.1 system with no mid-range and a constant sub woofer hum, I decided to increase my budget.  While I can't say that I like the look of the satellites as much as I liked the compact Altect-Lansings, there is no arguing with how they sound...which can be summed up in one word - wow.These speakers have no bass and treble controls...and they do not need them.  The mix is perfect regardless of source. They do, however, have a subwoofer bass level control mounted on one of the satellites, which allows you to tone things down for late night DVD viewing...while keeping the base on the satellites intact.So, what's not to like? Well, not much frankly...but here there are a few features that I would like to see refined.- The wiring is hokey.  I really wish that the input source went into the sub and that each satellite had only a single wire connecting it to the sub (a common design for other 2.1 systems).  Instead, the control satellite has three wires exiting the back of the satellite - a flimsy speaker wire, a hard-wired input source line, and a hard-wired control line to the sub.  Also, as mentioned, the stereo wire that connects both sats to the sub is both flimsy and, further exacerbating matters, custom...featuring a 3.5mm stereo plug on one end and bare wire (meant for sub-mounted dual clips) on the other.  Many users eventually report static with this setup after time and end up replacing the wiring.- The power switch is on the back of the sub...not on the control satellite.- The grills, while not completely unattractive, could be refined.  That said, take them off and these speakers look pretty cool.Admittedly, some of those complaints may be picky, but this is a mid price range multimedia 2.1 speaker system so I expected better...especially with regards to the  wiring.  That said, the sound is stellar...so four stars.  When Klipsch works out a couple of those other issues...or cuts the price in half...then I will award that elusive fifth star.  :-)===========================February 2012 UPDATE...and a WARNING:Eight years have passed since I wrote my original review and Amazon is still listing this product.  In fact, the product is still selling well. Unfortunately, it is NOT the same product...even though it shows up under the same Amazon listing.The old Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 was a very high quality set.  Thus, it was very popular.  So what did Klipsch do?  Guess.The sub now weighs 5 pounds less...FIVE.  Does it matter?  Seems so, since folks who have owned both this version and the old version state that the bass is no longer beautifully integrated into the sound profile with the sats.  Now it is fairly ""boomy.""Well, how about that hokey wiring that I noted 8 years ago.  Did they improve it?  No,  in fact, it's worse.  The speaker wire that comes out of the back of EACH sub (and that must EACH travel to the sub) is now hardwired.  Klipsch claims that this change is an improvement.  Many of us disagree.What else?  Well, for years people complained that the sats didn't have a power switch and that you had to use the switch on the sub to power the system off.  So what did Klipsch do?  They removed the power switch from the sub.  You now need to unplug the sub to turn the system off.  Yes, unplug.What's worse is that the price now ranges from the old price (~$150) to well over $200.---So should you buy this system?  Well, that's a tough call.  Frankly, while the system seems to have gone down a few notches, it is still probably a far better option than most 2.0 systems.  You just can't get decent bass with small drivers...regardless of what folks try to sell you.Unfortunately, gone are the days when you could go to a local B&M; and audition a full aisle of computer speakers.  Perhaps that's due to falling profit margins at B&Ms;, the need to diversify at such outlets, or the fact that many people now use laptops instead of desktops.  Regardless, the situation remains - you must now rely on online reviews and roll the dice.  Reviews like this one.  ;)In my opinion, this system is probably not a bad option if you can find it for ~$150, but I wouldn't pay any more.  If you had the old version, you'll probably be disappointed even if you can find it for that price.  Personnaly, if I was looking today, I would probably spend 100 beans more and get a 2.1 Swan M50W system...and tell Klipsch to stick their ""improvements"" ;)"
2070,1,"I am surprised when people say that they have noticed significant improvement in picture quality and sound with this. My home Audio Video setup includes a $4000 audiophile grade stereo system and a $2500 42 inch  sony LCD projection TV.  With all that money and low distortion equipment you can detect the smallest of the change quite easily. I am so sensitive to sound quality that twice my speakers were replaced due to sound distortion that I noticed (distortion that the dealer failed to notice but the manufacturer did).  I am a music guy, clean music is what I care about. Believe me HTS - whatever,  does not lead to a significant sound improvement. On the other hand it might bring your amp juice down. You know you have to crank up the volume knob a little more than what you would do without it.  I played different CDs with and without the so called clean power and I could not observe any significant change. Your experience may differ from mine. My audio components come from NAD who are known for their excellent noise free transformers in their amps players, tuner etc.Coming to video  the HDTV snowflakes are still visible. Specially in the scenes of running water.  From my experience all I can tell you is, the flakes are dependent on the transmission quality. In channels like INHD, CINIMAX, HBO you wouldn't get any flakes in the picture while channels like thirteen HD are full of it (specially scenes with running water). So did the clean power make any difference ? Yes it did, given you don't change any color settings of your TV the ""clean power"" would dull the extra bright bleeding colors..Colors intensity looks more natural..Hey but that's some thing you can do with your color settings  right !....So why monster clean power-----answer is surge protection. That's all. Home insurance doesn't offer surge protection monster does. Not only that. Good music / TV systems are brought with a lot of passion.  I have spent close to 6 months deciding  my stereo system...another 2 months perfecting it. It would be sad if I loose it  to a surge and that's the reason why I chose to keep this HTS what-ever clean power. :o)....and hey don't fall for the gimmick they show you on the monster cable website...My whole system sits next to an Air conditioner....In fact theoretically speaking my entire system shares the same power line as my air conditioner does....I did not notice any change even close to what monster cable guys claim :o) .... Your money your choice ....!"
2071,0,This adapter is slower than my Canon Rebel XT. I measured about 1 MB/sec with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB card - close to the speed of USB 1.1. Do not waste your money.
2072,0,"I purchased 3 pairs for an office to be shared by 3 people (myself and 2 others). The only criteria was cheap, headphone jack and decent looking, and these fit the bill, except...Like others here, the USB power method seemed like a good idea to save plug usage. It may be a good ""idea"", but as some others have noted, the implementation of the idea is fatally flawed.There's a HUGE amount of noise using headphones and a 5.8GHz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers off.Very disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite 2 with no packaging."
2073,2,"I searched a long time for a set of portable headphones.  I had a set of in ear bugs and although they were great my ears would hurt after wearing them.  The Koss phones are very portable and have amazing sound for the price.  Many people said that the bass was to much but I found that for the music I listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music.  One problem is that when they retract or pull apart, your hair can get caught in them.  These are also not noise cancelling phones so that you will hear a lot of external sound.  For me I wear them sometimes when driving so that works perfect for me.  I would recommend them as being really a good buy for the price if you are looking for a portable non noise cancelling headphone."
2074,2,"A lot of people here seems to think this thing is the greatest thing since slice bread and to a certain extent it is good...indoors.  Indoors in a small to medium size room with walls where the infra-red signal can bounce around it works great!  Outdoors unless the transmitter has a good line of sight to the flashes...not so great.  I would easily recommended this for indoor work. Personally, I am looking into some kind of radio trigger for the flashes."
2075,2,"I have a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones which I bought a couple years ago use for listening to music, videos etc on my pc or sansa. However they were never really very suitable for jogging or biking in (not a tight enough fit and will come loose during excessive movement).The bud type earphones just don't cut it for me - uncomfortable and sound quality just crappy. I wonder why most other people are happy to wear bud type phones? Maybe my ears are deformed...Anyways, I googled the web and found several good review's of these koss phones for running.I bought a pair a couple of months ago and I must say that it's one of the best buys I have ever made.The sound quality of the Koss Portapro is excellent and slightly better than my Sennheiser PX 100's. They fit very snugly and feel very light when running and that plus the excellent sound quality make them a great buy.One feels very happy when you have paid a small amount of money for great quality and great sound.Now when I'm sitting at my pc and need phones for listening it becomes a bit more of a toss up. The Koss sound quality is great and with a snug fit. The Sennheiser PX 100 although not quite as good sound quality have a very light feel to them.For walking, running and  general moving around - these Koss phones are the way to go.May 2012 Update:These guys are holding up well despite some pretty rugged treatment - highly recommended"
2076,2,"Koss ""The Plug"", for only $13, is a terrific way to try the ear-canal type of headphone.  They are very comfortable to wear for long periods, have terrific bass, good sound and are comfortable to wear when in bed.  One's opinion of headphone sound is very subjective and comparison is limited because you cannot instantly change from one phone to another. One reason that there are endless opinions of headphone sound.The Plug has foam inserts that expand too fast making it almost impossible to get it into the ear before it expands.  If you do not get a good air seal, there will be little or no bass.The fix is to buy a set of  foam ear plugs (Walmart $1.47 for 12).  Squeeze it flat, use a scissor for cut proper length, re-squeeze under water, let it expand full size, freeze it and then drill the hole to replace the existing foam insert.  You will end up with an ear plug that really works and is very comfortable to wear. You probably will be so happy with ""The Plug"" that you won't have to upgrade to the $300 models!"
2077,0,"I purchased this printer in Dec. 2010. It was my first Kodak printer purchase and I was very pleased with it. It did everything I needed it to do (print, scan, copy, and fax). Good print quality and very fast drying ink. Also nice low priced ink refills. I didn't use the printer a lot, on average maybe a couple pages printed per day.One day last week I went to print something and I got an error message on the screen indicating the print carriage was jammed. I went through the steps provided on the screen and still jammed. I turned the printer off and back on, still jammed. Did some extensive research on the internet and found this to be a very common problem with this printer. I then contacted Kodak's customer service, and while they are very friendly they told me ""sorry, the printer is dead and your warranty is expired"". I was very dissapointed to hear this. They then went on to suggest that I should go ahead and buy a new Kodak printer because ""no one else has such low prices on ink refills""!  I couldn't believe they were telling me this. So it doesn't matter that the printer dies after two years of minimal use because the ink cartridges are so affordable?That was my first and last Kodak printer."
2078,0,I've upgraded the firmware backwards and forwards but this puppy drops connections like my old switch never does. Everything seems to work fine but then a larger download and it consistently doesn't complete. I've changed the MTU size and that seems to have an effect but it's still erratic and won't complete downloads. I switch back the to switch and 'no problem'. I'm using it in wired mode so its not a WiFi issue.
2079,0,"For the price I suppose I can't be too disappointed, but the USB cord seems to intermittently lose it's connection to my PC. Every so often I have to unplug the adapter then put it back in. Lately I seem to need to do this more often. Besides this I haven't had any issues with the adapter, but I've only had the adapter for a month or two and at this rate soon it will no longer be worth using with the frustration it causes.Edit, about two months after writing this review, I threw out the cord because it had to be replugged in too frequently to use. All in all, the cords lasted about a third of a year and the issue started immediately after buying them and only got worse."
2080,0,I have tried this with my polycom phone and polycom headset nothing but static.  save yourself the grief and buy the amplifier
2081,1,"It worked really well and I was totally satisfied with this mouse until several months ago.  (which means, after two years of usage)The problem slowly came up to the surface.Single click was started to be recognized as a double click.I'm kind of getting sense on how much pressure on the left mouse button determines single click or double click.If I press the button very lightly, it register as single click.If I press little bit harder, it takes it as double click.In scroll button case, they are reverted.Press scroll button hard makes single click and lighter makes double click.Now, I'm sick of it (since numerous times a day, I launch wrong application because of that double click problem), and considering buying logitech MX300"
2082,1,"For the low price of under $100, these are superb for a single purpose.  For us, that purpose is soft, quiet background music in a formal dining room that is not used very often.  If you intend to play louder or try to fill a room or section of your house, these speakers will not do well.  They get muddy at higher volumes and do not have good bass.But, for a small space where you only need background music, these can't be beat for the price.  Once your hole is cut, these install easily.  Cutting the hole is a project in and of itself.  Be careful!"
2083,2,"My dad has had them for 10 years, they still work as if they were new. My bro has them, I've had them for a year... And have gotten 4 people to get them too.Nothing beats them, period. They deliver an incredible sound performance, feel great, don't leak too much, isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise, are unbreakable and extremely portable.Get them with no hesitation."
2084,2,"I remember seeing these in K-Mart way back in college. Hard to imagine that they're still making them, or that they're really still that good! Perhaps the latter is the reason for the former. You can spend a couple hours online reading one review after another after  google-ing &#34;best bang for the buck headphones under $100.&#34; Yeh, I did that. Or you can just take 8 seconds and click &#34;add to cart&#34; and get them delivered to your door in a day or so. Really, you're not going to be sorry. Really. No, really."
2085,2,"Yes, it is a serious camera bag and yes, it is small.  But what I did not know until mine arrived was that it has a ""built-in waist belt"" inside a ""rear pouch"" that adds weight and bulk.  It is not removeable altho the shoulder strap is.  Minus one star.Otherwise it is perfect for my Canon G6 with my Canon 220 EX speedlite mounted and ready to use.  I'm going to keep it."
2086,2,"I bought a pair of these.... over 20 years ago! They still work, and more important, sound fantastic! I've replaced the ear pads due to age, but that's it.What stands out about these today, just as it did back in the early 1980s is the true high fidelity sound quality - including true extended bass. From low bass through the highest treble, these are well balanced and natural sounding. More money will buy a headphone that excels in one area, but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there. To add more transparency to the musical reproduction is going to just plain cost you - and they will be a larger set.In closing, I misplaced my pair (since found) and spent $50 on a pair of well respected affordable AKGs. These sound better.Highly recommended!"
2087,2,The switch is easy to install on and remove from the camera. It functions well. It is well designed; the shape makes it easy to hold. The trigger button works smoothly. I especially like that it's designed for the cable to be wound around the body of the switch and cable stores into the notches to keep it wound. There's also a storage location for the plug. Good design.
2088,2,Works great and takes paint easily.  The only bad thing is if you have to remove it they will take part of the wall with them.
2089,0,This is the item made in China and only last for two weeks. I would  not buy again or recommend to a friend.
2090,2,"what else can you say. it's the same disposable super-wide-angle-lens, 800 ISO cameras you used for years before digital cameras, but waterproof."
2091,0,Connected the Headset to Avaya Phone on Headset Jack.Checked the Manual - http://ec1.images-amazon.com/media/i3d/01/A/man-migrate/MANUAL000045366.pdfMIC is not working ? I am able to hear... Headphones are working.Does one require additional Base System for this to work ?
2092,1,"As usual shipping was fast; the wire is 16g but feels like 18g. It was very pliable and shielding was strong, was able to wire my car with it and run the wires under the carpet and through some tight corner and it did not nick or broke the core. All in all good wire, does what its suppose to do."
2093,2,"I liked it so much I bought two!  Actually, I lost the first one and then found it the same day my new one came in.  Now I have a backup.My only complaint is that the holder is meant for use with a thin (stock) shoulder strap.  I put on a much more comfortable (and thicker) aftermarket strap and the holder won't fit.Until looking at the pictures in this review, I didn't realize that the holder can also be used to stabilize the lens (prevent camera from tipping forward) when the camera is set on a flat surface.  Nice touch!  (Unfortunately, I usually have the Vertical Grip installed which obviously makes the camera too tall for this feature.)I guess I have another complaint, but it's not exactly about this product, it's about Canon's placement of the product: Canon does NOT support this infrared remote on their higher end digital cameras.  They probably do this to avoid canibalizing sales of their much more EXPENSIVE (hundreds of dollars) but also MUCH longer range LC-5 (which doesn't work on the Rebel).  They do the same thing with their wired remotes, so if you upgrade, you can use your lenses and flashes, but you have to upgrade your wired and wireless remotes.  Not a good PR move."
2094,0,"Not only is it light and dinky-feeling, but on every restart the system complains that /System/Library/Extensions/MacallyMouse.kext was installed improperly and cannot be used (which is odd, as it works anyway).  Reinstalling from the CD appears to proceed normally, but the message recurs.  Their website tech support area is no help.I would not buy one of these again.  Good feature list for the price and it works fine, but it just doesn't feel like it belongs on a Mac.  It's also much brighter than it needs to be, and flashes red with any vibration (including music)... I get the impression this light leakage is intentional to look cool."
2095,1,"Well, my first Basslink lasted 3 years.  So why did I get another?  Simple, it's such a simple installation and provides just the right amount of performance in my truck (and extended cab with the unit under the seat).  I'll like get the original fixed and keep it as spare since these units are not noted for their reliability.Given the above, if you want good sound, and easy install, and are limited on space, this is a good unit, not great (reliability), but good."
2096,2,"I have owned the mini version of this case for my Olympus E-510 for about three years now and have not have any issues with it, so I though I'd buy this full sized version for my recently purchased Canon 7D, and I am happy to report that it fits the Canon nicely.  With the kit lens (28-135) the 7D has a little wiggle room on both sides and about half an inch form the back of the camera to the top of the bag.  By folding the 7D's strap up behind the camera it fills that extra space nicely.This is not the case to get if you like to travel with a lot of accessories and lenses though since there is not much room left when you put a camera like the 7D in it.  It has a small pouch on the underside of the cover, perfect for a compact flash card or two, and another larger pouch on the front of the case.  The larger pouch can hold the charger, a cable or two, and a few more compact flash cards.  The case also includes two little Velcro dividers to section it off if your camera is significantly smaller than the case.The case is nicely constructed and can stand up to an occasional sprinkle of water.  The padding is not very thick, but works well for minor impacts.The one thing I don't like about the case is the new shoulder strap.  On the older mini version the ends of the shoulder strap were sown down.  On the new one you get extra material hanging off the strap if you shorten it.  Not only does this extra material get in the way, but also the strap is a bit less secure.All in all... the prefect case for a larger semi-pro SLR (Canon 7D and 50D and Nikon D300s), but a bit too big for consumer level SLRs (Canon Rebel and Nikon D3000)."
2097,2,I connected the speakers in my hot tub to my computer so I needed a volume control at the hot tub - works perfectly!
2098,0,"You'd think this would be pretty good (because it bares the ""Olympus"" name), however, it didn't work, right out of the box!  Don't waste your money."
2099,0,"Even tho this is pretty cheap, it totally doesn't cool down my notebook PC, so it's just a piece of totally useless metal plate.  In theory it should lift up your notebook to allow better air flow at the bottom, but in reality no, it doesn't have any cooling affect at all.  It's cheap, but still a waste of money for a student like myself."
2100,1,"I bought this for some short runs, so I'm not too unhappy with it. When I went to terminate the wire, I was surprised to see that the exterior of the wire is copper, but that's just a coating; the wire is aluminum.  It will work, but aluminum is much less conductive than copper.  I'm wasting a few watts when I use this cable.Other than that, the cable is easy to work with.  It's flexible, not brittle, and the jacket is nice.  I didn't measure the spool, but there's probably 100 feet there.  Finally, the 14 gauge measurement is accurate, since that's the setting I use to strip it with my Klein strippers.In all, the product is usable and meets its specs, but I'm disappointed that the wire is not copper. I'll use what I've got, but won't be buying this product again."
2101,2,Ok - my first CB... I love this thing... so far so good. Good quality and looks durable. I did go buy an external antenna to boost reception ($15). I'll be testing this more this weekend when I go off-roading with a buddy and his CB. I recommend this.
2102,2,"No leak issues and all 4 cameras worked well. The developed film largely came out well but a couple were unintelligible. The cameras were purchased for our trip to the Bahamas. The strap is like a rubber band and winding and snapping pictures is a breeze. Next underwater trip I take, I will be purchasing more of these."
2103,2,"This finder, a standard on the ETX125, is a must for the ETX90 if one plans on using it for astronomy. The straight thru finder is fine for birding, or other terrestrial viewing, but is akwardly placed for most astronomical observing, especially near the zenith (overhead). The tiny screw used to hold the finder can be difficult to replace. Then again, it is still only a 25mm finder."
2104,0,"I bought my triports when they first came out. I listen to them every day at work and within the first week, I broke both sides.  I called bose and they said they hadn't had any problems but told me to return.  I did and the second pair did the same thing.  A little scotch tape and they worked fine for over a year.  Now I just snapped off the left ear piece.  Maybe I have a big head but I definitely don't abuse these headphones to a point where they should break so easily.  Great sound, bad engineering.  Next headphones will definitely not be the triports."
2105,0,I got this to go with my Bose Wave radio to get better reception on a station only 60 miles away. It didn't do a very good job. In fact the Bose worked just as well without it.
2106,1,This is not easy to program but when I did get it programed it worked ok on most devices except those that use a single button for on and off and then it hung up a couple times and would do nothing until I removed the batteries for a few seconds and then reinstalled.  Returned for refund but would have gotten a replacement except for the one button on and off problem. When I would set one button macro to turn everything off my samsung dvd would turn on (when it was off) as it was one of the devices that use the same button on its remote to turn on and off. The learn feature worked great.  I did talk to the tech line a couple time for set up information and they very helpful and knowledgeable about their remote.
2107,2,"These are good ties in a useful variety of sizes.  The quality is good and the zips actually lock in place.  Sometimes with cheap ties they don't securely hold their position.  No trouble with this product, buy with confidence."
2108,1,"First and foremost, please note that these speakers have changed since they were first introduced. This review is more of a comparison between the old set which I originally purchased in 2004 and that now has a flaky DIN input plug (huge known issue with the older model) and this new set that was purchased in November 2011.Notable differences:1) The notorious DIN plug was changed so it doesn't stick straight out of the subwoofer, potentially resulting in less failures. This is probably the biggest plus of the new set.2) The wires on the satellite speakers are now hardwired instead of being connected via 3.5mm plugs. This is a drawback for those who wanted to use higher gauge wires for the speakers to (potentially) increase sound quality, HOWEVER, it also fixed the issue of the plugs producing static if moved, even if the movement was the result of sound playing from the speaker(s)! With the old set, I found myself sometimes moving the plugs around to prevent dropouts\static, and now this issue is resolved.3) In comparison with the old subwoofer, the new one definitely sounds boomy and less deep in sound. This could be due to not having a break-in period, but it was definitely an issue as I was no longer pleased with the bass being produced. I could no longer get the subwoofer to seamlessly blend between the satellites and the subwoofer as the boomy-ness always made it apparent that the bass was coming from under my desk. This was NOT an issue with the old model, ever.As a side note and possibly the cause of this, the subwoofer is now 5.5 pounds lighter than the older one.4) There is no longer a power switch on the subwoofer so you can't turn them off without unplugging them from the outlet. Not a huge deal as idle power draw is low, but this might be annoying for those with power consumption concerns.All in all, I decided not to keep the new set. It seems like they cut every corner in this newer model, and while that had a pro or two, the overall result is a lower quality product at the same price point. I'll be looking at the Logitech Z623's now as I have always been impressed with Logitech build quality AND warranty support, something I can't say about Klipsch, who want to nickel and dime you for replacements, even when it's a known issue."
2109,1,"Pros: The sound quality is pretty good but nothing that will blow you away. But do give it some time to break in. I'm glad that the cord is very long (3m/10feet) so that I can watch movie from my big screen desktop HD monitor while lying on my bed. Many of the headphones out there have short cables.Cons: Unfortunately, the headphone is too uncomfortable to wear for longer duration (I've an average ear size, I guess). The ear cups put force on my ears and I have to constantly readjust it when I wear for more than 15-30mins. The cups could have been a little more spacious and cushioned for more comfort. On the flip side, this looks compact compared to some other top headphones out there.Other thoughts: I tried very low frequency sound test (high bass) and the headphone started crackling. Crackling stayed for some time even for general audio but sound became normal after a while."
2110,0,"I was totally stoked to get the Canon 50mm EF II f1.8 and read the reviews about how cool it was, how the pictures were awesome, and how if you are careful the plastic casing wouldn't be an issue. Boy was I wrong. Let me start by telling you that I ADORE the photos I have with this lens. Completely love them, but the problem is I bought the lens in August and it has been broken more than it works. After one months the near focus didn't work. I could only shoot at infinity with it. I sent it back to Canon and it took two months to get it back! It worked fine again, but I noticed it's very loud when shooting AI SERVO (which I did on a dance concert photo shoot where I had 4,000 shots with it). It also made grinding noises. I shot with it for about another month and while away on holiday I went to take a shot and the focus didn't work again. I flipped to manual to get my shot before finding a table where I could examine the lens closer, but the focus ring would NOT turn. I took what amounted to a terribly blurry shot and went to a table. I took off the lens and tried to turn the ring again. This time, the front glass of the 1.4 fell of right in my hand! My lens is now in two pieces, and I am ready to call Canon to demand a replacement not a repair. I will then sell the replacement and use the money towards a 50mm f1.4!"
2111,0,"I bought this for my Panasonic cordless phones at home so I could use while working from home.  Being hands free was great and made me wish I had purchased these earlier. Unfortunately 6 months later while on a call all the sound cut out. I grabbed the phone and it came back.  That went on for the entire call and I finally identified the problem.  The wires the feed into the elbow (hard plastic piece which turns 90 degrees and becomes the plug) must have gotten loose or kinked somehow.  Wiggling the wires gets the headset to go in and out on demand and it is to the point where I need to hold it in a specific way to be able to hold a conversation. I will not buy again. Instead I am using an old Motorola cell phone headset which seems to be holding up much better.It seems to be hit or miss because not everyone is having the issue.  I am giving this product two stars instead of one because when it did work, it sounded great and was very comfortable."
2112,0,"After much research - I took the plunge - and plucked down [money] for this thing. What a mistake ! Musicmatch software syncing to IPOD was awful - with dropouts - and transfers in which you had no idea whether the songs were transferring or not. There is no visble indicator of song transfer ! Then I tried Ephpod after reading some reviews - it just caused XP to freeze. Believe me, I put computers together as a hobby - and this thing was a big mistake. Don't spend your money ! Poor software & too expensive - even with the 10GB ! I'm returning mine - last Apple I ever own !"
2113,2,"I haven't had a lot of oppurtunity to really play with it yet, but I do like it a lot better than the corded one that I have for my film Canon Rebel.  With the cord being about 3 feet long, it's not very ideal for some things.  But, with this wireless remote, that's no problem.  Also, you can set it with a delay so that you can take shots of yourself and not look like an idiot holding on the the remote :)"
2114,2,"This is a very large camera bag and it has many pockets to store different items.  It is very easy for a person to organize items with this bag.  I saw another Canon camera bag at Fry's Electronics with a black rain proof bag.  Why didn't Canon provide a bag with 1EG?  Other than that, there are two straps at the bottom of the bag.  I think the straps are for the tripod but I am not sure about that since even Canon's own website does not explain its design features.Nevertheless, this bag feels fairly sturdy so  Iam giving it four stars."
2115,0,i have tried using this hub multuiple times and every time it either locks up my computer or freezes it till i unplug it. programs stop working or work slowly. i used it to connect external hard drives and a wireless mouse. the mouse did not work at all.
2116,0,"... and unfortunately the firmware sucks!  Google ""BEFSX41 firmware upgrade problems"" and see what you get.  I had mine running a stable (but vulnerable) firmware and decided to download the latest firmware from Linksys' site to close the security hole.  Unfortunately it wasn't until numerous problems began (router reboots, disconnects, no internet connection) that I checked for firmware issues and found problems via Google.  There are NO WARNINGS on that Linksys download site.  They are essentially providing software to BREAK your product!  It got so bad, I couldn't connect to the internet anymore.  I had to go to work to download an older firmware (unfortunately Linksys DOES NOT provide these!) from dslreports.  They fixed most of my problems, but there is a list of bugs that still have not been fixed.  Fortunately, I don't use the features that trigger those bugs.  I'm providing the link so that someone who has purchased it can upgrade their firmware at THEIR DISCRETION!  Otherwise, I would say do not buy this product!  It's unnecessary headaches when other routers will work just as well.  (Though I hear D-Link products also have problems)[...]"

2120,0,"This unit charges batteries very fast (Hence the name Rapid Charger), It does make the batteries very hot during charging, I believe that it might damage the batteries in the long run, But so far it seems to work correctly, The provided 4 batteries are only 2000mAh (*New Updated*) which are worthless, My 4 year old Creative 1800mAh Batteries are better even after all these years of use.(You get the point?) The A/C adapter is good for only 120V AC, wish it had dual A/C selection switch for use in other countries, Car Charger adapter is added bonus, But that is rarely used. There are better products out there, But for the Price I think it does it's job okay."
2121,1,"I used these to mount my Accoustimass speakers in our new family room.  They look good enough and aren't distracting, but for the price they're just not all that impressive.  No Bose items are cheap, and some (like this one) push the envelope approaching over priced, but they work fine and as advertised.  I'm satisified with the product, but I do feel I paid a bit of an unnecessay premium for them."
2122,0,"I have two of these and replaced both because when I reboot my computer, my usb peripherals are ""not there"" until I power cycle the hub. (Which is across the room) Both do the same thing with a variety of different peripherals.  It took me awhile to figure out the problem was with the HUB.  Try the Cyberpower 7 port... works great."
2123,2,"So it took me a few minutes to figure out how to line up the little pins and the head thingy.  Once I had that under control, this works just fine.  Inserts and removes easily and the cord doesn't get in the way.  Just goes about its business and does what it is supposed to do."

2125,0,"I purchased a Fuji 3800 last year because it seemed like great value for money. Like many things that seem too good to be true, it was. Almost exactly a year after purchase, in which it was used sparingly, the camera went dead - it just would not turn on. By the time I got it to a repair center, the 1 year warranty period was over. The estimated repair cost including tax is $150 - I can get a decent new 3.2 MP camera for that price these days.While it lasted, it took decent photos. The 6x zoom which was a big selling point of the camera was fairly useful. Focusing in low light was difficult. Overall it felt too light and plasticky. With the breakdown, I'll never buy a Fuji again."
2126,0,"This device ONLY supports a 10base-t network. I just bought this unit and might have to return it unless I can figure out a way to make it work.Odd that a unit that relies on the network to receive music would not support 100mb networks. The more bandwidth the better, I say. Not likely to sell into any business that has 100mb only. I'd consider this a mistake and one that I did not expect in a network appliance at this time in networking where practically everything supports 10/100 based networks.Surprised and not impressed with that limitation...Something that should be fixed in any future version..."
2127,0,"Like another reviewer's, my experience has been mixed. I use this remote with the D50.Sometimes the remote works, then it goes on strike. Then suddenly it works again.

2132,1,"I bought the carrying case to use with the Garmin Street Pilot Deluxe package.  With the case you can snugly fit the Garmin Street Pilot unit alone. However, when trying to also put it the cigarette adapter/speaker, both don't fit without having the zipper on top partially opened.  Also, don't even consider trying to store the bean bag mount in the case.I do like the fact that the bottom of the case has a protective cushion so the unit can be stored face down.I think it would be nice if they had another sized bag -- one which can store the unit, adapter cable, plus the bean bag mount all together.  This would be the ideal size for those who want to carry the unit and all the accessories at once.Review update: The original review is for trying to hold the Street Pilot III with accessories.  The case does fit the newer smaller Garmin units. I was able to easily fit the Garmin Street Pilot 2620 with it's cigarette lighter adapter and remote control.  I also was able to add the external power adapter too -- but this was a bit tighter fit when the adapter was added in."

However, both computers seem unable to detect the resolution of the monitors when connected through the switch box, and they revert to an inappropriate configuration.  I expected the box to just be a pass-through.  I don't know what else is going on but since it doesn't deliver on it's basic purpose I'm giving it a poor one star."
2134,0,"..., and I am giving the manufacturer [time] to produce firmware that solves my problems. Otherwise, I return it. Why? An 802.11b (WI-FI) compliant device must be able to work with other compliant devices, regardless of brand. This one doesn't in my experience. A router should not reset itself randomly.For one, I have already upgraded the firmware twice (1.1 to 2.0f, 2.0f to 2.03), and it is still flaky. Two, I have been unable to get a Cisco Aironet 340 PCMCIA Card to Associate (one that works on other networks). Three, a Compaq WL100 PCMCIA Card will Associate, but, it has obtained an IP address only once in over 100 Associations! Four, the router appears to reset itself, irregardless of configuration; this means that even my wired PC connections lose access to the WAN. This latter has nothing to do with my ability to configure the unit. ..."
2135,2,"I love my ETX-90, but putting it on an object manually can be a literal pain in the neck. That's because the straight through viewfinder, which great for terrestial viewing, is not so good when you're trying to look up at the stars. (I assume this is why it is standard on th ETX-125 since that is more of an 'astronomy' scope).The good news is this viewfinder makes finding things easier because you're look angle is the same for the view finder and the eyepiece. The bad news is that you're most comfortable view is to tilt it off to the side (away from the eyepiece) and that makes &quot;driving&quot; the scope non-intuitive. I also found it harder to align than the straight through finder.On the bright side this leaves you with the original viewfinder as a nice spotting scope for your younger astronomers."
2136,2,It works great but I am hardly in front of the camera.  I always have to reach over the camera.
2137,1,"I got this mouse a year and a month ago. It has started working erratically when it was about a year old. When I tried to close one tab on my browser it would close the whole browser. It would jump around and just act bad. I've replaced it but I still miss it. Or I miss what it was like when new. But I think a mouse should last more than 13 months. Even the old friction ball mice would last longer, especially one that cost $30. There's no way to take it apart, clean it out and fix it. It was just a waste of money."
2138,0,"What you don't find out until you get the package is this holder is not waterproof.  Really would have liked to have known that before I bought it.Edit 3/24/10I bought 2 other brands this week.  Can't name them in reviews, but both are tough enough not to flex when pushed with your thumb, one could be stood on.  Both have steel pins built into both the hinge and the clasp, and do not rely on plastic being bent over and over and over as a structural part.  Both of them will stay not only floating in water, but held under water for 10-15 minutes with no leakage.Good luck to those that did not think my original review mentioning water proofing as being important.  Please let us all know how much 4 CF cards are worth once they are water soaked.  (And how the pictures came out!)"
2139,0,"Bought this to be able to switch between my computer and my Xbox 360 using one monitor, but the problem is there is no manual switch and the 360 does not have a keyboard so therefore we can not switch between the two.  Right now trying to find a work around."
2140,2,"Good solid earbuds. The sound is surprisingly good, really a step up from the cheap sony $9.99 earbuds. They are very comfortable, and stay in your ear well. I can't stand the feeling of that coarse foam that is used on most headphones, so these are a great alternative.  Also, the 4' cord is nice, compared to most other earbuds that only have a 3' cord. The only potential problem I see, is that the cord is fairly small gage wire, hope it doesn't break, but they do have a lifetime warranty."
2141,0,"I used it for 2 yrs (from 2012 to 2014). Then it stopped working.I found out that I needed an updated software.I tried to update it from the Logitech website, but still could never get it to work right."
2142,0,"Bought the mouse for a Dell Inspiron 600 because of size and retractable cord.  The size fits in a laptop case easily and is far less bulky than others.  While very small, it works well on small tables, on the computer itself and on an airplace tray.  But, the lock on the cord rewind device broke within one month and I now have to tie a knot in the cord on both sides of the rewind section to keep it from snapping back against the computer when no in use.  It didn't really cost that much, but, as it turned out, it was a waste of money.  I no longer use it.  When it worked, I would rate it a 5; broken a 0."
2143,2,"There are two schools of thought on the use of go-to telescopes.  One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy.  however, I'm a believer in the other viewpoint.  I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone.  I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use.  Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope, I estimate it has performed as desired on 90% of my viewing nights.  Unusually, I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty.  I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX, while a beautiful scope, can be a little temperamental.  Even after doing a quick and rough alignment, like pointing it in the general direction of due North, without using a compass, I still get very accurate results with the autostar.  I even changed locations the other day, moving from Auckland to Taupo, (some 3 hrs travel distance by car) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo.  Suprisingly after alignment, I still got accurate positioning from the autostar.  Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around.  The amount of data is staggering, but given the size of the playground, it's not suprising.  The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark.  I havn't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc.  The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score.  I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod, you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it. Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way.  On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself. These have been far and few between, and readily fixed itself.  Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected.  One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls.  This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating. This however is only a minor niggle. If you have any concerns about your Autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar, Mike Weasners site. The Autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your ETX. Clear skies everyone and happy alignments."
2144,0,"I purchased this headset in December 2012 from Amazon and I'm having to order another one less than a year later.  The mic apparently went out and no one can hear me.  Prior to the mic going out, people were hearing a lot of static during conversations which was a prelude to a total failure of the mic I assume.  For the price though I still give it 3 stars and I'm ordering it again because aside from that issue, it's good.  My only other complaint would be the cord which is constantly getting wrapped around itself.  I have to unplug it from the phone and stretch the cord out a couple times a week.**UPDATE** May 9, 2014.  My 2nd headset broke.  The plastic adjustable piece which slides up and down for placement on the head broke.  I have wrapped a twisty tie around it to help hold it in place but they really need to correct this problem.  I was about to order two more because I DO like them and it's a good idea to have a spare because they only last a few months.  However the price has gone up from just under $10 to over $13.  So I changed my mind and got the Plantronics M220C for under $10.  I still prefer something that goes over my head and with a padded ear piece, but unless that have improved the plastic quality with the increased price, I would not spend almost $14 for this.  Based on my experiences now with 2 of them, I am reducing my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars.If you still want to try this, go ahead, but if you like it, order another immediately as a backup because you will likely need it in the not too distant future."
2145,2,I have had mine for over a year now and it still works great.  It comes with a good long lasting battery the NP-FM50.My only complaint is that the included memory stick is only 4MB.  At high resolution (1600x1200) you would only be able to take about 4 pictures.  I bought a 64MB stick the very same day and have had great success.

2149,0,"I've had Linksys router for several years, replaced an older version of WRT54G with a newer model, but both models were giving problems:* DHCP did not work well with Mac OS_X computers.  I had to manually assign IP addresses and DNS settings to make things work.* The range of the router was really poor, and I had to purchase an additional anntennae for $50 to make the signal reach through several walls into my living room.* Router would poorly support WPA and would hang the connection from time to time.  I had to power-cycle the router to make my connections work again.After finally getting fed up with the constant slew of problems, I replaced my router with D-Link DIR-625 and I couldn't be happier.  The web admin interface is way easier to use, more up-to-date and offers a lot more features.  I can easily assign static IPs on my LAN to some computers (such as network print server), and make others dynamic. I can forward ports from outside to local computers, and I can even have a server on the DMZ.  This is SO much better router, than I am amazed that so many people still buy linksys.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS ROUTER."
2150,2,"After hearing the crisp, full sound of my cousin's Koss PortaPro Headphones, I had to buy a pair of my own, especially after the fact that my awesome old Skullcandy headphones failed after 2 1/2 years of service.Awesome, they arrived 4 days earlier than originally projected, so I open the box to find a shiny new pair of Koss PortaPros. I had about 5 minutes to sample the awesomeness before I had to go to work, so I fold them up (neat design, by the way)and fit them into the tight (as in physical, not fashionable) carrying pouch and set them on my dresser.The next day, I have more time to actually use these guys, so I pull them out of the pouch. This is where I need to warn buyers before getting these headphones.THE POUCH IS TOO TIGHT, WHEN YOU PULL THE HEADPHONES OUT, NO MATTER HOW CAREFUL YOU DO IT, ONE OR BOTH OF THE EARPIECES WILL SNAP WHERE IT SWIVELS.[...]UPDATE: NEVER MIND THE WARRANTY IS AMAZING!"
2151,0,"Appears to be well-made. Directions say to interrupt your computer from automatically finding and installing a driver, and to use the included CD.  Which I wasn't quick enough to interrupt, being under the table plugging it in to my computer.  So I had to delete the driver and start over.  It still wouldn't work despite some troubleshooting.  Win 7 on a Dell desktop."
2152,1,"Overall, I picked this item for two reasons: 1.) It is 14-Guage, which is essential when running a connecting length greater than 50 feet. 2.) I assumed that RCA was one of the higher quality brands to pick. Unfortunately, I was wrong about the overall quality of the cable. After purchasing this item, I realized that it was not solid copper but CCA (Copper Clad Aluminum). I used this wire strictly for my two rear speakers, so I am overall happy with the results versus cost. Still, if I could do it all again, I would have spent more money for a higher quality cable."
2153,2,"I bought my G6 in December, borrowed a Canon 420 EX speedlite and liked the results but I wondered if the smaller, lighter, less expensive 220 EX would be good enough?  Some of the reviews here say it is underpowered.  Is it?  I bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in 8 PM darkness to try them at 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet and 40 feet on the G6.Conclusion #1:  The G6 has a good builtin flash.  It makes good images within it's limited range of 5 meters/16 feet (or 4 meters/13 feet when the lens is set to telephoto) and works well as a fill flash.  Complete failure beyond 20 feet.Conclusion #2:  The 420EX (range 24.2 meters) and the 220EX (range 15.7 meters/51.5 feet) both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range.  But both are limited by the autofocus range of 5 to 7 meters.  That's right, neither flash can focus on a subject more than 20 feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto.  Both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at 40 feet.Final Conclusion:  I'm keeping the 220 EX.  The G6 is small and light, so is the 220EX.  They make a good team, but the G6 also does well alone up close."
2154,2,"They are clear, crisp, and have just the right amount of bass.  You can't ask for any better sound from this style of headphone.  I have actually made a couple friends very angry when I told them to try my headphones, then ask what they cost, and then complain that they sound better than their $300 Sennheisers........"
2155,2,"This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings."
2156,0,"I am owning an iQue 3600 right now, and this is the first GPS that I own. I thought that Garmin would make a very decent and reliable product such as the iQue 3600, since they are in the GPS business for a while. I am so dissappointed. This is a list of my experiences with Garmin iQue 3600:1. Battery life is terrible. If you play around with it, e.g., entering data, waypoints, etc., the battery drains so fast.2. I don't like one-touch keyed-on power. Whenever something hit the pouch that contains the iQue 3600, the unit will automatically be turned on. This is not so bad, except that the unit could get reset accidentally. I prefer a total control on the power button, i.e., when I want it on, I mean to turn it on. Otherwise if I want it off, it should be off. No accidental turn-on.3. The unit keeps being reset all the time. It occured to me almost everyday, whenever I take it off the auto/car mount. The automatic reset also occurs when there is static and you are touching it.4. Slotting the stylus in and out its slot also creates resetting sometimes. It happened to me about 3-4 times. Again, I suspect that there is static developing when the stylus is moving in or out its slot. This is only my speculation.5. There is no mechanism to save waypoints, addresses, and data to the SD card instead of the unit's memory. So even in the case that I have a memory wipe-out due to a reset, I still have all the data intact. If I am not incorrect, the access of the data from the SD card to internal memory or buffers for calculation happens only once, so storing data on the SD card should not slow down the calculation and/or the unit's timely updates/responses. I don't know what Garmin's engineers have been thinking!6. There is no such thing that I call ""on-field user-friendly features."" Garmin can make a scroll up/down button to select waypoint items (and a push-in would make a select) instead of using stylus to point. In a car, when you are travel, searching for waypoints/addresses would be a hassle if user has to use stylus to point to (a little tiny) a line on screen. This ""stylus action"" requires concentration and sometimes two hands. Why can't they make it for one-hand operation, i.e., scrolling up/down and then pushing in to select the desired item?7. Opening the antenna of the unit is really a hassle. The slot reserved for your finger is too small. Again, what have Garmin's engineers been thinking? Haven't they tested a prototype before making it into a full production?Don't get me wrong. The GPS has many good features, but I think this iQue 3600 needs more considerations into its design.I would definitely wait for the future generation if I have another chance."
2157,0,"Nice design and good looking. (Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards, just another way for Fuji/Oly to rip off consumers. What was wrong with standard SD or CF cards? Imagine the chaos if every manufacturer used different memory cards.Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta. This camera has nothing special warrant this high price tag."
2158,1,"I purchased this as an addition to my existing DVD player to play SVCDs I made from home videos.  I picked this one because it was fairly cheap and some reviews said it would play SVCDs.  The one I got didn't play them at all.  It turns out that to play SVCDs in this machine, you have to burn them with a special hack to make the machine think they are VCD (lower quality).  What a hassle. The medium rating is only because it didn't do SVCDs specifically.  As a DVD player it worked fine and was good for the money."
2159,0,"I could not agree more on the issue brought up here. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good..Update: It seems most people didn't appreciate my comments years ago, but now even Fuji seems to agree with me as their newer cameras I saw were using sD. Y'all are just hatin' on a prophet!!"
2160,2,"I bought two  Fuji FinePix A101 a few days ago, and I have to say it is a good camera. It is accessible (cheap) and easy to use, one big advantage is that downloads pictures really fast.Maybe is not an impressive camera, but it is very useful."
2161,2,"After attending a local photography workshop, it was recommended to purchase a remote camera trigger. I was tempted to get the wireless trigger but decided on this as the price was better. I also didn't see the point in a wireless remote. Unless I'm in the scene, there is no reason to be worried about cables since if I'm using this remote, I'm using it while my camera is on a tripod and I'm not in the shot. This will allow you to get slightly sharper pictures by helping prevent camera shake."
2162,0,"I've used this for over a year and never suspected until reading here that all my troubles seem to be because the external power hook-up is to power the always on useless green lights, and not to supply extra power to the ports.  If this is true, then no wonder my external drives would sometimes disconnect at random, or my iPad would not charge reliably.  Ugh, if only I'd known earlier.  Why would they make something like that except into fooling you it's something it's not.  Very disappointed!  Oh well, I'll miss the Christmas tree effect of the useless green lights at nite, but not my external hard drives going off line at random."

Aside from my mistake, the batteries delivered to my house was not encased like in the picture, causing a minor doubt if the product is new or not.  The initial image of the product is a little misleading.  Otherwise, they were easy to return.  Next time, I would buy batteries that are enclosed in the original packaging, just in case."
2165,0,"These are so popular I really thought they would be better.My first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly, the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears, which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about 45-60mins. I tried adjusting them every which way but It seems I needed to modify the pads.My second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about 3 months of very light use. I never put them too loud and never dropped them. They sat on my head or my desk always. Really sucks to have them die out so quickly.Sound quality wise these are OK. They definitely were detailed and quick accurate, but they definitely lacked the sound quality I expected. They also were very anemic in the bass department, it was almost non-existent.I now use the Sennheiser HD-360 (in the link) and enjoy them much much more. Very comfortable, better sounding, and cheaper.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I0SCD72/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00I0SCD72&linkCode;=as2&tag;=nealo10a-20&linkId;=Q52NQGHSMAOFG5XH"

The display was blinking about an hour before switching the power off after recharging.The sound was good though, there's nothing to say about.Remote is too small and a little confusing to operate.I think this player is not ready for mass production, or maybe it's just a defective item.Whoever is going to buy this player, please be aware of the issues described above."
2167,1,"If you are truly interested in a quality portable DVD player, I would shy away from this one. However, that was not my intensions when I purchased this item. I wanted a relatively inexpensive (less than $ 30.00) DVD player that I could hook up to any TV and watch pre-recorded and recorded DVD movies when I was out of town and on the road. You can accomplish that with this player (via a RF modulator and some A/V cable and coax cable). I did not want to spend $150.00 - $300.00 on a portable DVD player.The good: This unit is very portable, small, compact and lightweight. It is not very expensive and it has a fairly well know brand name attached to it (Koss). It has played every DVD and CD I used in it, including the ones I recorded myself utilizing my computer or my stand alone home Panasonic DVD recorder. It delivers a pretty good picture quality and the sound quality is not bad either. Of course, all this depends on the quality of the television set you have in home, or in my case, your hotel room (UGH).Now for the bad: After about 45 minutes to an hour of continuous playing time, the picture and sound starts to ""freeze"". Afterwhich, the unit discontinues to play any further. This is an inherient problem with all these units. Just read all the other reviews below. The unit get too hot to properly load and play any DVD or CD. Period. So you are warned. It does not run on batteries, only A/C. You have to hook up a lot of wires to make it go (power cord, RF Modulator, coax cable, A/V wires, etc...) It does not have it's own screen and/or it's own internal speakers (but then again, what do you expect for the price).I knew about the overheating problem beforehand by just reading the reviews of others prior to purchasing it. But, for $ 30.00 I figured how can you go wrong. My solution to this problem was to purchase a small 4"" fan ($3.97 at WalMart), place the DVD player on a small cup to allow the air to circulate around the top and bottom of the unit, and direct the air towards the back of the unit. Do not place the DVD player directly on a tabletop and definetly not on any soft item. Too much heat is generated in the unit and the player cannot dissipate the heat quickly enough function properly.I also purchased the extended warranty for this unit, since it only comes with a 90 day warranty period. For $ 5.99 you can get a full replacement warranty for up to a year. Well worth it because this unit has a high probiblity of failing completely within a year, if you plan on using it a lot.All in all, 3 stars is a fair rating for this product. It works to accomplish all my objective (although I have to help it along a bit). And as I said earlier, you can't beat the price."
2168,0,"I ordered these for travel.  I discovered they were hard to stay on the ear.  And only one worked; the other did not.  Poor quality; expected more from the ""sony"" brand."
2169,0,"I bought this card for my Canon S400, as it was listed as one of the accessaries for that camera (got lazy that day). We've taken no more than 200 shots when we started getting image slots marked as &quot;incompatible jpeg format&quot; all over.I went on the SimpleTech webpage. One can't just send an email to them--one has to fill out a form and give out home phone# etc, and the FAQ (which one has to dig for) doesn't seem to have an answer.I've thrown out the package, so I guess I can't return it. How annoying.I will never buy another SimpleTech product again."
2170,1,"Over all, no complaints about the product.  It works as advertised.  However, the licensing is not well advertised at all.  You buy the whole CD titled Bluechart Americas, which contains the whole of Americas.  However, only slivers of that can be activated with the license.  For example, I live in the pacific northwest and that is the only regions I have access to.  I cannot, without buying another license, use the charts for southern california or the gulf coast.  I think that is bogus.So, buy it with both eyes wide open.  If I had known, I still would have made the purchase but I just wouldn't be as ticked off."
2171,1,"I needed closed-ear headphones for noise isolation (working in a lab) and also good sound. These model has both. The ambient noise was reduced significantly (equipment noise, people talking). The sound was very good, noticeably better than my cheaper HD-515. Other nice things are a coiled cord, decent materials and design.However these headphones are very uncomfortable because of the pressure on the head. Plus I wear glasses so be aware that this may be a factor. I tried them in different positions for a couple of hours, then finally gave up with a huge headache. Will be returning, unfortunately."
2172,2,"Almost too little for a backpack. It just doesn't sit well on the handsome build I had :) Plenty of compartments, excellently built & high quality too. Remember this only holds a mini-tripod, not a normal sized one."
2173,2,"If you love the bass in the music, this is your headphones! This is a real killer with high expression of basses, high quality sound, good noise-blocking, comfy (but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour, it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time), light-weighted and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews, pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connection.I strongly recommend the product. Especially given its price..."
2174,2,"I've had these for a few months now and I'm very satisfied. Great sound quality, very comfortable, and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market. So 5 stars from me!"
2175,2,"This kit is pretty nice and helped me hide wiring that goes up along a wall to my projector, as well as some speaker and sub woofer wiring around a door frame. The included 3 pieces of the cord channel were just enough for my application, but just barely. One kit will probably not be enough for most applications.The pieces fit together nicely, the connectors are handy, and everything looks neat. The adhesive is fairly strong, which I found out when I tried to unstick a piece of the channel because it was flush against the door molding, and a connector wasn't fitting around it as a result.Each channel should comfortably fit 2 coax size cables, but not too much more.My biggest gripe with the product is the quality of the plastic where the channel hinges open. When I got mine, part of it was already cracked along the length of the hinge. While I was cutting another one shorter, I pressed down on the top of the channel while holding it down, and it just cracked through in that spot too. After that I was careful about how I held the pieces and avoided additional grief, but perhaps the plastic should be a bit thicker or less brittle to prevent this.Fortunately, the cracks weren't too visible and the product got the job done, so only one star lost!"
2176,0,Just be very careful not to drop it. I did and now the photos are always out of focus. Will probably buy again.
2177,1,"I bought this DVD player because I wanted one with component video and 5.1 audio outputs. The price can't be beat, I've been happy with my other Apex 660 DVD player, and you can upgrade the AD-800's firmware (except for some early models) to be ""region free"" - so you can play foreign DVDs (see nerd-out.com). It even automatically converts PAL DVDs to NTSC. The firmware upgrade also allows you to defeat macrovision copy protection.If these things are important to you, I think you'll be happy. I am. I can only give it 3 stars, though, because of some irritating, though not deal-breaking, flaws. They shipped the unit preset with a color setting inappropriate for the US - at least I *think* that's what was wrong. The result of this was that I got a black and white display when I first connected the unit to my TV. Fortunately, I had read (I think here) that you just have to change the color setting in the setup menu. It took me maybe an hour (I don't even remember which settings I selected), but I finally got it to work. It was frustrating as [...], especially when the display went wacky and I had to get back to the original settings without being able to see the on-screen menu, but I managed to get it done, and wow does the picture look good using component video (get the special component video cables - ordinary video cables don't work).Another thing that is poorly thought-out is the location of the ""Setup"" button. On the right side of the DVD drawer is the ""Open/Close"" button. On the left is the ""Setup"" button. Do you think you might get mixed up now and then, and hit the wrong button? How on Earth they could have decided to put a button you will probably want use only on the first day you buy the machine in a location where you will routinely mistake it for the button you want to use every time you insert a DVD is a great mystery. It's one of the bone-headedest things I've ever encountered on a piece of electronic equipment.I'm happy with the unit, though, because the picture looks great, the sound is great, and it's [inexpensive]."
2178,0,"I purchased this switchbox so that I could toggle between at 15"" computer monitor and a 40"" flat screen TV without changing the cable on the back of the computer each time.  I installed the cables, turned the switch and heard an audible click.  When I turned the switch back there was no sound, but around 15 seconds later, there was a very faint click.  As I toggled back and forth between the displays using the switchbox, only the monitor hooked to the setting that had the audible click would display correctly.  So, back it went.  In summary, not a good product.  Tried to give NO STARS, but I guess you can't. :("
2179,0,"This product is a great idea, however the execution is very poor.The idea is that the iRock can broadcast the audio from any device that has a headphone jack (such as your discman, walkman, or iPod) on one of four FM frequencies (88.1 / 88.3 / 88.5 or 88.7) for a short distance (a few feet, which should be plenty to reach your radio antenna from inside your car).  Since FM fidelity typically exceeds that of cassette, it should be better for your car than a cassette adapter.The iRock does not live up to its promise.  At least in the area where I live (Los Angeles), there are stations occupying all four of the frequencies that the iRock uses.  I won't go into the physics of it all, but basically a low powered FM broadcast at extremily short range should completely overpower an FM signal from a powerful radio station miles away.  In fact, a friend of mine once assembled a small FM transmitter from a kit very similar to the iRock using a 9V battery that did exactly that.Unfortunately, the iRock's signal is not sufficiently strong to reliably overpower another radio station.  The sound quality varies wildly depending on conditions and even moving the iRock a few inches or changing its orientation a small bit can dramatically impact the audio quality.  Often in my car, I HEAR the other radio station underneath (or even over) the music I'm trying to broadcast from the iRock.In the end, buying a car cassette adapter is a much better use of anyone's money.  It might not offer quite the same level of fidelity as FM, but at least you will hear your music clearly and consistently."
2180,0,"Was so excited about this but when I received the mini plug didn't fit my iPhone as it said it would, so don't order for your iPhone."
2181,1,"My suspicion is that most of the stellar reviews here are written by individuals who expected less.Some background:I've owned computers since I purchased my first in 1985, an Amiga (for those who weren't born, yet.I've had my share of &#34;computer speakers and most were lacking in one way or another.  I usually wait until I simply can't stand the sound for another day and then start shopping.  My last speaker set (purchased eight years ago) was a Links Computer, LTD LK-5000 with Sub woofer and satellites.  Had a great sound with adjustable base (like they do, today).  It became scratchy, distorted, and then pitifully unbearable.I did chose this product in the same fashion that I always purchase things on the Internet:  based on product description, price, and customer reviews.  If there isn't a good product description, or no customer reviews, I move on in my search.Having said that, this speaker set compares to my LK-5000 system in clarity and function.  I paid $69.99 for my LK set and, at $139., this (in my mind) was expensive but, I had to justify getting them, anyway.I don't know if you'll be satisfied but, I doubt that you'll be dis-satisfied."
2182,0,"I am a fan of D-Link network hardware for the home, but I just got rid of this hub after many years of tedious ownership. I also don't normally rate devices with 1 star just because I don't like them. I just don't see how this device could do what it claims to do.The hub was a frequent pain, especially when trying to run some devices concurrently with high-power devices like encrypted USB keys. I would have to unplug one device to use another. I finally gave up when the thing just would not initialize in Windows correctly anymore when fully loaded.Before it apparently failed, if I plugged in a high-power device alongside the key, it would sometimes disconnect the key or cause it behave erratically. One possible reason was that 7 ports running at a full 0.5A power each would require 3.5A, but the power adapter that came with the hub was only good for 3.0A. Considering that it would also draw some power to function and to power those always-on status lights, there seems to be no way it could power 7 ports concurrently.The lights on that hub were also useless because they were always on, even when devices weren't plugged in, so I'm not sure what the point of them was.Bear in mind that it's possible there have been multiple hardware revisions of this hub, so it's hard to know whether the above problems exist in the current model, but it's something to consider.I just got rid of this hub and replaced it with a Belkin F4U107, which has none of the above problems (it has a 3.8A power adapter, no status lights, and looks nice on the desk). I am charging 3 devices concurrently as I type, and have all ports loaded."
2183,0,"I ordered 2 of these USB extensions.With USB 2.0 devices (5 devices tested) one cable worked sometimes and the second cable worked rarely.With USB 1.1/1.0 devices (USB mice and keyboard) both cables worked fine.Be warned, these are not high speed cables."
2184,0,"It's extremely unfortunate but I can't help looking at this as a predatory product. There's no good reason to make the camera require a proprietary design to begin with but then to charge this much money for it -- it's insulting. The quality is fine but for less than half the cost, you can buy a charger plus four AA batteries and recharge them galore. Heck, you could buy three more sets of perfectly good AA batteries and never ever run out of juice.I'm a Canon fan but enough is enough. The camera's Excellent, the lenses are Fair to Good, the AC adapter is a bad buy for the money."
2185,0,Some buttons on this like the eject button does not work with the latest Mac software.  There is no sofware update to fix this problem either.  Dont buy this.
2186,2,I've been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them.  They greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely.  I especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation!
2187,0,"This product does not work with Windows Vista.  When I got it it would not install properly.  I went to D-Link's web site to see if there was an updated driver but it showed that they did not have drivers for Vista.  I called D-Link's sales department, as it is impossible to get to a ""live person"" in their technical support department, and the sales rep told me that they do not have a driver for this device for use on PCs running Vista."
2188,1,"The Microsoft Natural line of keyboards are the best keyboards on the market, in my opinion.That said, there are a couple things about this keyboard that for me take it from a 5-star rating to a 3-star:The wrist-rest is plastic, and short. The plastic part is more offensive than the short length, in this case. It feels awful and cheap, but it's not a deal breaker.The arrow-directional keys are not in the standard position, or like they are on other Microsoft natural Keyboards, which is odd. This is done to make it a diminished footprint, I think. In any case, I don't like it.The Key Mapping is somewhat different from other Microsoft Natural keyboards, but it isn't a big deal.I dig the design-aesthetic of the black model a lot, in how it looks on my black glass desk.I use this as my back-up keyboard and as a keyboard for a second machine. For normal every day use as a primary keyboard I use and recommend theMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000."
2189,2,This mouse worked pretty well and replaced a junky e-Machines bundled mouse that wouldn't function anymore.  Don't buy e-Machines anything unless you want to be ripped off.
2190,2,"I own several pairs of headphones and earbuds, ranging in price from $20 to over $500.  I've had a pair of these Koss PortaPro headphones for several months now, and used them on PCs for games and on an iPhone and an iPad for games, music and video.  These headhones have great sound with all the devices.  I like them so well that I just ordered 2 more pair.  It would be hard to beat them for the price."
2191,2,I have been using this remote for well over a year. it is a low priced but good IR remote for compatible canon cameras
2192,2,"For an earbud these are amazing.  The sound quality rivals much larger, heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphones.They key is being sure you position them properly.  You'll know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong.  To get the most out of these, compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears.  Twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear sound.The lifetime warranty is a plus.For the price these represent a truly great value"
2193,1,It's a decent product in that the audio is great in quality but in my 2003 Toyota Camry it makes a loud clicking sound every second which is hard to drown out with the music or whatever.
2194,1,"I purchased these speakers for use as my side channels in my 7.1 surround sound system. I was surprised at how easy they were to install. I'd rate my ""handiness"" skill as amaturish at best, but a friend and I were able to get these installed in the ceiling and working in under 1 hr.  The hardest part was cutting the hole in the ceiling.  The speakers come with a cardboard stencil to draw the line for the cut and the design of the speaker itself is pretty forgiving in case you're not so hot with the drywall saw. Once the hole was in the ceiling, the speakers go in and after a quick twist of the screwdriver, they're in.They sound pretty good for ceiling speakers and they definitely serve my purpose as side channels.  I probably wouldn't opt to use them as my primary speakers, but they're not bad. I'm considering buying another set or two to set up a whole home system for music and install them in the bedroom and the office.Pros: Ease of installation, they look great and sound pretty goodCons: They're not going to replace your main speakers, and although they say that they're paintable, painting the grill requires you to use spray paint so not to gum up the grill. This may make it difficult to match your existing paint. I didn't paint mine, but they still look really good in their original white and match my light switch and outlet covers."
2195,0,"The sounds is just too low.  No volume control, and no mute either.  I knew I shouldn't have deviated from the Plantronics.  Placed order for Plantronics after this... very disappointing."
2196,1,"I bought these as a replacement for a home stereo system that used a receiver, 2 satellites, and a sub which I moved to another room.  I have these plugged directly into a Technics record player.  They definitely sound good but as a home stereo replacement, I think they are a little lacking in body or mid range.  I know they are designed as ""computer speakers"", and they are very good for that, but they are pretty expensive compared to the sound I get out of my $40 Altec-Lansing 2.1 set I use at work...which I think is also very good.Overall, I feel like you can hear the small size of the speakers and that the sub is too responsible for filling out the sound in the mid range.  To my ear, they don't blend very well...as in, I feel like I can hear the music from the sub and the music from the satellites separately.  Don't get me wrong, the set sounds good, it's just that if you are looking to use this as a home stereo replacement, I think you're better off buying a receiver and some larger speakers which I wish I would have done.In summary, they are too expensive for computer speakers (for my budget), and they are too undersized for a home stereo replacement."
2197,2,"Beautifully soft and comfortable, cone-shaped earphones, and the only ones I've ever found that don't keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do. Good sound quality, and excellent price, with the superb Koss reputation behind them."
2198,0,"When I received my first unit I thought at first glance that it was an unbelievably good bargain.  It looked great and performed really well... for about four hours.  Then the motor started to randomly speed up and slow down, of course destroying the pitch and sound of the music.  I figured this couldn't happen again, so I shipped it back and received a second unit which ALSO performed well for about the same length of time before it went bad.  I also noted that the belt used on this model is very small and thin, although this wasn't the source of the problem.  Both of these units were manufactured in March, 2008 and may have been part of a unique production batch that received defective motors, but I wasn't willing to give it a third try.  I have a friend who has a slightly more expensive Audio Technica model and he's been very happy with his.  I suggest you go for a nicer model if you want to be problem-free."
2199,2,"I received this unit less than a month ago and gave it 5 Stars. Then it failed on me and I had to send it back. Amazon replaced it with their usual 'superior customer service.'-Many of the comments appear to be from 'professional reviewers' so I read them with a grain of salt. No matter what people say you're not going to get over 10 miles on 4 Watts of power. Here are my Pros and Cons.-Pros - It's a small unit with many useful features. ANL, Gain, volume and squelch controls on the front and a PA outlet on the rear. When I first hooked it up I had an almost perfect impedance with my SWR meter. It gave out 4 Watts and had crystal clear audio. I can't impress enough that a 'good' antenna is imperative.-Cons - The stock mic is cheaply made with passable modulation. The mic cord is very short, but I can live with that. Since linear amps are a 'No-No' get a decent power mic if you want to be heard."
2200,0,They don't work at all in my Lenovo W500 Laptop with Windows XP and Media PLayer 11 - I have wasted 10 or more until I worked out that  ....... they work just fine in my wife's Dell 1501 with Windows 7 and Media PLayer 12.I can't explain why; some reviews speculate it is the CD drive.
2201,0,"I can only say that you need to be assured that this card will work with your computer! This card's terminals/slot do not line up with my 4-year-old Dell 4700. In all fairness, however, Dell is known to use suppliers that supply ""unusual"" configurations. For example, Dell printer ink could only be purchased from Dell because other cartridges would not fit/work."
2202,2,"Do you wanna look like a jogger from 1982?  Do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time?  These are your headphones.  Seriously, they sound excellent."
2203,2,"Great range and ease of use.  Set the camera to ""remote"", point and click the button on the remote.  Focus and photo are taken, and you have a lasting image.  My only reason for not being a 5* is the price- but it's Canon, what should I expect?"
2204,0,"Even with their most recent firmware release my problems are still present.I have 2 PCs with their AirPlus PCI nics and a laptop with a thirdparty wireless nic.  My top of the line Toshiba laptop w/ integrated wireless nic constantly experiences network outages.  The signal strength and quality is excellent, yet the network drops at least once a minute and then reconnects shortly thereafter.  I even went as far as to reinstall the O/S.The PCs with the AirPlus nics seem to be working great though.They seemed to have fixed the bandwidth problem and I am finally getting some decent download speeds.If you plan on using a third-party nic, do not buy this router.This item should never have been released with the major problems that it has/had.  Too many people have had issues with this router.When I contacted tech support last time (which was useless), and I told them I was using their feature to not broadcast the SSID, the gentleman asked &quot;why&quot;.  I told him because its a great security feature and I want to use it!  He said you dont need that and basically told me not to use it, not explaining why when I asked him.  I went as far to tell him, you provide a feature and you don't even support it?  This feature does not work.I will personally never buy another D-Link product.  I don't even want to sell this item on E-Bay because I don't want to stick someone else with this inferior product."
2205,1,"I purchased this bag for my Asus 1201n net book (which is great). This is a no-fills bag. the 1201n fits snugly, almost too snugly. It's a bit of a squeeze getting the net book into the case. I had to be careful to avoid scratching the 1201n on the zipper.As mentioned in other reviews, there is very little room for accessories. I'm able to fit the power supply and a relatively small Logitech Bluetooth mouse in the front pouch. But that's about it.If I had to do it again, I might consider a case/bag with more storage options."
2206,0,"I have had this camera for just over a year. 8/14/03 is the purchase date. I used it a total of 12 times for maybe 20 minutes max, kept it locked up when not in use, and now it doesn't work.  I paid extra for Sony ""quality"".  There were other cameras I would have rather had (cheaper, more compact with more features) but bought the sony because of Consumer Reports listing Sony's as having low occurances of repairs.  One thing I did like better when this camera was working was the nightshot feature.  It was much better than the night shot feature on the Panasonic GS-15 I just bought to replace the Sony.I called Sony and they offered my a flat fee of 269.00.  Not willing to throw good money after bad because I have already spent over 600.00 dollars on a camera that only lasted a year with only a few uses."
2207,1,"My doubts proofed right. No major improvements compared to the 505 device. It's easy so become familiar with this handheld, but you won't be satisfied with the rather small range of applications and the poor software lineup. Don't know, why Palm is always boasting about their products. They are no match for an up-to-date pocket PC. You could expect more value for your money. The CPU is definately outdated and the display's iow resolution makes serious applications still unavaillable for Palm users. Though I own a 515 now, but I don't think I'll use it very often. Rather stick to my Compaq 3870 - it's heavy and too big but it gets done all thinkable tasks.The Palm 515 is not really bad, but it makes you feel naked when confronted with complex tasks that require professional software solutions. It's just an organizer - a very flash one of course."
2208,2,They are cable ties.  They work for me.  They were just an add on to get my free shipping so I really didnt take a loss if they didn't work.
2209,0,I bought one of the Windows Ipods when they first came out and have had nothing but trouble with the software for downloading music and books (Audible).  Music and books would have gaps or be completly unplayable.  I would advise looking at the user comments on Apples own web site before buying one of these.
2210,2,"When I received the headphones I was pleasantly surprised. I had to find some that were cheap, as my Turtle Beach TBS-2052 Ear Force Z2 was damaged. I'm glad I listened to the good reviews I found.Surprisingly, the bass is deep, despite the size and type of headphones. If you like or not, that is a matter of personal taste. In my opinion, I had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good sound.One more thing: these headphones are not pretty, but its quality and durability are excellent."
2211,2,"To start out this is the second one of these flashes that I have purchased in the last couple of years.  My first one (~3 years old) is still going strong and has seen a lot of use and some abuse ;)  On the downside the plastic shoe mount is worrying but has not given me any issues to date and I do use this on light stands and with triggers that attach to the shoe mount.  This flash is also best used in full manual mode with settings to full, half, quarter, and 1/16 power.  It would be very nice if the settings would go lower...1/32 and 1/64 would be awesome and I would never buy another type of flash ;)  To overcome this you can buy very cheap ND gels that slip right into the slot and provide a power reduction but be cautioned firing off shots too quickly while gels are in place as I have melted a couple this way.  As far as the good news goes these flashes are extremely powerful for the price you pay and they just plain work.  My much more expensive SB600 will often times go into to sleep mode and not fire the first time I push the trigger...this guy will fire every time.  The only downside to this availability is battery life...keep batteries on hand and don't expect to be able to use rechargeables...for me they work but not for long at all.  Overall if you understand and accept the the limitations of this flash it will be an awesome piece of equipment for you.  If you come in expecting full functionality of much pricier units you will be disappointed."
2212,2,"These Koss PortaPro Headphones work great!  Normally the only thing I care about with headphones is how durable they are, though ever since I became an adult, and my head got bigger, I suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into consideration!I used to have REALLY horrible luck with headphones back in the 90's.  The headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so I'd have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back.  It was annoying.  This problem still exists from time to time, but these particular type of Koss headphones haven't been giving me this particular problem and I'm VERY happy about that.  Nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on, and BAM- the volume drops out from one side.I highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphones."
2213,0,"Sound quality is not that good.  I have trouble hearing people on the other end and they do not hear me so well. I am using it on a Panasonic cordless phone.  I like the convenience, but the sound quality is not really good enough."
2214,0,"These headphones sound great and at first fitting feel very secure. However, once you start running and bouncing, they will practically fall off your head and dangle from your ear. I'm not sure what non-slip means.  Anyway, if you are looking for comfortable headphones that sound pretty good and you aren't planning to run with them, go for it."
2215,2,"Most anywhere on the web you can find these for between $30 to $40 bucks and they are well worth it. I tend to be a bit of an audio snob but I'm using these on a cell phone and occasionally an Ipod. So I understand those aren't going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range.Even with that being the case I was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these. You don't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound. Bass is very strong, it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste. I listen to a wide range, from classical, to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay, the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced. This isn't to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these aren't going to do as good as they would for something like Mos-Def for whom these are exceptional. The construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but I can live with that because I'm concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are.If good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you'll understand why they're considered classics. For a $30 price you can get $100 sound."
2216,0,"BEWARE - THE NEW ONES ARE JUNK. The ones with black cords have a main button that has a hair trigger and doesn't click. I'm having to take them apart and unsolder the microswitches and move them around. Have wasted $100 buying many of these all from different vendors, can't find a good one. One was DOA, the ones with silver cords click but are way too slow.CONSIDER THIS A NO STARS REVIEW."
2217,2,"This in-line volume control can be used in several situations. As a wearable, it has a clip (like on a pen) so you can attach it to a pocket, sleeve or collar so it won't be flopping around like a cord mounted control.  In my case I used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds I wear while watching TV.The volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any setting.My only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger. That's probably a plus if you're wearing it as it's less likely to be moved by just brushing against it.It's well worth the price and I would buy it again"
2218,2,"I've had a terrible time finding headphones that I can wear for more than 5 minutes. First, I wear glasses, so that rules out a lot of ""over the ear"" headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head. The alternative, then, would be to use earbuds. I can't use earbuds though, because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child. I didn't think I had an alternative. Fortunately, I came across these.For comfort, these things are a dream. I actually forget that I'm wearing them sometimes, which is a first for any headset I've owned. The pressure is applied above the ears as much as I'd like (it's adjustable) and I can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my head.Durability-wise, they *seem* to be fragile--specifically, the part where the speakers connect to the headphone frame--however I've often stuffed them in my coat pockets (yes, they're that small when folded up) where they've been squished against my shoulder bag and I've dropped them several times. It's all part of being a klutz. I have yet to do any damage to them, however. That's more than I can say about my portable MP3 player.Complaints: The bag seems a bit small, even with the ""correct"" way you put them in. I would've liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily. I've stopped using it altogether, but I use them every day for at least an hour so it doesn't matter too much for me.As for quality of sound, they've been excellent for me. I listen to a wide variety of classical, rock, and world music, and it's handled all of them quite well. I don't know how this would compare to, say, a $100+ headset, but for the price listed or under I think it'd have to be the best out there. For comfort, I'm not sure if these can be beat."
2219,0,"So - this does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Without extensive testing, it does certainly provide a serial port over a USB connection, and even works well with a Windows 7-64 machine, which has always been a bit of a problem with similar devices.That said, there is a significant flaw with the device in the way that the retention devices are built on the serial port end of the cable.  This is, as can be seen from the images, a serial device that ends in a male DB-9 connector.  This is obviously good, as it can then connect to the vast majority of devices with female DB-9 connectors.  However, it is generally expected that the cable end will have SCREWS on it, and that the device that you are connecting to has NUTS on it, so that the screws from the cable can be tightened onto the nuts on the device.  Unfortunately, the Trendnet converter has nuts on the side of the serial cable.  As a result, the connector cannot be plugged into a socket which has nuts on it as well - the nuts on both ends will prevent the connector from being able to be seated in the socket.  In most cases, it is possible to remove the nuts from one end, and make the connection.  However, the nuts on the Trendnet adapter are riveted into the body, and are thus not removable.  I had to revert to using a pair of gender changers so as to get clearance to be able to connect the adapter to the device that I needed to connect to, making for a messy configuration.It works, but really needs to be rethought.  You may well be able to find an adapter that will work better for your needs if clearance is critical.ADDING TO ABOVEI've now had a chance to use this adapter for some time, and have just come across a problem that appears to be repeatable.  One of the reasons I needed to use this device was to connect to Cisco switches, which have a serial console port.  I have now had two separate bluescreens on Windows 7-64 while connected to a Cisco.  This is repeatable, and consistent.  However, when connecting to other devices, the adapter worked fine.  For comparison, the Cisco connected fine with an older USB-Serial adapter that I found in the office.  I will continue to test, but for now, I had to take a star off for the BSODs."
2220,0,"I've owned this radio for approximately three years now.  Its primary purpose for me is to allow me to listen to radio in an emergency situation, when I don't have power.  I played with it a few times over the last three years, and put it away for an emergency.  Fortunately, I never had one.  I moved about a year ago, and played with it again when I was unpacking, and all was well. When I heard others talking about emergency radios recently, I pulled it out of its drawer again, and found out that some time in the last 10 months, its dynamo system quit working. It will power the light while I'm cranking, but not the radio (or maybe I just can't crank hard enough to get any volume).  And neither the light nor the radio will work off of the rechargeable battery.  May be an easy fix, I don't know. I haven't taken it apart yet, but for anything billed for ""emergency"" use, I shouldn't have to."
2221,0,D-Link customer support says this hub cannot support external hard drives with capacities over 500 GB.  Makes this hub worthless in a time when you have to try really hard to find a drive with less than 1TB capacity.
2222,1,"I love this system when it works.  Unfortunately, I have had two failures of the control pod which includes the volume knob, creating heavy static and interference with the left speaker.  So, adios. I have just ordered a Bose system that my wife has had for 5 years that has had no issues."
2223,0,"I recently bought a Panasonic Lumix FX01 after a long camera search.  I planned to keep it in my pocket most of the time, so I thought that I'd better guard the screen by getting some of these protectors.  They would have been relatively easy to cut and put on except they aren't premeasured to fit 2.5"" screens.  That's a bummer--every camera I looked at had  a screen at least this big.  So I had to measure it myself.  (Also, I had to waste the rest of the sheet, which should have had enough room left to make 3 more covers.)  Once I put it on the camera I was kind of disappointed.  The Lumix has a beautiful display, but with a plastic protector stuck on it it just looked a lot less amazing.  It wasn't harder to see or anything, just less appealing.Anyway, after a few weeks of use I had to remove the protector.  The corner started peeling up and of course couldn't be stuck down again.  I'm not willing to hand measure and cut one of these things every month, so I guess I won't be using them anymore."
2224,0,"The bag looks good so there's no problem there. The problem is that it's too small. Somehow when viewing the picture, I thought it was larger. In fact the description even says 'large"". Dont be fooled.It couldn't hold my Canon T3 and one lens. The fit was too tight and I had trouble getting them out of the bag.  About the only thing I would put into that bag is a small  point and shoot camera and even then  it would be difficult to add  anything else.This is a very small bag. If you need something to carry your camera and lens in, this is not it."
2225,2,"I love these headphones and have been using them for years.  My kids (8 and 10) discovered them and now won't use any others.  They are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them.  Only downside is that they aren't very durable, but Koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replaced."
2226,1,"I had these connectors in the past, just bought a new recevier and needed some new ones i went ahead and started searching for good banana plugs, i found cheaper ones that sound just as good as these ones.Overall the monsters ones are easy to install and are good quality but you can find cheaper ones of the same qualityGLS Audio Black Chrome Series ""Generation 4"" Gold Connector Banana Plugs Banana Clips - 20 Pack (10 Reds & 10 Blacks)."
2227,0,After considerable research and pricing I have found this product just what I was in need of.  Excellent sound production.
2228,1,"Based on the previous reviews I bought these and am pretty happy with them.  I would warn anyone, however, that while they certainly reduce some ambient noise (you would want to remove them to converse) they are not in the class of ""noise cancelling"".  This became apparent on the plane where it was impossible to hear the full dynamic range of a classical symphony (soft passages are lost) over the roar of the jet engines.  The headphone help, but this is a real limitation.  Otherwise, sound quality and comfort are decent and for the price you'd have a hard time finding better."
2229,0,"Before you order this make sure you have a phone that takes it.  It is my fault, so I can't fault it, but it said it works with portable phones (not cell phones) and when I ordered it I was not at home and when it arrived I found that my phones didn't take a headset at all."
2230,0,"To this day - October 24, 2008 - the D-Link hubs (including this one) will revert all the ports of itself to USB 1.1 when even only a single USB 1.1 device is plugged into it.  So your USB 2 speed is gone.It will not allow itself to be daisy-chained to an exact same model with any stability.The customer ""service"" department at D-Link is beneath contempt.Save your money and your aggravation."
2231,1,"Of the four hand held receivers I've used, the SporTrak Map was the first one that I used extensively and I was very pleased with it for over a year, until it quit working for no apparent reason.  I sent an email message to Magellan support explaining the problem and received a reply saying that `it sounds like you'll need to send in the unit for repair.'  No address or instructions were given as to where or how I was to send it.  I sent two additional email messages requesting further instructions, but I never received a reply.  I then phoned Support twice and was put on hold for such a long time that I gave up.  Other than an inelegantly designed external cable connector and terrible customer support, the SporTrak Map would have been a very good receiver for the price.  Oh, except that it failed to function after about a year."
2232,2,"I purchased this to use with my Canon Powershot SX50 HS, so I could remotely trigger the shutter on long zoom shots while having the camera mounted on a tripod. I wanted this in order to prevent any camera shake (and the resulting blurry image), without having to resort to using a timer on the camera itself. The remote does exactly what you would expect, it triggers the shutter on the camera, and since it doesn't require batteries, is always ready to be put to work without any fuss. It works really well and overall, am very happy I purchased it.The cable is very short, which isn't much of an issue when you're standing right at the camera, but if you want to move away from the camera at all, then the short cable becomes more of a liability. This is easily (and cheaply) remedied by purchasing a 2.5mm headphone extension cable. I went with theYour Cable Store 12 Foot 2.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension Cable(available here on Amazon for under $7 at the time of this writing), which now gives me a combined cable length of 14 feet. That said, the short length of the cable is the primary reason for me knocking off a star. Other than the short cable, this is a good, quality remote shutter switch for supported Canon cameras, including the Powershot SX50 HS, and I have no problem recommending it to anyone who has a supported camera (though I would recommend picking up an extension cable at the same time, just to make your life easier.)"
2233,2,Works real nice no trouble with the set screw to hold the antenna in place also has instructions on setting it
2234,2,"Howdi,  I got it couple of months ago and I must admit that it's great in terms of image resolution and quality. The like taking this camera to any concerts or shows and you have all the images on floppy..share it with people or publish on the net..just great. and on top it supports image stabilization just like my other Sony TRV87 and i can exchange batteries between them.The only thing which I don't like that much are the big size of this..due to 3-1/2 inch floppy and MPEG movie.. which is not very good in quality if you are moving the camera very fast and I don't even make many mpeg's out of this. Otherwise, it's so much fun using this and since I'm into photography, it let's me publish some photos online, quickly."
2235,1,"I replaced my ailing LogiTech 2.1 sound system with this one. Price wasn't a big consideration, although it cost less than my LogiTechs. Reviews were decent and it's a brand name after all. These will play nicely at high voiumes if you're into that sort of thing. The satellite speakers are crisp. Bass is tight, but weak. I have the bass knob cranked all the way up and overall I like the sound.I would compare these to comparable LogiTechs and M-Audio"
2236,0,These are very cheaply made and the sound quality is horrific. I'd only buy these if you are really desperate for music while you are running and you need a cheap headphone... I'd suggest getting a better quality one that will last longer.
2237,2,"I was little skeptical about buying this one. Portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look. My doubts continued as I was unpacking my Portapros. Could this little, flimsy, plastic set of headphones be that good? All of my doubts have evaporated once I have tried using them. These headphones have two big pros:1. Sound quality: One thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_. I have compared them to my Sennheiser HD201 and Sony MDR-A34. There is no comparison. Portapro is much louder. Of course, if you don't like it, you can turn down the volume. However, despite the loudness, the sound is excellent. I can pick a lot of details in my music CDs that were nearly undetected with the MDR-A34 and barely audible with the HD201. When I play first person shooter games, I am getting excellent directional sound.2. Comfort: The comfort is excellent. The headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don't apply much pressure to my ears. I can wear my Portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort. The reason for this, is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears. You can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears. If the default is too much, you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the ""Comfort Zone""  settings (the blue buttons above the driver, it's best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones). Since the headphones sit tight on your head, they're suitable for outdoor or gym use. The cable length is just right to reach your PC speaker or mp3 player (about 3 feet), but I suppose that some people will find it too short. Finally, the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability.And, have I mentioned lifetime warranty? If they ever break, just send them to Koss with a $6 check. They'll fix or replace them for you. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap, reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor use."
2238,2,"The cable feels cheap and it is a thinner cable, but so far I've had no issues. The volume control is good, there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume. I'm rather picky with audio and I haven't had any issues, there is no interference or sound distortion that I can tell. I highly recommend it."
2239,0,"I bought this item hoping that it would work in the PC Card slot in my Civic, but when I popped it in and pressed the Card tab, it would not read from the device.  I checked the card reader and media both in a laptop prior to using it in my car, so I knew that the media and adapter both work.  I believe that Honda uses a Type I card slot instead of a Type II card (this adapter is Type II).So, if you are thinking of getting this for your car, you'd be better served getting theSanDisk SDAD-38-A10 CF to PC Card Adapter, which is specifically mentioned in comments as working w/Honda.  Now I am just hoping that the new card that I bought will be able to address a 16GB CF card!"

Just one problem, and its a big one.  Sometimes it just stops working. Sometimes re-establishing the connection through the control panel will work, sometimes not.  Sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work, sometimes not.  Sometimes absolutely nothing can be done to get it to work, but then the next day it will be working fine.If the mouse spirits are kind to you, you'll love this mouse.  If not, you'll curse it"

2249,0,"Update:  After my device died (10 months) I tried to get an RMA to return it.  D-link insists that I ship it back to them including all the stuff that came in the box like the Quick Installation guide.  If I leave out that box litter (which I no longer even have) they will charge me $35 which is more than I paid for this device.  Additionally return shipping is at my cost.D-LINK WARRANTEE is WORTHLESS.What they don't tell you is that you cannot use the main selling point--fast charge high current mode-- with an apple computer.  Same with Linux.  it only supports windows computers for that mode,  On windows computers you have to install a driver that looks for ipads and only then activates high power mode.  Thus effectively it is worthless except for ipads (not iphones) on widows computers.  The only way you can use the high power mode is to detach it from the computer so that it's not a USB hub anymore, then the hogh power mode turns on.  That is it's just an expensive wall charger not a USB hub,  All this is documented in the instructions that come with it, but not in the marketing literature.  They get 1 star for being deceptive.Update:  there is now fine print at the bottom of the ad that says you have to turn off the computer to use fast charging mode.  why is this big deal shoved into the fine print???Update: after 10 months it died.  Now I find it's impossible to contact tech support at D-link.  Their so-called Chat is just troubleshooting database not an actual human.  I've sent three e-mails in the month and all I get back are automated responses.  No RMA number or instructions on how to get it replaced.  The links for ""phone"" don't work.However I did find a number to call them at gethuman.com  800-326-1688to be able to get tech support do not choose the phone menu option for tech support as this will just give you another phone number to call that won't list this model on it's endless phone menu.  Instead you have to select the customer service path on the phone tree.  then they will say you need to talk to tech support first to get an RMA number.  they can transfer you to the right tech support phone queue.  after an hour on hold you may get an RMA number after they fruitlessly diagnose your dead box.  you can then call back to customer service to return it.or you can just not buy D-link products.

Its easy to forget that you're wearing these because they're comfortable and adjust well. They don't squeeze on the ears and head like a lot of headphones do but they stay put comfortably. I also like the way the headphones fold into such a small size, they fit in a coat pocket or computer case pocket. While they look like they might be a little frail, they seem to be pretty rugged. I have a few different sets of headphones and these became my instant favorite."

2255,1,"I was a firm believer in writing things down on paper - My dayrunner was always with me and worked well for me for many years... I took the step a few  years ago to a PDA, my husband bought it for me for xmas, and it was amazing how much i learned to rely on it and use it!Excellent way to keep track of addresses, phone numbers, and organize your busy schedule (both professional and personal).Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks to this unit that I would like to share with you, and when i get a new one (I think this xmas i'll be upgrading!) I will know what is important to me in a PDA --No backlight, this is annoying when you can not see your screen in a car or somewhere else, a backlight would be great.Not compatible with my MAC - i have a PC at home, but at  work we are on MACs, and i can not synchronize my schedule electronically at work, nor can I hotsync at work.When your battery runs out, all of your information is lost, forever! This was a shocker! I had hotsynched a few months ago, so i was able to reload my old, out of date information back to my clie, but it was pretty awful, since all of the new appointments were not in the PDA, nor were updated phone numbers and addresses.The buttons get pressed when it is in my purse, since the stick up slightly, they get pressed when in my purse, and then it runs the battery down.It locks up - i would say it will freeze up and lock up about once every 2 months. that is frustrating and has no apparent reason for doing this.I try to charge the battery every few days, so that helps with the memory loss.I have found I really do enjoy having all of my information at my fingertips at all times, and this helps me manage my many meetings and events at work and home - and now that i know i will actually use and enjoy this device, it is time to upgrade to color, backlit display and MAC compatible software! I'm looking at the Zire 71 (it has a digital camera!)."
2256,2,good remote.  Can be finnicky at times if not lined up correctly with the camera.
2257,0,"I recently installed an entire wireless network using Linksys 54g products.The installation took place in one room.  The router was to sit in the room with the desktop, but I also installed the laptop in that room because it was easier than walking around.The first issue was that a neighbor had the same system (or 802.11b) and failed to secure he network so I accidentially picked his up and was a little confused until I realized what happened.Now the desktop has XP, the laptop has Win2k.Either the linksys desktop software (Which is different from the laptop software. Why????) or the PCI card itself had problems because the wireless connection would drop all the time, and to reconnect you needed to go through this whole process (about 3 clicks every 5 minutes as it dropped).  It would not reconnect automatically even when I set the network as the default network to connect to, and it would repeatedly pick up the neighbors network even though I kept deleting it (you'd think it'd be able to detect the same MAC address and once I reject it once, it never brings it up again...).During this time the laptop's PCMIA card worked fine.We ended up hard wiring the desktop to the router, because they were in the same room anyways (the laptop of course would be used to wander the house).Can I recommend this card then?  No.  It didn't work. Do I recommend the PCMIA card and the router?  Yes.Additionally the laptop software was much more intuitive than the desktop stuff."

2263,0,"This hub is having a lot of problem handling a combination of devices such as iPod and external hard drives while they are all connected.I often need to connect two or three external hard drives to this hub to consolidate the files into a 320GB external drive.  The hub does not provide enough power to have more that 3 of its 7 ports connected, and when used with external drives, you will see that at least one of the external drives (depending on how many drives are connected) would continuously connect and disconnect until the number of USB ports used is decreased by disconnecting some devices.I bought 2 and both behave identically, so if you want to use several external hard drive and perhaps hook up your iPod at the same time, you should look else where, this hub will disappoint you."
2264,2,Does everything it was meant to do. Only reason for the 4* is the (relatively) steep price
2265,2,"CD Changers are getting very hard to find at a good price. I really like this JVC changer. It replaces a three or four year old fairly high end Sony changer that started skipping the first 10 seconds of every disc. The changer is connected to a Yamaha RXV-2600 receiver via a fiber optic connector (the same path as the Sony changer). I was very surprised at how much better CD's sound on this player. I'm totaly sold. My guess, you can spend a lot more money, and not be any happier.One downside to this changer, it is tall. But I'll take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap sounding."
2266,2,"I adore these headphones! I'm really hard on them and use the things almost daily. They get shoved into my bag, ripped out, tossed around, and stuff like that. Other than the time I stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it (but superglue fixed everything!) they're just the same as when I got them last year. I tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didn't have any success. Bass and sound quality is superb. Whenever mine break I'm getting another pair!"
2267,1,Because they are Bose wall mounts they do work.  Getting the wires thr the walls is a pain.  Also think they are way too expensive for what they are.
2268,0,Complete junk.  You have to hold the remote about 2 inches away for it to work.  Don't waste your time on this.
2269,0,"It was a nice camera until it stopped working in the first week of my three week Paris, France trip. It was working fine, I took couple of pictures and turned it off and then it never turned back on. Also from other reviews you will see the same engineering mistake. There is a small screw coming out and shorting the circuits and power. I called Fuji, they told me to send it to a repair center, and the cost of repair is same as the camera itself now, I won't get it fixed or buy any other Fuji product again. This is a common problem that they had with their design in this particular model and they should fix it with no cost at me. If a car has such a common problem, they recall it and fix the problem for you with no cost but for cameras you pay 400 dollars (it is some money, maybe not same as cars but why do we measure respect with money) and they don't respect their customers, then ok, they won't have loyal customers either. NEVER TRUST FUJI, go buy a better camera from sony or canon."
2270,2,Looking forward to using this on vacation. The tripod is very sturdy and is great for the price.I love how it compacts down to a foot - fits in a suitcase great. Supports my 5D2 with 24-70L quite well.To make it better:Allow alternative heads - a ballhead would be much better for photo work.Use better clamps. The leg clamps are the cheapest part on it - and I would have liked to see better plastic used. The legs are strong and metal - would have liked that level to been consistent throughout the rest of the design.
2271,0,"These are some pretty average-sounding headphones. The cool thing that I liked about them was the volume control on the cable. However, it was entirely uncool when the volume control shorted out. We didn't mistreat these things. We use them while walking on a treadmill and there's never any stress put on the cable. Through typical use of the volume control it has proven that it wasn't well-made. Listen, when you have to twist and squeeze the volume control several different ways just to get sound to come back on in both ears = FAIL."
2272,0,I'm lucky if I can get it to download 50 meg without locking up.  Only supporte 128 meg cards - NOT 256.  Will NOT support Secure digital cards.  Built like a plastic toy.Not happy.  Am returning this piece of junk.
2273,2,"I have an older Brother machine which specifies the TZ tapes. When I received my order, it was the newer TZe tapes, and I was concerned they would not fit. But alas, they are fine. However, if you have a newer machine, I understand the older TZ tapes will not work because the newer machines have an extra post in the tape area. Not sure about that since I don't have a newer machine. But I will tell you the new TZe tapes work fine in the older models. I use the White on Black tape to name the various buttons on TV's, receivers, etc. that are too small to read otherwise."
2274,2,"I usually use ear buds, or speakers, but I thought I would try these. The bass and the sound response in general are quite good. They are seemingly flimsy, or should I say, light weight, but I have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece. I would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds, so long as the style appeals to you."
2275,1,"I bought this product confidently expecting clear audio without any feedback, but that unfortunately is not the case when you want to listen to your music on louder levels. The background fuzz/feedback noise IS noticeable and it bugs the crap out of me.Granted, it is less noticeable after adjusting volume levels on either your car stereo or your iPod so don't tell me to do that...but you can't get around it when you want to listen to your music beyond a certain threshold of volume which I find restricting. You have to constantly juggle with the volume of either the stereo or your iPod to reach that perfect balance and I find that highly inconvenient.Other than that, it does it's job but it looks like a pretty cheap product that I wouldn't want to pay more than $10. I am less than satisfied with this purchase."
2276,2,"Opened the box and was impressed. I have no experience with professional tripods, however, this tripod is built well if you are careful. People must really smash their equipment around to complain about this tripod being cheap. WEll built, However the fluid head has double adjustment. There are two screws that increase the pressure of the fluid making the tripod drift back during pans. These need to be loosened a bit if the tripod is drifting back too much. The other adjustments lock the tripod in place, Firm feeling and acceptable. Retractable spikes on the feet for outdoors. Built in level. Fantastic tripod if you are used to cheap-o Walmart tripods."
2277,2,"My wife watches a lot more TV, often using headphones so that I can avoid the incessant prattle of TV. This allows her to control her earphones that are powered by the TV audio output.  (The audio output is always on, but doesn't have a volume control.)"
2278,2,"Installed in no time flat. Great sound output, simple to use and looks good in my black interior Jeep. I would give it five star but it doesn't have weather channels. Still a great product at a great price"
2279,1,"While this gives me 2014 connecting in a 2003 car with a tape deck, it has a little feedback and the letter s in my music is a little heavy and nail scratchy. My last 2 dollar unit had no problem with the letter s, but it had a problem with working without static, so this sony wins."
2280,1,"I'm not as satisfied as a lot of the other reviewers are with the sound quality of these headphones. Yes, they're extremely comfortable and soft, and I appreciate the included 1/4-inch adapter, but there's tighter bass and brighter mid-range coming through my little pair of Skull Candy for the same price! I also had to increase the volume about 20% to get the same loudness."
2281,0,"they do slip from the ear, but they are pretty durable"
2282,0,"I bought one of these for my brother and was pleased with it at first.  Setup was surprisingly easy and we had wireless access throughout the house for his Windows machines.So when I wanted wireless access in my apartment I bought one for myself.  I tried skipping the installation CD since I have a MacBook and figured the default setup should be fine.  Unfortunately I could not get an Internet connection working.  When I tried accessing the router's configuration through my Web browser, it was in Italian!  Apparently the router autodetects your language and if you have a Mac it thinks that you speak Italian.  With no way to fix the configuration, I returned the Linksys and got a Netgear WGR614 which worked fine and is better looking.When I visited my brother again with my new MacBook I couldn't get on his network.  After much tinkering and research I found that a bug in the Linksys router software prevents Macs (and presumably Linux or Wii) from getting IP addresses.  I was able to fix it by installing an outdated version of the software, but that kind of problem is unacceptable.  Do not buy this router if you'll be using anything other than Windows."
2283,0,"From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal ""automatic"" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.So I called back again. And again. And again.Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person.Install from CD. Reboot. etc.It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort.I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card!I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650.Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news.I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless.Back it goes."
2284,0,"Because of the negetave coments on this item regarding feedback noise, and even though my primary use is for CD/MP3 books and not music, I didn't buy it. Instead I purchased the one from Radio Shack, part number 273-353 that was suggested by one of the reviewers. There is no feedback noise associated with this power adapter, in either music or CD mode."
2285,0,"The sound of these headphones has too little treble and too much bass.  You feel like you are seated in the bass section of the orchestra and can hardly hear anything but the basses.  I much prefer my Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP earbuds, which have plenty of bass, but it is not overpowering."
2286,2,"The more I use my Powershot G10 on tripods or try to do long exposures, the more I realize that when my finger presses down on the shutter, it slightly vibrates the camera and I get a slightly blurry exposure. Well, after untold numbers of photos and me scratching my head like an idiot, I decided to get a remote switch.The remote switch works fine as advertised for the Powershot G10 and works on the Rebel series digital SLRs as well (XT, XTi, etc). And this being a Canon accessory, you'd better believe you pay more than you should for the Canon brand. The cord isn't that long, but can easily be extended with a trip to Radio Shack and for $10 (Google ""rs60-e3 extension"".)"
2287,0,"Still a beta box, If you get much beyond a basic configuration, this box is not for you. Running the latest firmware (1.2) the box crashed several times and had to be initialized. Netgear's technical support states that this box cannot be used a just a VPN server, it must also be used as the network gateway in order for the VPN's to work. Entirely not acceptable."
2288,0,"Logitech Keyboard IssueOn 22-Nov-2004 I called Logitech at 1-702-269-3457 to arrange for an RMA.  They said no need to send the broken unit back, they would send a replacement keyboard out within 24-48 hours.  They assigned Case #XXXXXX and RMA# XXXXXX.On 29-Nov-2004 spoke to a nice person(name witheld) who was pleasant and polite.  I told her that the good news was that I just received the replacement keyboard, the bad news is that it is the wrong one.  It is a ""Media"" model which is a lower model than the ""Elite"" that I purchased.  I pointed out that this model is missing 2 key features, the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top; the 2 main reasons for which I bought the Elite model.She put me on hold and when she came back, she proceeded to try to convince me that the model they sent me was an ""upgrade"" from the ""Elite"".  I explained to her that her assertion was incorrect and the ""Media"" model was clearly an inferior model.  I pointed out that on Newegg.com, the ""Media"" sells for $18 while the ""Elite"" sells for $29.  I again pointed out that this model is missing 2 key features, the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top; the 2 main reasons for which I bought the Elite model.She put me on hold several times during the call which, by the way, lasted for 55 minutes.  Each time she came back she continued to try to sell the idea that I was getting an upgrade.  I was patient for the first 50 minutes of this but I'm not a saint and finally stopped her.  I told her that I was an Engineer, a very technical and computer savvy person and that no one, any where would consider what they did an upgrade.  I told her that I didn't appreciate being treated this way. And requested to speak to a supervisor.At that point, she admitted that the ""Media"" model was missing features and that she understood my concerns.  She then said that they had no more ""Elite"" models and that's why they sent the ""Media"" model.  I suggested they get one from one of their vendors like Newegg.com; she said I WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT FROM THEM DIRECTLY and they had no way of compensating me for that.  She then said that the ""Elites"" were no longer being manufactured.  What should I believe here????So in the end, they did not comply with the terms of their own warranty.  When I pointed that out, she said that they did by sending me the inferior keyboard.How ridiculous is this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was appalled!  If it didn't happed to me, I would have doubted  that it really happened.  Finally, I asked if she was going to comply with my earlier request to speak to a supervisor.  She said yes and went on hold yet again...she came back and we waited for another 5 or so minutes for the supervisor (Todd) who never answered.  She then asked if she could have him call me back in a few minutes and confirmed my phone number.What nonsense!  I have never seen a company tell such bold falsehoods to avoid fulfilling its warranty commitments, especially considering that this was all for a lousy $30 product.  Wouldn't it have been easier to just make the customer happy and handle this?  They won the battle, but I'll win the war by never buying another Logitech product again and I urge all of you who read this sad tale to also avoid buying from them.The supervisor NEVER CALLED.  Run, don't walk away from these guys."
2289,2,"very good headphones, especially for the cost. The sound is not really accurate, its more muddled in the mids and lows. But for some reason, this just makes them sound awesome, like some vintage amp playing an old school record. I definitely recommend these."
2290,0,"First it seemed to work fine, and I have been using it professionally with two Compaq systems (win2k3 and winxp pro).  Then occasionally after a month of usage, I was not able to get control, forcing me to unplug the KVM, and plug in the keyboard/mouse to gain control of the computer.  I tried it with an older Dell box (Pentium III era, and I couldn't get it to function at all.Now, this loss of functionality seems to be the norm.  I tried using this on two shuttles (winxp 64-bit ed. and win2k3) at home, and I cannot wake up the computers after they go into sleep mode.  I tried the IO Gear KVM solution, and I do not have the same problem.Essentially, I left with not only an ugly looking two-port KVM, but a dysfunctional KVM.  Given this and other horror stories with other KVMs, I am really disappointed with Belkin, a company that I thought made quality products.  I guess this is no longer the case..."
2291,0,"I was dissapointed with this product.  I own a D100 and had hoped to use this cable with the camera.  This cable does not fit into the shutter release on the camera.  It only fits on the optional battery pack you can get for the camera.  If you don't have the optional battery pack, this product is worthless.  So if you do not have the battery pack I would not purchase this product."
2292,1,"With respect to the positive aspects, the main one is that the bracket has two hot shoes at its end at such an angle that it can comfortably hold two items, particularly a light and external mic. Also, it is quite adjustable in terms of distance it can be set from angle and angle. The product is also well built. It is made of plastic but very durable and hard plastic so it is very difficult to break. Despite all these attributes why does it only deserve 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Primarily because the tripod mounting stud is too small!! It barely fits, due to its diminutive size, into the tripod socket. Due to its small size, if you had it in the socket for a prolonged period of time and it was holding any item of more than the smallest of weights, it would probably damage the tripod socket. This is particularly the case if your camera's socket was plastic as opposed to metal. How much would it have cost Sima to have used a slightly larger stud? Another penny or two? What a shame to degrade such a product for that."
2293,2,I JUST NEEDED AN IMPROVEMENT FOR HOME LISTENING WHILE ON MY COMPUTER. THESE ARE BETTER THAN MY OLD ONES AND AVOIDS ALL THE POPPING SOUND.
2294,0,"After one month of use, it now randomly beeps and randomly kicks the power off (you can hear the relay inside the unit going up and down).  Doesn't matter if anything is plugged in or not.Another notable: the on-off switch on the unit does NOT turn off the 3 outlets that are surge protected.  Most computer equipment now are vampires (draw power even when turned off).  I personally prefer to cut the power to my computer equipment when not in use.I have had better luck with other APC products.Update Aug. 2004: The unit magically got better.  Now it only does the random shutdowns once a month or so.  I would raise the rating a notch or two if it allowed me to."
2295,0,"I do some basic network consulting on the side, and have seen three WRT54G routers fail so far.  One was mine, two were customers'.  Of the ten or so that I've worked with, thats around a 30% failure rate.  Not so good.  When they work, they're great.  The failures generally came after power outages, so it's likely to do with the power supply and/or conditioning in the power circuit in the router.  In any event, I have not seen this failure rate in the D-Link, Netgear or Buffalo routers that I have worked with."
2296,0,"This headset sounds good but breaks very easily.  Some other Panasonic models share this ""feature"".  Mine worked well for a couple of weeks and then the mic went out (I can hear people b ut they can't hear me).  Other people have explained that if you rotate the microphone it puts stress on the wires inside and can cause them to break.  Four stars for sound quality, one star for durability.Bottom line -- it sounds good for the money but don't swivel the mic!"
2297,1,"I got these for my friend last Christmas and they served him very well for a while. He found them comfortable and the sound quality to be very good. I tried them briefly and felt the same way. But less than a year later, they died on him. Can't easily recommend these unreliable headphones. If you want to take the gamble, they look and sound great for the price but they just might give out on you. This year, I got him a pair of Koss headphones to replace them because of their lifetime warranty. And, no, I have no idea if my friend called customer service."
2298,1,"Tried these out at FYE. They're comfortable and have clear sound but lack bass. Not the best for rap, dubstep, etc."
2299,0,"As many have said, this product is not your standard plug 'n' play and Linksys support sucks. You would think they could answer a simple question like ""Is this print server compatible with an Epson CX5200?"", but obviously not. I spent many hours and much frustration trying to get this to work but to no avail. I guess the krux of the matter is, don't try using a print server on a combo printer. I'm returning mine and I guess I'll stick to a standard printer connection.In fairness to Linksys, I will say that all other Linksys products I've bought have been easy to configure and worked great."
2300,0,"This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased, and I have learned a lot since then.1) Avoid cameras where the lens extends outward from the body! These are prone to many problems, ranging from impact to debris effecting its performance.2) Make sure the camera suits your purpose, test it in the store if you can. If you want a camera to capture action, this IS NOT the camera for you.For simple snap shots, this is not a bad camera, for action it is virtually useless.I now have a Nikon D50, which is infinitely superior, and worth the extra $$$."

2302,2,"If you're like me & you've just spent $$ on a nice SLR/D-SLR camera; you want a nice protective bag for your kit, but don't have a lot of spare $$ to spend on it.  This bag is well designed, seems well made, and is low priced.  It has storage space for your camera & 2 lenses, as well as some additional compartments that are perfect for spare batteries, SD Cards, external flash, filters, and an external flash.  I think it's a great value for the money, even if you end up getting several lenses down the road & need to replace it with a bigger bag.  If you don't see yourself having more than what's already been mentioned then this bag will fit the bill for you long-term as well."
2303,0,my 604 arrived without the plastic spacer required to hold the cat 5 cable in the connector. after a few dropped connections i realized the unit was defective.
2304,1,"The HD-280 headphones by Sennheiser were the first pair of headphones I ever purchased that were considered ""good"".  After putting them on and trying them out on a few of my favorite sources (computer games, home stereo, etc), I was pretty impressed.  Sennheiser clearly knows how to make a good pair of phones that sound good.As is obvious from the pictures, these are closed headphones, designed to surround your ears, block out ambient noise, and allow you to really listen to the music...not just ""hear"" it.  I was most impressed by the highs and mids, but found the phones lacking somewhat in bass.The lightweight plastic construction raises some questions.  It seems as though Sennheiser decided to make a lightweight pair of headphones for home use.  However, I found the construction quality lacking, and eventually the headphones broke from normal wear and tear.  Also, the phones started to only reproduce sound in one ear, regardless of the source.  I did not investigate further, but I suspect the cord may have been shot.All in all, these are decent headphones for home use, but I would not recommend them for music on the go.  Their questionable durability (mine lasted less than two years) leads me to believe that you should keep these at home in a safe place.  If you do so, you should be able to enjoy some decent sound."
2305,2,"I now own three pair of these,  They are a bargain, as I have dozens of earbuds (mostly in ear) and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound.  The only pair I ever &#34;broke&#34;  was a pair that I sent through the wash TWICE!  You will spend at least 2-3 times their price to beat them.  One audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better (at $299.00)  Again, best value given their  price and performance."
2306,0,"The industrial design on this product is great!  Compact design, and a slick folding antenna.The driver/software support is horrible.  It took me 2 days to get it working with a Sony VAIO.  The software install disk failed and I had to manually install the drivers and the documentation provided was poor and didn't cover all the properties settings for the drivers.The worst problem is that Linksys claims this product is &quot;hot swappable&quot; which is a half-truth.  You can plug it in and it will activate, but if you unplug it, then plug it in again, it will not reactivate.  If you check the Linksys support FAQ, they admit &quot;You may require a reboot after unplugging the device&quot;.  Hardly &quot;hot swappable&quot;..."
2307,0,"I have several sets of extension cables for use in the studio, but I wanted a shorter cable for use when performing with my church. They need to be long enough to reach the personal monitor pod, but not so long that I trip over the excess cable. This cable puts me about 4 feet away from the monitor pod, and leaves enough slack to tuck in between the guitar and my prodigious gut. It's well made and has worked flawlessly for me so far.*UPDATE* After 8 weeks of occasional use, (just for church on Sunday mornings), the cable has failed on the right side. Maybe it was a bad one, but you would think it would last longer than that..."
2308,2,"okay, so these shouldn't be in the ""noise cancelling"" section.  HOWEVER, they are the best-sounding portable headphones i've ever owned, period.  simply powerful, deep, clear, intense bass, clear highs, and fantastically accurate midrange.  and unlike many bass-heavy phones, they don't suck the lifeblood out of your poor little iPod.i've been through all sorts of earbuds and cans and found these after experiencing great sound on a previous set of Koss earbuds.  (i've never had any luck with the awkward fit of earbuds, but i can also highly recommend The Plug by Koss if you have no problem with them -- excellent bass and highs.)  anyway, after comparing and contrasting these PortaPros to the other 5 pair i've bought over the years, there is absolutely no contest when it comes to sound reproduction.  sure, they take up a bit more space than earbuds, but they do fold up quite nicely in the provided faux-leather sack.i use them every day for two hours on the subway and they've gone thru the ringer.  no cord problems, no sound problems. the foam rips over the pads after awhile, but with the lifetime warranty, no worries if you have any kind of problems.  $5 in shipping gets you a brand new pair, no questions asked.lastly, yes...okay, they look mighty dorky -- my coworker saw them and told me to get out of the eighties.  but really, it's all about the music, right?  those hipster dorks who shop at American Apparel wish they had this kind of style!"
2309,0,"I have owned and installed this wireless router and have found it unsuitable for noisy and busy cable modem environments.  This device is suitable in calm DSL environments and if you don't use a cable modem in a large city with lots of neighboring cordless phones, 2.4 GHz baby monitors, and other wireless networks.  The router (wired and wireless) just cannot handle the simultaneous use of two computers on a wired network, a couple of laptops in a noisy wireless environment, and the automated hacker attempts coming in from the cable modem.Because this item is no longer easily ""flashed"" to use alternative software I can no longer recommend it.  If you need a router I highly recommend you investigate the Belkin Wireless-G router series which work perfectly in all the above mentioned environments and have more features than this very expensive Linksys unit."
2310,1,"Tried this lens, but it was soft to the point of being out of focus, felt flimsy (very light plastic), and even in the brightest outdoor setting agonizingly slow to focus on my D90.  Often, the AF overfocused and went back to blurry, or refused to focus at all!I expected to like this Nikon lens more than this, and am now looking for a Sigma or Tamron (where I'll get the macro feature as well, and for the same price).One good thing about this lens (if you don't mind a supersoft image) is it is EXTREMELY lightweight, which is very enjoyable."
2311,1,"I used this to hook up DVD player with my old SANYO TV. Cable signal also go through it to TV. Before I use it, the TV signal is clear. After I used it, signal of some, not all, channels became noisy with rolling stripes."
2312,0,"If you know anything about routers, do not buy this one - it will drive you nuts. First, tech support will refuse to give you the simplest of information (the router IP address) without first registering your product online. If you have a complicated network setup, this can be a nightmare having to connect a computer directly to the router to optain a DHCP lease, get the IP address, then put it back into your existing setup.There is no documentation that comes with the router. The CD contains some pathetically dumbed down garbage, but mostly just useless diagrams.The router also utilizes what has to be the stupidest thing I've ever seen - a setup wizard with no option to skip or go directly to advanced setup. This setup wizard will check for an internet connection and fail out if none is detected. In other words, unless you're connected to the internet when setting up the router, you can't even SET UP the damn thing.In my opinion, something as mind-blowingly stupid is that is a severe product defect. It was returned within an hour of purchase."
2313,2,"As a self-employed graphic artist, I bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies. It's a 17&#34; MacBook Pro, so it's not small enough for a hotel safe, and I hate leaving it out when I leave the room because I just don't want to tempt housekeeping in that way. Packing it back up to keep it hidden every time I go out has gotten too tiresome, though, so I finally looked around and purchased this security cable.I'm so glad I did.This was a fine fit for my laptop model &#8212;the slot for it is on the right. I wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg, so that if anyone decided to take the laptop, they'd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves. I'm aware that anyone really determined to take it still could, but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place, it's really not worth it to the casual snatcher, and that's enough for my peace of mind; it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table, ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up."
2314,0,"This is VERY CHEAP cable. Here are my complains about it.Pros- It does what it's supposed to do (with some trouble)Cons- Very cheap- Very heavy and thick- You have to fiddle around with the male end, otherwise you'll get static"
2315,2,"Nothing wrong with the switch and functions, but for my purposes I needed one longer to get away from the wildlife. I knew it was short when I bought it so it met my expectations and I already knew how to extend it with adapters and an additional extension cord so I'm happy with it. Now I can hide ten feet away and snap pictures of birds, etc without leaving my blind or spooking the wildlife by setting up too close."
2316,0,"I bought this for my Canon Rebel XSI after reading mixed reviews. I returned it however because it is way to bulky and the color is really ugly. I decided to buy the Tamrac 5501 Explorer 1 Camera Bag instead which is the SAME SIZE and fits way more stuff inside because of it's design and many, many pockets!"
2317,2,"I love my case.  It holds my 250mm zoom lens along with necessary pocket for extra battery and memory card and any cords that might be necessary.  Of course the DSLR camera with my 18-55mm lens attached fits in as well.  There is a long strap for carrying plus you can attach it to your waistband if you prefer.  I wish it were slightly larger in the eventuality I might get a larger zoom lens.  On the plus side, it fits easily into my Swiss Army backpack when flying.  These days travelers can only take one personal item to keep at their feet and one carry-on for the overhead bin.  If you are like me, you don't ever want to check your IPAD, camera, cell phone, IPOD, GPS and all accompnaying chargers in your checked baggage, so it's nice to know a camera bag like this will easily fit into that single carry-on backpack or other tote bag. No worries about safety then."
2318,0,I had to return it. I was never able to successfully send a fax using the included fax software or Windows 7 64-bit fax tool. The session always failed regardless of the fax recipient. This in spite of the fact that all software successfully installed several times and the system said the device was working properly.
2319,0,"I bought the Velbon 343E when it first came out a couple of years ago.  It was not long before the leg mechanism broke (internally).  I had a very hard time getting the Velbon address to mail it back to for warranty work.  I finally found the address after contacting the VP of Marketing at Velbon and mailed it back.After receiving the repaired unit it worked again for a few weeks and then broke again.  It has been sitting in my drawer since.  I am going to return it one more time.My advice:  It's a great concept, but is of no value if it breaks this easily.  I would avoid this product."
2320,0,"On the back of the package, the UL Clamping Voltage is listed as 500V.  The package says that for ""sensitive electronics,"" you should get a clamping voltage rating of 400V or lower.  So, the package is telling you that this product is NOT a good choice for sensitive electronics."
2321,2,"Nice piece of gear, lots of notes here.  The finder is a little frail for my likes, but I do use it.  It does provide convenience and a different camera prospective when using the finder.  The little zoom/power advance works well and lets you see more detail.  On the same subject it also cuts out a portion of your screen when you view through it.  I would still use it.  The order came in timely and was undamaged.  Thank you."
2322,0,"This thing works okay as a hub/switch, but I can't connect to my ISP through the external modem.  I was deceived by the product description because it guaranteed this device could handle ""analog"" phone service, which is all I have.  Therefore I bought this product under the pretense of false advertising, and I'm stuck with a gadget that doesn't work.  At least I bought it before the price went up $20.  Now I have to have a network guru come in and see if there is any hope of salvaging my investment."

It did not show any signal of signal improvement at all.  Just to be fair, this item was used when I received it.  Not sure this item is broken or just not working.  I returned the item and in the process of getting my refund.  Would not recommend purchase of this item."

2327,1,"UPDATE: The scroll wheel finally gave out and became a loose mess. I couldn't scroll worth a darn. I tried fixxing it by bending the scroll wheel reader in towards the scroll wheel axle, but that didn't do a darn thing. It gave me a little bit of solid scrolling for a little while, but it went right back to its old problem.But that's just me. Others might have a different experience than me and Kensington might have fixed it by now (the mouse color scheme looks different than the one I have, but it's the same one). I eventually got a Logitech MX 700. Lots better.OLD REVIEW: I got this as a replacement for my Kensington Mouse-In-A-Box Optical Pro which started having problems with the buttons not responding. Also, the KMIABOP had inaccurate tracking. It moved pixel by pixel horizontally, but moved by every two pixels vertically. Not good if you're a graphic artist.The good thing about this Optical Elite (which apparently is a redesign of the KMIABOP) is that it fixes all those problems of the KMIABOP, yet it adds one problem which isn't really a problem if you can put up with it. The scroll wheel is clicky when you scroll it from different possitions. What I mean is behind every normal bump of the revolving scroll wheel is a noticable sharp loose click. Like the scroll wheel is loose or something and it's not set in its axle right. I recommend it if this isn't a problem on other Optical Elites. This is definitely designed a lot better than the KMIABOP. It has a neat light up scroll wheel area. It lights up a nice piercing blue (though my light is a little off center). Looks cool at night. Also, the light doesn't turn on and off everytime you move the thing. The buttons are located nice and high too. I used to accidently press the side buttons when I picked up the KMIABOP. And the faux rubber grip is nice too (it doesn't really feel like rubber when you rub your fingernail over the grip). It also has a better name. ;-)"
2328,0,"UPDATE:  I no longer recommend the iPaq 1910 PDA.  While I still like its stylish finish and small size, the slow processor (200Mhz), slow bus (66Mhz), and lack of SDIO (or any other expansion than SD memory) make it a so-so value and a crippled device for the wireless future.  You'll also likely run into endless problems with ActiveSync, as I have lately which already gave me tons of new white hair.  I also have serious problems with HP's customer support and recommend you think twice before subjecting yourself to possible dealing with a customer-hostile company like HP.The updated version of the 19xx series, scheduled for a July release, will use a non-standard processor, still gives you crippled RAM, and is not going to be wi-fi compliant.  So avoid those as well.In its place, consider a Viewsonic V3x series if you want something light and thin -- and V37 supports SDIO -- or a Dell Axim, ugly but packed with features.  If you can afford it, the Toshiba e755 is the perfect PDA, with loads of memory, dual expansion slots, and built-in wi-fi that works.*****Original review:I've had my iPaq H1910 for two months now. Before that I used an Audiovox Maestro (made by Toshiba) and also a Palm m505. I had the Palm only because I got it for free and used it for one specific Palm-only app. I like the Pocket PC environment much better, so I'm not an unbiased bystander in the PPC-vs-Palm platform war.Ok, that's out of the way, let's talk about the 1910. There were two reasons for my purchase. No. 1, the absolutely beautiful screen. Compared to the washed-out screen on my Maestro, the brilliance and richness of color on the 1910 screen is just unbelievable. Even after 2 months, I still admire its quality every day, esp. since I keep a lot of JPEGs and small videos on my iPaq. I keep the backlight level at the midpoint, which is totally adequate under 99% of indoor lighting conditions and also for cloudy outdoor lighting. Outdoors when under the sun, you can go to bright or superbright and the screen is totally readable. The backlight is also flooded evenly unlike on the Dell and Viewsonic products. In short, the 1910 has one hell of a great screen.Reason no. 2 was the compactness. You don't appreciate the smallness and light weight of the 1910 until you see it in real. Go to your local CompUSA, Best Buy or Circuit City for a close look. The metallic body is beautiful, and you won't believe how compact it is, esp. if you are a long-time Pocket PC follower. If I had to compare it to a Palm model, it's the Palm Zire, which of course has a dark, monochrome screen and only 2MB of memory (not all of which is even usable) and absolutely no multimedia features.So I was sold on the two main selling points of the 1910 vis-a-vis other PPC models, which are plenty these days. Of course, with the 1910 you face limitations when it comes to expandability: the SD slot is NOT SDIO capable; there's no ""sleeve"" available; there's no CF slot.If you are a PPC user, you may want to consider the 1910 for its compactness and brilliant screen, esp. if you don't plan to use any IO peripherals. The 1910's speed is quite good (comparable to other 200Mhz PPCs and even to some 300Mhz models.)If you are a Palm user, keep in mind that what you pay for is more than an expensive datebook that happens to run Avantgo and Vindigo. You also get a multimedia jukebox with video, audio and picture support. Besides, on the PPC you are NOT forced to learn a new way of writing. But in the end, you should play with both to see which interface you like better."
2329,0,I purchased this to use with a desktop phone.  In my opinion it has too much feedback when I speak.
2330,2,This bag is excellent quality. However the space is tight if you want to carry multiple lenses. The bag could take my T3i with Kit Lens and there was still some space left for just one more lens. The bag won't carry 3-4 lenses as advertised.
2331,2,"I have had Koss headphones in the past, Pro 4AA and QZ-99.  The Koss Portapro is portable AND has great bass response.  The work great with my Android phone and can be ""rolled up"" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched.  They are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day.  The sound is night and day better than any ear-bud could be and are almost as good as the Pro 4AA.  They are ""open air"" headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types, but it comes close. For $32, you cannot go wrong."
2332,2,"... but great headphones, period, for any application.  These are my favorite headphones - that's not to say they're the most detailed, accurate, or will fool you into thinking they're a set of Stax or anything (they are, of course, astonishingly accurate and detailed).  No other headphones combine this level of comfort, soundstage, openness, and plain excitement into such a compact, durable, and CHEAP package.  These are tiny tiny tiny, but rock out with authority.There's been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the Sennheiser PX100.  I bought a pair of those Senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans, I guess, but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange.  They're also bland and cold.  Beyond sound, they're not even as comfortable as the PortaPros, as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you're walking around.  Finally, the Senns are not only less durable than the PortaPros, but the warranty is only two years vs.  Koss's incredible NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That's right, you never have to buy a set of headphones again, until you die.  Just incredible.  If you want to demo this sound t a lower price, try out the Koss KSC 75 ear clip model, but be warned they're nowhere near as comfortable.  Buy with confidence."
2333,1,"The sound is as good as any pair of headphones, but they keep falling out. I'm not sure if it's becasue being a female my ear holes are small, but they just won't stay put comfortably."
2334,0,"I tried 3 of this lens and all of them had a bit of back focusing issue. If I changed the setting by soldering the board inside it would back focus at close range and front focus at long range. I have a Canon T3i and I don't have a focusing issue with the kit lens. I can try to have Canon fix the focusing issue by sending all of my lenses and camera but after searching google, I found that some people tried to fix the focusing issue by sending the units as many as 3 times but Canon just sent them back doing nothing but cleaning.Rather than be without my camera and paying for the shipping & insurance, I just deal with with the focusing issue by using live view shooting but it's too slow...Unless you have a camera that has micro focusing adjustment, be prepared for back focusing issue when shooting AF. Just google &#34;Canon 50mm back focus&#34;."
2335,2,"I recommend this accessorie for you Palm M100.  It's better than the HotSync Cable since it gives you a place to put your Palm.  But I only give it 4 stars since it should have came instead of the HotSync Cable when you buy the Palm M100.  I really do not understand why you need to buy the Cradle in the Palm M100, when in the other Palms is not an accessorie.  If you have the money and want to have a base station for you Palm M100, then buy it......if not, then I recommend you to stay with the HotSync Cable and save your money for other accessories."
2336,2,"I haven't really had a chance to use the case yet, but it looks like it will do the job."
2337,1,It's not a full 50 feet of speaker wire I can tell you that. After running one side I used about 30 ft and had only 14ft left. Won't buy it again unless they guarantee the right amount on their spools.
2338,0,"No matter what I do with my mp3 player's settings, I cannot get these earphones to sound right.

2339,0,"This device started out well. I even bought a 2nd.However, after only a month, the mounting bracket to the monitor failed.A week later, the 2nd also failed. That one had just been supporting the LCDmonitor and not moved at all. The problem is a very poorly manufactured support which gets ALL the stress.I would only recommend this for a very light, un used LCD, say under 5 pounds.Tried to get a replacement and have yet to get an answer."

Too bad it only lasted 3 weeks before ""frying"" itself.Am waiting now on a replacement from Linksys."

2342,0,"I used this card for one year in the library of my university - and I always had problems obtaining a stable connection. I thought it was because of the signal. Then I used other friend's laptop there - one with a Netgear card, one IBM T41 with built-in wireless, geez, they all worked so well. So, the conclusion is: this D-Link just sucks! I am dumping mine and getting a new one.Don't buy D-Link. Never."
2343,0,"The card installed nicely on my Dell Inspiron, butthe installation hung on my HP Pavilion (severalpeople have described similar experiences).Updated drivers on the website didn't work either.Interesting neither Linksys nor HP have mentionedthis in their support databases.  Given the numberof responses this can't be a fluke."
2344,2,"I was having wrist and elbow pain in my right arm due to working on a computer all the time and using my mouse quite frequently.  A friend of mine suggested a track ball and I decided to buy this one and have been very happy.  My wrist and elbow pain have all but gone away.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because sometimes the ball sticks.  It usually becomes ""unstuck"" very easily, but it is a little annoying."
2345,1,"It works, it is wire. Speaker wire is wire, sound comes out so the wire works. What else is there to say."
2346,2,"I adore these headphones. They are definitely the best portable/lightweight headphones I have used. Amazing frequency response across the entire range. Very comfortable, even if you're wearing glasses. The lifetime warranty is a big plus too."
2347,1,I needed to run some outdoor speakers to 2 decks and didn't want to kill a big spool of high dollar Phoenix Gold 12 gauge for relatively low wattage speakers so I bought 2 spools of this stuff.  Seems a bit thin for 16 gauge but for outdoor service under protected deck areas I figured it would suffice for the application.  Pliable insulation but not much meat inside even for 16 gauge and it is copper clad aluminum.
2348,2,"This is Kodak's entry into the 3 megapixel market (and some reports indicate that this is the first of Kodak's digital cameras to be designed  by Kodak Japan), and considering that Kodak did so well at 2MP with the  DC280, one expects a formidable digital camera, and gets it, for the most  part.  This is my second Kodak digital camera and I've continued to  purchase Kodak because with digital cameras the camera is also the film and  no one knows how to make film quite like Kodak, a la Kodachrome.  The  previous DC280 is a point and shoot camera only, and while the DC4800  offers manual control of many functions, it still basicaslly a point and  shoot camera - for instance, with the DC4800 no control of focus is  possible, and if you want to change shutter speed you have to go through  several levels of menu (no less than 10 button presses to get to the  shutter speed menu and then as much as another 12 to choose the speed).  Hopefully, as the digital era progresses digital cameras will become more  like the SLRs of old with manual control of every function and all the  controls on the body of the camera, rather then buried deep in menus.  (I  understand Olympus is about to release its E10 which is like a digital SLR;  however the price will be about $2000.)That given, lets examine the  Kodak DC4800.The positives -For me, after the 3MP resolution and the  3X lens, what impresses me most about the DC4800 is the high quality, high  contrast, high resolution, high brightness backpanel LCD, which is now  truly useful, unlike that on the DC280.  The backpanel controls have also  been improved somewhat with a 4 axis &quot;joy&quot; button. The camera has  a strap post on each side of the body so one can use a neckstrap; the  wide/telephoto control is a &quot;wiggle&quot; switch under the thumb; and  the viewfinder has a diopter control for those of us needing glasses.  The  DC4800 communicates with the computer through USB only (and unlike the  DC280 can be used at the same time as other USB devices) and acts just like  a flash card reader appearing to the computer as a external, removable  drive, with the fast downloading of a reader.  The front of the DC4800 lens  is well protected, unlike the DC2800.  The manual is typical Kodak well  done, but strangely enough, as with the DC280 manual, the markings in the  viewfinder are not explained.  Exposure after pressing the shutter button  in almost instantaneous and despite the larger file size of a 3MP file,  saving the the file to the CF is considerably faster that the DC280.  Digital zooom is surprisingly good, thanks to the 3MP high density.The  negatives -I was very surprised to find that the lens barrel appears in  the lower right corner of the viewfinder at 28mm; I don't know if this is  not unusual for a point and shoot as I've never owned one before, but I  come close to finding it unacceptable.  The battery situation with the  DC4800 is not much improved so far as I can tell, even though the camera  uses an expensive (proprietary?) Kodak lithium-ion battery; the user will  surely have to invest in a $80 battery and charger kit if extended and  away-from-the-home use in anticipated.  Like the DC280, the battery cover  of the DC4800 can be knocked open by a blow to the bottom of the camera  body - those comtemplating active use should secure the battery cover with  tape.  The DC4800 is supplied with only a 16MB CF card and the buyer can  expect to spend an additional $200+ on a large CF card, which along  with  the $80 extra battery and charger will amount to an additional $300+  investment.  The camera acts only as a CF reader and is not TWAIN  compliant, which leads to lots of inconveniences in saving files.  The  backpanel LCD gets dark in sunlight.  As with the DC280, the tripod mount  is plastic and apparently not intended for serious use.One additional  comment - those buying a digital camera should check back with the  manufacturer for updated firmware - in Kodak's case there were lots of  early complaints about battery life problems with the DC280 which were  largely solved with later firmware."
2349,0,"It looks cool, has a lot of features, comes with lots of accessories, the batteries last a long time -- this seems like it should be a great player, BUT...- The radio won't tune correctly to stations below 91.0 or so - it just keeps receiving the bottom of *its* range no matter what the station is set to- It won't read some audio CD's that I tried, saying ""no disk"".- It won't read a CD of MP3's that I burned, replacing the contents of some directories with random ascii chars.- It seems to chop off the last second of some of the MP3's- On one of the MP3 CD's that I burned, it chopped up about half of the songs into multiple songs, resulting in a blip as it goes from one to another -- i.o.w., it will list a song three times with playing time for each one a third of the total time- Sometimes while playing MP3's, it will randomly jump to the middle of another MP3 in another directory"
2350,1,"This item is great for casual scrolling, forget it if you are a designer or gamer."
2351,0,The design of these should be fine but it's not. They are light weight but often become itchy and uncomfortable.
2352,2,"It does just what it says it'll do: if your PC has a locking slot (almost all do now) and the place where you're working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the airplane-grade cable (schools, libraries, airports, et. al.), all would-be casual thieves will move on. As for more determined thieves, that's perhaps another story. Back up your data!"
2353,0,"This product is overrated. I compared this coax cable with a regular (no brand) type of coax cable on my HDTV and I do NOT notice any difference in picture and sound quality. The construction of the cable is great though.Lastly, the head of the coax cable DOES NOT have the ""THX"" symbol. So this cable could be fake.I will just assume I wasted $10, because returning is such a hassle."
2354,2,"I was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound, but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphones."
2355,1,"I neglected to read the reviews so hopefully this will stop someone else from making the same mistake I did.  Auto-focus is NOT an option with the D40, D40x, and several other common models, something I think the description neglects to mention.That said, it's still a very good lens."
2356,0,"We just moved into our first house, and in the last couple of months, I've purchased three brands of bookshelf speakers. In order, I've purchased a pair of Infinity Primus 150 speakers, a pair of small ($10 each on super sale) Pioneer S-HF21-LR speakers, and now I just opened a pair of Bose 201's I got with my credit card points.The first thing I noticed about the bose 201-V speakers was the build quality: almost as good as the $10 pioneers (the pioneers don't have exposed particle board, the bose speakers do).  There are no post-style connectors, just the cheap hole-and-lever type.  The Infinity 150's are built out of much better materials, have gold post-and screw style contacts, removable fronts, solid wood construction, internal dampening, nice feet, and wall mounting slots.The Bose 201-V's sound decent for their size, but they certainly don't sound as good as the Infinity 150s, which are almost half the price!  Specifically, I notice certain mid-range tones are exaggerated with the bose 201's.  It is almost as if the cabinets have some resonance frequency that sets off with a certain midtone.  The bass response also seems a little uneven, with certain bass drum notes showing up loudly, but other (higher) bass guitar notes almost absent.  The absence of certain bass notes is probably what bothers me the most.  I'm running a straight amp without any EQ.I got these speakers with my credit card points, and I'm thinking of selling them on ebay and buying something else.Check out stereophile for more speaker information.. they had a good article on the Infiniti Primus speakers."
2357,0,Works perfectly - just like my $3 generic audio cables.  Don't pay extra for Monster's marketing.
2358,2,"Very good volume controller and very useful, have it on my PC works with any head phones, does the job it was made for and works great."
2359,2,"For a long time, I wanted to get the flash off the camera; and there are only a few options: Flash cord, STE-2, and Radio transmitters, to name a few; the STE-2 is a great compromise. It works great indoors; it even works outdoors; although, not as good as indoors. It works 90% of the time if you are in a shaded area; about 50% of the time in direct sunlight (depending on distance) I used it to shoot my daughter 50 feet away under some trees and it worked.One point to take away is that you need line of sight; even indoors, if you place the camera in portrait mode (having the camera sideways)make sure that the STE-2 is on the correct side; for example, i was shooting a talent show and I had the flash on a stand on the left side of the stage; I was in the middle of the auditorium, and all worked great; except when I placed the camera in portrait mode with the STE-2 to the right, so my hand and the lens were blocking the line of sight from the STE-2 to the flash.In conclusion, I highly recommend the STE-2 as a great way to start with wireless flash."
2360,2,"I wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs, but then I figured - I'm the jillionth person to review these.  I'm not sure I can add anything, so I'll make this quick:Cool earphones. Work great, cost nothing, totally camouflaged.Not sure?  Buy both kinds.Thank You"
2361,2,"We're dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to (and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system)  This little gem combines a single cd with cassette.  I like the auto repeat function.  The size and price and combo unit had great appeal.  Never used the remote, so don't know.  Easy to ""install"" and use right away - no complex hookup needed.  I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this unit."
2362,2,"I shopped alot before I decided on these headphones i read all the reviews here as well as on many other sites. To tell you the truth I found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the 80's . I rated these babies a 5 star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like  IPOD but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it. I can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the IPOD . I really like these over my VMODA bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc. plus if your walking like I do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you , not a problem with the porta pros on. I have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane, bus, in a car so there are some limitations to it. people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against. In all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds. alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones I tried while looking for a new set.I even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff. I would say you cant go wrong with this headphone set especially for small devices like IPODS and the like."
2363,1,"According to all reviews my wife shouldn't of bought this, although it was a GREAT gesture! Not enough bang for the buck :)"
2364,2,"I have two of these. I bought the first Amp One (the older model with 2 sets of inputs and 2 sets of speaker outputs and the meters on the face) to use with a computer... it was actually a little annoying, functionally, to use for that. I tried it on my home theater to drive my front speakers, I didn't notice a bit difference with my Bose 401s (the older, triangle footprint ones). Those are 4ohm speakers and I never had a problem with it shutting down or overheating, btw. I kept it there because it looked nice on my stack of equipment ;) and eventually picked up a second Amp One (like the one pictured) just to try out in other applications.Anyway, after some time, I replaced my bose (which I never thought were super speakers by any means) with some Paradigm Mini Monitors. With those speakers I could hear a difference between my receiver (Yamaha RX-V630) and the amp one. Not just in loudness, but in clarity. Things just sound more ""alive."" I run the 2nd amp in bridged mode to power 2 Paradigm Titans (wired in serial) as my center channel.I'm sure that these are not the end-all-be-all of amps, but they're better than my Receiver's amps (which was itself noticeably better than previous amps that I'd had). I'm considering getting another Amp One (or two) for the rear or getting a step up in brand (to a Rotel, maybe) and comparing. I've gotten a couple really great deals on Amp Ones. I don't think I'd pay 200 for one and $150 is pushing it, but if you can grab one up for less than $150, it's a sweet deal."
2365,0,"After selling the old one a few years back (along with all my old gear), I knew I had to buy it again. This piece of plastic just came in, and from testing it I can tell it's definitely not as good as the older model! It was redesigned with much cheaper materials, but the product link is the same as the original 50mm 1.8; be warned: all those beautiful photos you see that customers posted--anything from probably 2010 and older--are from the OLD lens.Changes:-all-plastic construction--used to be heavier, most likely metal-slower/noisier autofocus-resulting images are not as crisp, despite same settingsIf you are broke and want a decent lens to toy around with, this will always be a great value, and I will always recommend it for beginners. My complaint, however, lies in the fact that this product was ""updated"" to something of inferior quality and make, without any transparency in the process.Had this been my first time with the lens, I would have given it a 4-star ""great value"" review. Since I once had the pleasure of using the older version of this lens, I notice a clear difference in quality. Moral of the story? Companies will do ANYTHING to make cheaper products without informing the public--hold on to all your old gear, because it'll all be replaced with plastic without your knowledge!"
2366,2,"Nice, high quality, and fits the etrex like a glove!"
2367,2,"Construction isn't that heavy duty, but if you want to reduce the output of electronic, stereo devices to match the input of what you're connecting it to - it works.  Price was right and is convenient for my purposes.  I recommend it - all things considered."
2368,2,"I own 1 each of grado sr 80, sennheiser rs 65 and both the koss sportapros and portapros.  The sound you get with the portapro is as rich to me as the grado sr 80.  Its amazing that such a light headphone can produce the same rich highs and deep lows. Accuracy is no problem for the portapros since there is not much material.Between the portapros and sportapros, I think the portas sound better (The sportapro has developed a light distortion with bass, the reason I recently purchased the portapro).  The sportas metal band does not slip as much as the porta but the porta one-ups again with an adjustable ""comfort zone"" setting for the temporal pads. Design-wise, I like the more masculine look of the portas over the sportas and never used the behind-the-ear configuration of the sportas."
2369,1,"I bought this card to start creating SVCD's (Super Video Discs - basically CD's you can play in your DVD Player) of my favorite show.  I didn't have any problems getting this card to work right out of the box, but when I started watching/recording - I found a lot of strange static on the channel I wanted to record.  After replacing all the cables I was sure it must be the card... as the same cable, plugged into an actuall television had none of this static.  I managed to return the card for a new one, but had the same problem with the second card.I later purchased a Leadtek Winfast 2000xp tuner card - and it has great sound and picture - but lacks the software features of the ATI.  So, for anyone interested in recording and making SVCDs or VCDs of their shows, I offer the following comparison and pro/con list.Picture quality and sound: The Leadtek was far better, showing a crisp picture, and with none of the sound problems of the ATI.Software: ATI is the clear winner here.  Leadtek has no built in channel guide (although you can use titantv.com - but it is much more time consuming than using ATI's built it guide).  The ATI software allows you to create much better recording schedules, and you can modify most details of the recording.  The ATI software created great SVCD compatible MPEG2s (on the non-static channels), but with that static, they were useless.  Leadtek allows you to modify the recording options (like bitrate, etc) in their software - but you can only select the resolution from a drop down list (and the SVCD compativle 480x480 is not there) and  making any custom settings seems to throws the audio/video out of sync by several seconds.One thing to note, however, is that this card comes with an older version of the software.  If you want the new stuff, you'll have to pay $ to get it from the ATI online store.Pros:-Great software-I'm sure some people will have better luck with the whole static issueCons:-Just OK graphics chip-Have to pay for software update-Less than perfect tuner cardEnd result: I started using the freeware Virtualdub to record from the leadtek card, and then convert this to compliant MPEGs.  This works, but it is incredible time consuming compared to the extremely simple ATI setup.  I wish anyone who buys this card more luck than I had!"
2370,0,"I've used this with several T20 Yealink phones and with all of them, callers on the other end cannot hear me.Try something else.  Wish i had."
2371,1,"Despite the attractive pricing, this machine is certainly no bargain. I thought it might serve as an upstairs complement to the Panasonic DVD RV31K I have downstairs. But especially in the light of recent price drops on the latter machine, it's difficult to rationalize purchase of the Apex, even if it's currently in the same price range as inexpensive VCR's. The tray doesn't slide open: it opens with a loud scrape and thunk. The minimal on-site controls (4) practically force you to rely on the remote, which features the largest number of tiny buttons I've ever seen crammed onto a tiny surface area. Unless you have laser eyes and muchkin fingers, it's unlikely you'll be able to punch one button without hitting several others. If you factor in the cost of returning the unit along with the postage you might have saved on another machine, you'll probably realize, as I have, that in this case less is simply less."
2372,2,"I love my battered old Palm III (with no suffixes!). With PocketMirror's latest synch program on my PC, I have no trouble synching with Outlook 2000. To be sure, I'm almost out of memory, but I muddle by. There is only one fly in my Palm ointment - I have never mastered Graffiti. After years of using the Palm III, I'm still barely at 90%+ accuracy. Consequently, I was an early adopter of the Palm keyboard. One of the great moments was a conference I attended at which everybody around me was using lap tops. I zipped out my Palm keyboard, whipped it open, snapped on my Palm and was the envy of everyone in sight. Palm probably owes me hundreds of dollars in finders fees for that one event.The Palm keyboard is really a remarkable device. It folds down to next to nothing - smaller than a paperback novel. It slips easily into a jacket pocket. Yet, it unfolds into a near full-size keyboard with remarkably accurate and 'life-like&quot; action. It is actually easier to type on the Palm keyboard than on my Dell laptop. Taking notes or entering multiple contact data, let alone writing e-mails of any length, is now a breeze.Why did I subtract one star? First, several friends who bought the Palm keyboard have had hardware and/or software problems. One has had to return the keyboard 3 times. I have had NO dififculties, but your mileage may vary. Second, the keyboard cannot be used on your laptop. Unless you have it on a hard surface, it tends to sag in the middle. Third, I had to fiddle with the settings a long time to get the keyboard delay right. Those quibbles aside, however, I highly recommend it to any power Palm user."
2373,0,"I've been ordering this same brand of Memorex CD/DVD sleeves for maybe five years.  I could deal with the decreasing quality every year.  It was always better (thicker paper) than the next major brand or a no-name.This year -- no more.  The plastic window was low quality for all 100 sleeves, loud and wrinkly and distractingly reflective with all the wrinkles.  I'm so dissatisfied I'm going to return these.Another cheaper name-brand I accidentally bought a year before (also beginning with letter ""M"") with slightly thinner paper, at least is uniform and has a clear unwrinkled window."
2374,2,"Overall it does its job.  I had trouble with it sticking to the cinder block walls, I found an alternative."
2375,2,this is great if you feel you don't need to bounce off tricky places. in a small room it will bounce to the target strobes.if you need more range go for pocketwizards.
2376,0,"I've used this camera for 6 years.  Last year I started getting intermittant ""Remove the Cassette"" messages.  I wish I had captured the outstanding three recorded tapes onto my PC then.  Instead I recorded another 45 minutes.  Now, the error message is solid, no matter which tape I use.My experience with Canon in the past has taught me not to waste the time or the money to bother having this repaired.  (I spent about $700 having my previous Canon Camcorder repaired.  It worked a few weeks and died again each time.)Having gone to the web to research this bug, I'm convinced fixing this one will be an expensive and time consuming exercise in futility. (6 weeks plus turn around! and Canon won't tell how much the average repair cost is.  Check the web .. $500+ )Lesson learned.  I'll be shopping a different manufacturer.  Sony?  JVC?  Never again Canon."
2377,0,"To preface...I am not a Bose hater. They make some very good products which I own some of, but they also make some that are not so good and over-priced. This speaker falls into the later category.I ""test drove"" these at a big box store, and I was shocked at how cheap they sounded next to speakers that were much less expensive. And the speakers in similar price ranges just blew these away. These have no base and no high treble. About the only application I can think of for these where they would be acceptable is as dialogue speakers in surround sound systems. And even then, not in my house because I prefer my surround speakers to have better range.Given some of their innovative technological breakthroughs; Bose should be ashamed of themselves for selling such a product and marketing it as a high quality item. Maybe they are rugged and will hold up well, Bose has a reputation for that. But what good is that if the sound is not good?Lots of good reviews, which make me wonder what the people are comparing these to. I would just urge would-be buyers to compare with their own ears before they buy."
2378,2,Surprising good sound for the money. These things sound too good to be used for workouts. They have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat. I use these at work and I couldn't be happier with them.
2379,0,"SEE IMPORTANT NOTE AT BOTTOM (Updated 9/18/03)----------------------------------------------I own an Iomega 128MB Mini Drive (USB 1.1) and wanted something bigger and faster (I have 6 USB 2.0 ports on a new Dell). As soon as I tried the Lexar I could not believe how slow it was in WinXP SP1. The Iomega's performance beat it by a wide margin. Before you shrug me off as a malcontent, hear my tale and look at my benchmark numbers.My introduction to the Lexar was filled with enthusiasm. 200MB in &lt; 50 seconds, the package said! I copied a 43MB directory using Windows Explorer drag and drop. It took 5+ minutes compared to 1 min 30+ seconds on the Iomega USB 1.1. I repeated the timings; little change.I went on to spend 4 hours or so on the internet at Lexar's site (no downloads, no user tips, worthless), Microsoft's site (informative but no help), and hours on Google. After a pathetic Lexar chat session that aborted, I called them and we decided that the Lexar might be defective. Took it back to OfficeMax for a replacement, and the replacement ran just as badly.I diddled with my WinXP system for a couple hours removing some suspect drivers from Iomega and Veritas, changed my CMOS to disable ""USB Emulation"", made sure the Device Manager Policies tab was set to ""Optimize for Performance"", turned off McAfee AntiVirus, and other tweaks. In all, no improvement whatever!Before taking the Lexar back to OfficeMax, I tried two other things: 1) Downloaded the WIN98 drivers and ran the device on my 5 year-old Dell with Win98 and USB 1.1; 2) Found a WinXP system totally unrelated to mine and did a benchmark there.1) My old Dell with the new drivers ran the same 43MB copy in only 1 min.34 secs on the Lexar (big improvement over WinXP and 2.0 ports), but then the Iomega Mini Drive improved as well to 1 min. 10 secs.2) Just now came back from Best Buy who let me use a Compaq Presario with equivalent memory and processor speed (not that this is that important) and with 6 ""Certified"" USB 2.0 ports, running also on WinXP SP1. I copied a 24MB directory from their C: drive in 54 secs. on the Iomega Mini Drive and a whopping 2 mins. 26 secs. on the Lexar JumpDrive. (According to Lexar's packaging this should have taken 6 or so seconds.) And, yes, I did remember to set the Policies to ""Optimize for Performance"".The only conclusions I can draw from all this are: 1) The Lexar 2.0 can't come close to Iomega's 1.1 Mini Drive and their USB 1.1 Zip 250, except on a system with USB 1.1 ports. 2) there might be ""bad blood"" between the Lexar and either WinXP or 2.0 hardware. I lean toward there being a flaw in WinXP SP1. It would be nice if the vendors could supply their own drivers (tested) for Win2000/XP.I'm not trying to disparage Lexar since other 2.0 mini or flash drives could perform as badly. I just tried a SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2.0 and obtained similar poor performance and I saw a newsgroup posting complaining about a Sony Micro Vault 2.0.My advice to you: Buy your drive from a vendor that will provide a quick 100% refund, benchmark the drive you select against a name brand 1.1 version (especially if you have 2.0 USB ports), don't pay a premium for a 2.0 drive if you have 1.1 USB ports. And ... be wary of the hype on the packaging. USB 2.0 means many different things.(ADDENDUM 9/18/03)What I've said above is still true but I've pretty much isolated the problem to WinXP and the buggy way it handles FAT and FAT32. I formatted my PNY Attache 2.0 as ""NTFS"" and the performance took a quantum leap upward. Unfortunately these drives come formatted at FAT or FAT32. So ... if you're having slow performance and don't need portability to non-NTFS computers, this will likely give you an unbelievable boost.Those of you who raved about the performance of this device (with the default FAT format) are probably only copying a single large file. Try copying a directory with 500 small files and you'll likely agree with me. Hopefully Microsoft will fix this problem and I'll pull this negative review."
2380,1,"I'm not sure if this was sincerely designed as a netbook case or whether Targus just rebranded one of their portable DVD player cases. I doubt many people care to use their netbooks (or any laptop for that matter) without having to remove it from the case. Even then, the implementation in this case is absolutely incredulous. If you place your netbook just plainly in the case as shown in the picture, it is 100% unsecured and will fall out if you tip the case in any way- so much for protecting your netbook. To secure your netbook, there is (1) a shallow mesh sleeve that encloses the netbook's wrist rests, and (2) an adjustable horizontal velcro strap. The problem with the mesh sleeve is that using it covers your touchpad, and it still doesn't 100% prevent the netbook from slipping out of the case. Using the horizontal velcro strap will secure your netbook, but then cover a row of keys on your keyboard. How is anyone supposed to use their netbook with the touchpad and keyboard obscured? Minor gripes are that the hard plastic clips on the retention straps that secure the lid will scratch your netbook when the case is closed, and the case doesn't ""stay put"" when you are trying to pack your netbook and the accessory pouch is already full, as the weight of the lid will tilt the case away from you. Again, it's very obvious this case was originally designed for a portable DVD player and not a netbook. Also, the shoulder strap is very cheap and literally a 1"" nylon strap with no shoulder pad or grip. Fortunately, all is not lost. I simply cut out the mesh sleeve and retention straps, and only use the velcro strap to secure the entire netbook when actually traveling. As a result, the lid now opens 180 degrees, making it much easier to pack/unpack all the contents independently, there are no hard plastic parts to scratch my netbook, and I save a few ounces of dead-weight for 'features' that never worked properly in the first place. I also tossed the worthless shoulder strap and either carry the case by the handle for short trips, or slip it into my messenger bag for longer trips. I haven't knocked the ratings too badly because I was able to salvage this bag, but I would not buy this case again.  In my opinion Targus is just looking to make a quick buck by rebranding an existing DVD case that is clearly not suited for its intended purpose. If you're considering this case, look at the CityLine model (actually designed for laptops from the start), or similar cases from Case Logic, Mobile Edge, Kroo, etc that are actually designed for computers and have gotten good reviews as well."
2381,2,"I have bought two of these, one for myself and another for a gift.  I like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad.  It is a very solid product!"
2382,2,"Product came on time and intact.  Easy to set up and very compact.  Attaches directly to shoulder strap for easy carrying.  Used for the holiday season in 2008 and found that it needs a direct line of sight to the XSI for signal to be received.  Tried from different angles and distances and found this to be true.  Often times, you simply need to be next to the optical reader on the camera to activate the shutter release.  For group portraits with family and friends, you may need to hide remote discretely and in line with the camera for line of signal site and to release shutter.  Outdoor and indoor single portrait shots are simpler since I simply mount XSI on the tripod and focus on subject.  I can stand by the camera and activate remote to get a steady, no vibration shot.  It works great for those kind of shots.  I recommend this product for group/individual portraits but beware of signal receiving issues."
2383,1,"I wish I could give this monitor a good review.  However, after 2 defective ones in a row, I simply cannot recommend it.My first monitor kept losing the picture.  After 15 or so minutes, the screen would go blank.  I would have to power the monitor down and back up to get the picture back.  I thought this might be a fluke, but this kept happening after 15 to 30 minutes.  I plugged my old monitor back in to make sure it wasn't my video card -- it worked perfectly.  Another hookup to the LCD and the picture went out again.  The cables were secure.  I took it back.My second monitor unfortunately had quite a few stuck-on pixels.  A stuck-on pixel is where a pixel is always 'on' while viewing the screen even when the video source does not have instruction to be on.  For example, a completely black screen had different pixels or ""dots"" that were always lit.  It was like viewing the night sky with blue and green stars (no red ones...For what I could see with the monitor itself, the picture was very crisp and bright.  It is much brighter than my 17"" Samsung 171V that I currently own on another PC.  I tried several resolutions, and only the native 1280x1024 had clear text.  1024x768 and 1280x960 both had blurry text.  Some DVD tests I ran on it were quite good, and the response time was good enough to keep up.  The monitor is very lightweight and takes up very little space.  I honestly wish I could have received one without problems.I may still consider this monitor after getting over the bad quality of the first two.  I would give quality 1 star and performance (when working) 5 stars, averaging a 3-star rating from me.  I would highly recommend buying it from somewhere that had a good return and exchange policy.  Some e-tailers out there do not think dead or stuck-on pixels are a problem until they run up beyond 5 (or even 8 at one place).  One bright, stuck-on pixel in the center 60% of the screen is unacceptable to me.  The picture was excellent and this would be a good buy except for the defects, so buy at your own risk!"
2384,1,I owned this item before. It used to work correctly and at some point started crashing every day. When I recover it the next day it will crash again. Eventually it stopped working one day and ended up in the dumpster. That prompted me to move to the DI-704UP. I don't recommend it.
2385,2,"I haven't travelled with it yet, but so far I really like it. The waist option, versus the shoulder strap, is neat. I didn't realize it had that until I was packing it up. Of course, I'd love something a little slimmer and more lightweight, but that just isn't practical when you're looking for the convenience of a carry-all, with the reassurance of protecting your investment."
2386,2,This product performs as advertised. I use it to connect a Bose Quiet Comfort headset to my computer for gaming and such to not annoy others nearby. Makes it much easier to control the volume with a physical wheel then through windows. Not much else to say about it.
2387,2,Excellent sound for the money. I only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them. She loves them and won't give them back.
2388,0,"UPDATE- I emailed amazon to let them know about this router since their supplier may be giving them second run products and they have offered to allow a return of this and refund my money. So Amazon does stand behind their products!I bought this router and for unforseen reasons I was unable to install it until this past week, the dumb thing is defaulted to spanish and will not revert to english! I spent almost 2 hours on the phone to linksys and they could not do anything with it. After almost an hour I asked for the supervisor and even he could not get the router to english. They offered to send me a newer version but placed a hold on my credit card of $79! To make matters worse the new one would not even connect to the internet. I contacted tech support but I refused to spend another 2 hours on the phone so I sent it back and will be calling them to remove the hold on my card.I kept the spanish one only until I can find something to replace it other than linksys, it at least connects to the internet but I can't secure it since I can't read or speak spanish! At least I don't live where many could have any access to it.Why would amazon even sell one that is in only spanish!?"
2389,1,"I cannot live without an optical mouse, and I got this one at work expecting it to be perfect.  It isn't perfect.  The tracking on it is great - it never sticks like the roller type and it moves smoothly without any jitter.My two main gripes are 1)  It is too light.  It is so light that it feels cheap.  2)  I don't have large hands, but just setting my hand on top of the mouse causes the right click button to click.  This is very annoying when trying to browse the net or work  as it usually causes some type of popup menu to appear.  I'd prefer it to be heavier and to make the buttons (especially the right click button) much smaller and a little harder to click."
2390,0,"I have this switch behind a DSL modem. Since DSL speed is only 8Mb/s, the 10/100 speed is plenty.  The unit is nice looking and running cool.However, it suddently stopped sending traffic through it today, even all the lights are working fine.  I powered down all the computers and reboot DSL modem many times, could not find anything wrong -- until I replaced this switch with another one.I don't know what was wrong with it. All lights work fine. when a cable plugged in, the ports lighting up fine.  But no traffic passing through.  I was hoping if it died, at least the light also off, so that I could know it is this switch's fault."
2391,2,"I bougt my KOSS Porta Pro in 1992 for usage on a Walkman.The day I bought it I believe must have changed my life ;-)Up to now (16 years !!) I did not find any portable headphone that delivers more sound.What makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproduces.The bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwall.There are no words to describe the atmosphere it creates.When listening to classic music concerts its like you are there.When listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of you.When listening to pop, rock, disco, dancefloor, techno - you name it - it delivers the pump you would expect from BIG speakers.The clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunning.I still remember the first time I used those, the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a moment.Note that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off. This can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with it.I dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep (because of the pressure on the ears).The little blue ""comfortzone"" switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head. I don't think that's working as advertised, whatever the settings it didn't feel any different for me. The headphone is very light and foldable. When folded they are the size of a small apple.The headphone comes with a softcase.Summary:The speakers are not as compact as in-ear plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphones.The fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the price.When listening - especially first time - be prepared to be left speechless. As mentioned above they have a few short comings (which product doesnt ?) but it is still a product with well deserved 5 Stars !!"
2392,2,"Using photoshop, and being a big fan of bulb exposures the RS60 E3 is a must have accesory.  You can use it just as you would the shutter button on the Digital rebel, as well as lock the shutter open, which is very good for painting with a small flashlight, etc.My only qualm with the switch is the shortness of the cord, but if you're trying to take a self portrait with the remote, then you need to get the Infrared remote.  The two of those combined makes for a perfect pair of tools for any remote picture taking needs."
2393,2,"These audiophile headphones have no business being less than $40.  Well, they kind of do...They sound great and have audio design by John Bruss.  The sound imaging is pretty amazing and they respond beautifully in their frequency range at all volumes.  I wear them for ~7 hrs per day at work and they're not as fatiguing as earbuds.  The look is VERY 80s, so you def won't have to worry about people stealing your surprisingly awesome headphones.  The headband can grab your hair if you pull them on over your head, so make sure to pull them open before putting them on.They saved money on the industrial design, but spared no expense on the audio quality."
2394,0,"Got it on sale...what a waster. Really noisy. Ended up turning it off and using it like I did the cheaper version (portable cool pad), just for the elevation off the table."
2395,1,"Sony cut corners, probably saved a nickel, by hardwiring a very short 24 inch long phono cable to the back of the unit. Since turntables cannot normally be stacked on top of other audio equipment (e.g. amplifier/receiver), they end up on the side or on another shelf, too far away for the included 24 inch long cable. You'll need to either find some RCA phone jack to phono jack (female to female) connector adapters, or a female RCA jack to male RCA phono plug cable. You can order through Amazon, but you may not find these connectors or cables in local hi-fi outlets. I give this unit only 3 stars because of this frustrating irritation - got already to set it up to replace an old turntable and discovered I was 12 inches too short to plug into my receiver/amp's phono input.  Since nearly all adapter cables are 3 to 6 feet in length, I am not sure what Sony was thinking with the very short 24"" (or so) hardwired cable on the back of the unit except a lame attempt to save a nickel in manufacturing."
2396,1,"I just wanted to confirm Steven G Neubeck's review. I am on my second set of 641s, after having returned the first set under warranty. I am now told by Altec that the 641 is discontinued, so if I turned my second set, I would receive a lesser quality set of speakers. If memory serves, I believe they said I would receive 5100s.Here's the beef. The speakers are great, but in my case, the subwoofer on both sets has died after about 5-6 months use. Since I do not plan to return my second set, I decided to see if I could fix the sub, and discovered the source of the problem.First, I noticed that if I left the speakers unplugged for an extended period of time - not just turned off but unplugged - the subwoofer would start to work again after I turned it back on. A light bulb lit up somewhere over my head, and I suspected there was a heat issue. After plugging it back in it would work for a while, then quickly begin to stutter, until finally it stopped producing bass again.The satellites have never been a problem.So I took the sub apart. Disclaimer: I do not recommend this to anyone, as there is nothing inside that can be removed, as the box is actually very well made with everything sealed in place with very strong heat-glue. To remove any of the internal components would involve melting the glue, which is quite impractical. It will not unstick just by prying either, as that will simply break the plastic part that the glue is holding. Trust me.After failing to extricate anything from the sub, I peered inside with my flashlight to see what I could see. There are two visible circuit boards one on top of the other, and one heatsink mounted perpindicular to the top board. At the far end of the bottom board, I noticed some molex style plugs. They were very inaccessble being at the very center of the sub, behind the speaker inputs, and various other circuitry. But I could plainly see that the plugs were MELTED. So, I did what any experienced computer builder would do, and left the rear panel off. Apparently, the sub was not getting enough cooling, and as long as it stays cool, it works, melted plugs and all. I now have it plugged into a switched outlet, so I can completely disconnect the power after I am done using it.Warning: Should you attempt the same remedy, be concious of the power connector leads on the inside bottom of the rear panel. They are exposed, potentially creating an electrocution/fire hazard."
2397,0,"I purchased these Sony Noise Canceling Earbud Headphones hoping that they would be a smaller and more portable version of my Sennheiser HDC 451 noise suppression headphones, which are excellent.  I couldn't be more disappointed.First off, they were extremely uncomfortable to wear.  They go directly into the ear canal.  And even though they have interchangeable pieces (for a better fit), they still had a tendency to fall out -- which was annoying.The earbuds also block the ear canal completely.  If you've ever stuffed cotton (or earplugs) in your ears, you'll know that this causes one's own breathing to become very noticeable -- which is exactly what happened!  And if I turned my head and brushed the earphone cord against me -- I could hear that too!As positives, the Sony's did a decent job of filtering the lows.  But they did nothing to screen the highs (as do my Sennheisers), so things like room fans, air conditionings and dishwashers were still much more noticeable than I would've liked.  The sound quality of my music, though, was excellent.  And there was none of the hissing and buzzing I've gotten from lower priced noise canceling headphones from other brands.Overall, I couldn't help but suspect that the tight fit of the earbuds was responsible for a large portion of the headphone's noise suppression capabilities -- and not necessarily the electronics.In conclusion, if you're accustomed to earbud style headphones, you might find these Sony's to be an improvement over ambient.  I, unfortunately, found them to be extremely uncomfortable to use and -- for the money -- hugely disappointing!"
2398,0,This battery has 1800mah while the Sony has 2100mah... go for the Sony!
2399,2,It's so convenient having a volume control for my earphones.  I use this when watching my TV since there is no volume control for the earphone connection.  I may order another one for use with my iPod so I won't have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volume.
2400,2,"Using a flash bracket allows the flash unit to be located away from the camera, which reduces shadows and generally improves the quality of your flash photography.  Canon's Off Camera Shoe Cord 2 is a convenient accessory that provides the required link between the camera's hot shoe and the flash bracket's clamp.Cord 2 is easy to use, and is generally very sturdy, however care should be taken to avoid putting excess stress on the critical screws that hold the components together.  This applies primarily to the connector that the flash unit is attached to, as this connector bears the weight of the flash unit and batteries.When attached to a bracket, and the camera is held horizontally in the landscape mode, the flash unit is upright and the stress due to gravity is minimal.  However when the camera is held vertically (portrait mode), the weight of flash imparts significantly more stress on the connector, and the screws that hold it together.  The affect of gravity on the flash unit tends to pull the connector apart.  Similar stresses occur when the arm of the bracket is rotated between the vertical and horizontal position, or simply when the camera with the bracket attached is swung around.  The housing of the connector is made up of two hard plastic sections held together by three tiny machine screws.  Over time, stress and torque can cause these screws to work loose, or even strip their threads.The flash contacts area a second potential problem area.  The flash contacts are mounted to a plate that is held in place by four screws located under the metal retaining clip that holds the flash unit in place after it slides in.  Under stress, these screws can also work loose, resulting in the flash failing to operate.  Tightening the screws will usually make the cord usable again, but you may need to have a small screwdriver handy in case this happens during a shoot.In my case, the four screws securing the contacts became loose, causing my flash to fail to operate.  By tightening the screws after every use, I was able to continue using the cord a few more times, until the connector actually split apart and broke.  While the camera was in the vertical position, the screws stripped out of the base of the connector.  Fortunately the wiring remained attached between the broken pieces, because they prevented my flash unit from falling to the floor and possibly being damaged.I'm on my second cord now, and am constantly aware of any stress that I put on the tiny screws in that critical fitting.  Cord 2 is a great accessory, but it definitely has a weak spot.  Care must be taken to minimize the stress that gravity places on the flash unit connector, to insure that it lasts as long as possible.  It is not an inexpensive item, so buying replacement cords is a rather costly proposition."
2401,0,"I bought this 650+ with a D Link AirPlus 614+, also supports 22 Mbps. Upon installing the software and rebooting the card came up ok for the first few time. Then it was not recognized by the computer and wanted to reinstall the drivers. Plus, the card did not let me connect to other computers on the network to transfer files. The card has been intermittent and pain. Very bad product or just this set of router and pc card. Do not recomend this line of products. The hub DHCP server died in less than six months. Several techs tried to install and setup and on several Dell laptops. Tried a Linksys USB card and it work great. So think again about purchasing this product."
2402,2,"I've had the Koss PortaPro's for about four months now and I decided it was time to give them the review they deserved.I mainly used standard Sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when I'm on my desktop computer or laptop, and I would use earbuds with my iPod on the go or in bed at night. I decided I wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews they've been getting.When I received them they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be, but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable. I can't even feel them after a while. They do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears don't feel sore after long listening sessions.They sound great and they look great, too. Some people might think they look too wild/retro/geeky, but that's what I like about them -- they are unique in their design. They don't look bad to me at all.They have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound. The highs are crisp, the mids are warm, full, and natural, and the lows are tight, deep, and full-sounding. They do have a little bit of extra bass, but that's no problem for me. I can just turn off the EQ on my computer audio player and they sound perfect. I always have the EQ off on my iPod so they sound just fine there, too. The extra bass really isn't that bad at all. It shouldn't affect your buying choice with these headphones.Yes, they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them, but they are surprisingly durable. I've fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when I wake up finding them near my pillow off my head, I'm worried they had been destroyed. To my surprise, I find no bends or any signs of stress on them. The ear pieces don't even fall off either, and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like. (They pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears.)The only cons I have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length. It's 4ft. long, but I sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when I'm not careful. That's fine though, as I just use another 4ft. extension cable I found. I also have to adjust the headband to almost it's widest when I put them on. I wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headband.These have become my standard headphones for at-home and on-the-go listening. Overall, these are great headphones and I will definitely choose these for the rest of my life, or until they stop making them."
2403,0,"The air flow from the two fans is barely noticeable even half an inch from them.And flow is in the opposite direction of what I would expect.I.e. the air is sucked in from the top and pushed out along a longnarrow strip on the long thin side. This causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad. And I suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops, most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in air.I would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of it.There is no way to reverse the flow, and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axle.Total waste of money, other than to see how cheaply todays products are made."
2404,2,"I purchased this security device for my old trusty iBook.  While the laptop is worth like 100.00, it does contain information and programs that are priceless to me.  I am moving overseas and this cable is exactly what I was looking for.The ""T-bar"" fits perfectly into apple's port and is very easy to take off.  I know that some other reviewers were having problems with their newer macbooks so I was a bit concerned.  If you have a ""vintage"" ibook/powerbook/G4 this should serve you well.Remember that this is NOT a heavy duty Chain.  If someone has access to your locked laptop for more than 15 minutes, I can think of a handful of ways to break the cable.  On hindsight, if you leave this attached to a desk while you use the bathroom, I would highly doubt that someone could break this within several minutes.  Although anything is possible...  It is still better than nothing."
2405,0,This is not worth the price. It is not dependable. The picture quality is average at best. The media compartments are flimsy and sluggish in response. Look at other brands. For a few dollars more you can do much better (think Toshiba or Sony).
2406,2,The antenna was sturdily made and was a better quality than the one I was replacing. The connection points were well thought out to allow ease of installation.
2407,2,"Man oh man,,,I stuck this sucker in  really less than 2 sec's later it was done...so I thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old VHS player tv combo..................................but how wrong I was...as I did it again just to be sure...and less than 2 sec's later....done !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...so either dry VHS cleaners are better than the wet type or I and I alone got a magic special cleaner for my tv/vhs combo............."
2408,2,"I have had this bag for about a year now and it is great for keeping a grab and go kit together.  The comments about how many lenses you can really carry in this thing are valid.  I carry 28-135mm EF on my 20D most of the time and I lug around a 17-85mm EF-S and a 50mm EF.  I figure I have room for two or three small lenses like a macro, tele extender, or macro tube - Or on big lense (I think I can get a 100-400mm in there without much of a problem.  I keep my battery charger, filters, cleaning kit etc. in the bag all the time.  But if you know what type of shooting you are going to be doing then plan accordingly.  If you filled this bag up with glass you would not want to carry it all day anyway.My only grip are the little metal clips creak a little but a few inches of electrical tape cured this."
2409,2,"Let me start off by saying I have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly. The sound quality is amazing, clear voice, nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering. To the people saying they feel cheaply made, mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one. They are fairly comfortable for what they are, they fit great under a hoodie, there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level. I highly recommend."
2410,2,"This is an amazingly capable device. In just a couple of hours, I was able to install applications, build a text book from a project Gutenberg source, download and read current news articles and listen to an audio book from audio.com.If the device has a weak point, it is the handwriting recognition. I vaguely prefer graffiti.Physically, the device seems much more ""together"" than the early Palm Pilots did.."
2411,0,I bought this expecting a light weight extension cable but it is quite bulky.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2412,1,"There are numerous reviews of the sound, which is fine for phones in this price range.  I wanted to comment on the comfort.  I have a large head.  I wear a 7 3/4 hat.  These phones are not adjustable in any way -- just a single piece of plastic (although it is well padded).  The problem is the pressure on the ears, and the lack of padding on the earpieces.  The padding is too squishy, quite simply.  Do not buy these if you are a cabbage head like me."
2413,2,"My sister bought this lock for me as I will be going off to college soon. I have a 2011 aluminum 15"" MacBook Pro & this lock works well with it. It took a while to get it to work, but after reading reviews I found out that you have to align the little ""T"" on the lock with the 2 poles by inserting the key & then turning it rightwards. Once you have done that you can just insert it into your laptop & give the key a slight turn! The cable also seems like it would be pretty sturdy to discourage the average thief."
2414,1,"I was a Sharp Wizard user, so I was excited when they came out with a more sophisticated PDA.  I was swayed by the price and the pull out keyboard unit.  Since I purchased it in November 2003, I have not been able to sync anything but the address book and calendar.  This is a waste to me.  After several e-mails and phone calls to Sharp, I am considering chalking this up to a bad experience, and jumping out of the Sharp bandwagon and purchasing a Palm or IPAQ.  I am truly disappointed with this product and pray that you do not make the same mistake."
2415,0,"Hello,Nikon's ML-L3 is poorly built and does not preform consistently.  You would think one would only have to push the button and the camera would take a picture, but it does not happen that way.  With the camera set properly for remote control, the unit makes the camera fire only 50% of the time.  It will not work behind the camera (for macro work) that is why Nikon added a cable release on the new D70s.  I am told the following remotes will work on the D70.  You can find them here at: [...].  I have not tried them myself but have it on reliable information that they preform better than the ML-L3.A person does not have much of a choice when it comes to buying a remote for the D70 and for the life of me I cannot understand why Nikon would sell such a cheap and disappointing piece of junk.  When consumers accept such poor quality in workmanship and function it lowers the quality bar one more notch.Thanks,Bill"
2416,2,"You really can't beat the sound of the headphones for the price. They fit really well, sound amazing, look sweet and rival higher end headphones. I am going to pick up a set for work and home. Even though they are portable, I still forget them. :)"
2417,2,"Let's face it, these faceplates are frivolous; however, they are fun, and now inexpensive too.PalmOne m100 Handheldare easy to remove and put in place, once you get the hang of it. Some colors are better than others, a quick review follows:Original Black -- use it in front of your boss. Or your Goth buddies.Silver is ok --  not bad but its nothing special either, cell phonish.Pacific Blue -- very nice, fine for the office too.Red -- all the red colors are fine, and tend to draw attention.Blue mist -- very attractive, not out of line for work either.Arctic White -- goes great with that iPod.Purple Passion -- Ghastly. Remarkably horrible.Burl Wood -- This one is a real success. Very, very attractive, and when used with thePalmOne m100 Series Slim Leather Carrying Caseit looks outstanding in any setting.There are other brands out there who make Palm faceplates too. They usually aren't quite as well made, but offer choices you can't find elsewhere. Two very nice colors available this way are Titanium Green and Dalmation (not exactly a color but very cool, I put a photo of each in the ""photo sharing"" section.) Both colors can be found on Palm's web site."
2418,2,"I have been debating to buy these for a long time. Finally I did and I am very happy I did.Sound is the best I have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than I first thought it would be.I cannot tell how it looks, since I am wearing it. But who cares if the sound is so good."
2419,0,"We used this product on a Sony Vaio running Win2000. It was very difficult to set up and took several calls to lynksys support and several days out of our lives. Their support is good and I can see why, their products are hard to get working and without great support they would be lost.As it turns out this unit won't even run with the software that comes with it in our Vaio anyway and a support person on the phone instructed us on how to download boingo and use that to run it. Not all the support people know this fix.The notebook adapter worked fine once set up with boingo but what kind of an outfit sells you a product that won't even work with their own software and requires boingo?May never buy another cisco product."
2420,0,"I am not very technical when it comes to case fans, but I do have ears: these things are the loudest fans you can possibly meet. I have two in my case and everytime I turn it on, I feel the need to put earplugs in my ears. If you play music, o boy, you're gonna have to play it REALLY loud to overcome the LOUD, LOUD, LOUD fan.Pros- moves lots of air- it worksCons- loud- loud- loud"
2421,2,"These work great in bridged (mono) mode.  I ran three across the front of my home theaters in mono mode (one for each of my three front speakers).  They did great.  However, you do have to manually power each one up and down with the button on the front.  Not a huge deal, but it adds to the steps one must take.  I took them out of my theater, only b/c my receiver does a good job by itself and I did not have room for any more plugs in a new (old) house we bought."
2422,1,"I love the ergonomic keyboards, have been using them for years. But this replacement for my older one forced me to rebuild the old keyboard. This is smaller, kyes closer together, and out of the box, keys stuck a bit. I cleaned that up with a pocket knife (plastic scrapings) but still, it's difficult to jump from board to board like I do and always have to adjust to different sizes. I suspect the smaller board makes more money for Microsoft but it's not making more for me . . . I make a living using my keyboard. I'm taking much better care of my older boards now.  :-)"
2423,0,This product is a waste of time and money.  The sound quality is worse than am radio.  If your looking for sound quality don't buy this product.  Lot of static and interference no matter what frequency you set it to. It does not live up to its advertised claims.
2424,0,"Purchased July 23, it's now Aug 5th and the thing is dead. No Power. Dunno what the warranty is, am going to try and contact them, but honestly, that amount of time indicates the thing sucks."
2425,2,"After reading a very positive review of these headphones in Computer Shopper Magazine I decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classes.I like their light weight, compactness, and great sound quality. Over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to. For now I am very pleased with them."
2426,2,"I bought this player when it first came out and it is an incredibly solid and reliable unit. The only major flaw is that it does not fast forward (search) or rewind (reverse search) through individual MP3 files (it searches fine on CD Audio files). It also searches fine through folders/directories, both CD Audio and MP3's. The LCD isn't that great but that's not important to me. It doesn't read id tags but I don't care about that either.If id tags and FF/REW doesn't matter to you, I'd say buy this one. It will play ANYTHING you throw at it. ANYTHING! 32-320 bitrate, 22,44,48Hz, CDR, CDRW, ISO9660, Joliet. I was thrilled with the player, but I really need a FF/REW feature because I listen to many MP3 books. Some of the chapters are 30-45 mins long. If I have to stop in the middle of a chapter, I end up having to listen to the first half all over again!! bummer. So I bought a RioVolt to solve that problem.Anyway, my Expandium is still alive and well and used for MP3 songs, not books. I highly recommend this product except for that one MP3 seach flaw. I hope Philips gets the hint and will fix this in their next rev.-The case is well made and sturdy. -The hold button works fine. -The sound is good (if you don't use the included earbuds). -The separate Line Out works great. -I've never heard it skip a beat. Ever! and I'm not exactly dainty with electronic gear. -The Resume feature resumes to the begining of the last track played.  note: This is another less important flaw (to me)--it doesn't resume to the exact spot where you powered off, but at least it goes back to the folder and file you were last listening to. Many players don't resume at all! Supposedly, the RioVolt resumes to the exact spot with a firmware upgrade--haven't tried it yet.Bottom line: Buy it if you don't need to search thru individual MP3's and if you don't need id3 tags."
2427,2,"tape is fine, still much waste with the way the printer works unless one does 'continuous' printing."
2428,2,Have been meaning to pick one of these up for ages now.  It's really small so I will likely buy a clip or something to attach it to my camera strap while in use so I don't use it.  The only downside I can see straight away is the very short cord.Looking forward to trying it out.  Great packaging.
2429,1,"I pre-measured out what I needed for my project, and this 50 foot roll, ended up being 46 feet long. I guess I shouldn't have ""cut it so close"" with my measurements. But, that extra 4 feet would have done it. Grrrr...Ordered the 100 feet roll and now I have 50 extra feet - lol.Good quality stuff though, it is medium stiffness. And it kinda curls up on stuff, not too bad though."
2430,2,"I've owned Sennheiser, Sony and other headphones, and these are by far the best of the lot. I've used my pair for five months, and they have held up well to the rigors of daily use. Factor in the price, and you can't go wrong."
2431,0,"The right click broke. I should have expected a problem like this,  it IS made by Microsoft. Next time i'll go with a better brand, like Logitech, Kensington, or Belkin."
2432,2,"You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back, and that you can't get them in your ears fast enough...Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam. THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY, meaning you can get it into your ear. This alleviates the only real downside to the product."
2433,0,"I purchased this headset together with the corded phone that I have ordered. On the package, it indicates it is for cordless phone use. It works fine with my cordless phone. And when I have received the corded phone, it works for that as well. What a relife!However, it dose need a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio adaptor in order to use on my laptop. It works fine. But I probably would have ordered a model that has two ear pieces instead.Update after using it for few months: One of reviewer was right. Somehow, I can listen to people perfectly fine but people can hardly hear me, even after I have adjusted the volume on my phone. Finally, I have replaced it with an over the ear hands-free headset from local RadioShack.[updated after 8 months] I can hear people OK but people have problem hearing me.[updated after got a new headset] for panasonic kx-ts105b corded phone, plantronics cordless phone M220C headset is a much better alternative to this one."
2434,0,"The unit will sometimes leave the display on.  This happens without warning.  When it does happen, the battery drains down to nothing, and all your data is lost.  HP denies there's a design flaw, but just search google for  iPAQ 1910 battery problem  and you'll see I'm not the only one with this problem.  Otherwise, it's a great unit.  I'm going to try and get a refund for mine, and buy something else which doesn't have this problem."
2435,0,"I bought this about a year ago to upgrade from my netgear 802.11B router. I wanted the higher throughput (54mbps) and liked that it did WPA. My old router only did WEP64. I really liked my netgear router because it had good range and once i had it setup, it was rock solid. I almost never had to restart it because it had dropped my connection. With the WRT54G, however, I have to frequently power cycle it to have my laptop sync up to it.Also, with my WinXP machine there was an issue coming out of hibernation. Each time I had to ""repair"" the adapter. I never had to do this with my netgear router and the same Win XP laptop. I can imagine that it might be a WinXP driver issue, but I've had similar experiences with a newer Vista Laptop and in Linux as well (on both the older and newer laptops), so i highly doubt that it is a laptop hardware / driver issue.There is also an issue when i use VPN to connect to my office machine. I don't know what interaction with the router might be, but after I disconnect from the VPN, i lose wireless network connection. It doesn't matter what windows clean ups i perform (flushing dns, disabling wireless adapter and including restarting the machine) If i simply power-cycle the router, i am able to connect to it.So overall, i have a fairly low opinion of this product. I think I'll stick with netgear in the future."
2436,2,"I was looking to control the volume out of my Samsung UN40EH6030, which has a fixed volume output out of the 3.5mm jack. I wanted to used headphones when watching BluRays or playing 360, so I got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier. Works beautifully; no noise and the volume is sufficient. Excellent product for this type of use."
2437,2,"Kensington is the best, price is good, the lock is easy and works smoothly.  Another great product from Kensington!"
2438,0,I've had this product for less than a month and one day the jack just fell off. I'm not even kidding! This female jack just came disconnected from the rest of the cord and just fell off somewhere. I did not mistreat the cable in any way and I'm kind of upset that I wasted 2 dollars on this. Thankfully the seller contacted me about the issues and has offered a refund.
2439,1,"This is a good price for this speaker wire for the size and length of roll, but the issue I had was that I had to pull two sets of wiring through some wire moulding trim in my house, and the insulation on this wire seems to be a little thicker than on others.  Normally I would probably consider this to be a good thing, but it made the wire very hard to fit through the moulding, and the insulation is also rather ""grippy"" and caught on itself, and I actually had a piece of it snap off while trying to yank it all the way through.  Needless to say it broke off down in the moulding, so I had to pull it back out and restart it again.  Now that it's in place though, seems to carry the signal just fine and sound good."
2440,2,it was very good. took alot of pixs @ the Beach & resorts & didn't have to worry about it getting wet.
2441,2,"Ok the first thing about this review. I have a pair of the 'new' the Plug headphones. They are not the ones pictured here. They have no mute button and are metallic silver and purple in color not blue and yellow.Apprently KOSS got a lot of feedback from the first version, they listened, and made a much better product. The ones I have are just fantastic. Great bass, like the original, but very good mids and lows as well. They work better as isolation headphones then anything I have used before, but apprently people who are audiophiles are not that impressed. Also they have fantastic volume ability. Because they are in your ear canal I can turn my portable equipment up really loud. I don't but its nice if you want to. Music sounds great with these headphones. Frankly best headphones I have ever used, BUT I am using the NEW VERSION not the blue and yellow ones pictured here.OK right now what to do? I would call Amazon and MAKE SURE you are getting the new version. I never used the one they have listed here but almost everywhere I looked on the net, people say the new version is MUCH BETTER..."
2442,2,"nice case well made great for using while hilking or walking. clear plastic over view window, and a velcro closure."
2443,0,"Keep in mind, the only reason I'm replacing my existing 6 prong surge protector is to provide a screw anchor.  My old one keeps falling out.  So, my outlets don't have any ground faults or problems.  This is a relatively new (mid 80s) home in the US built to code. My current load on the outlet is low.  600W at most. I plugged in this brand new Belkin and POOF!  One of the sockets caught fire, shorted and blew my breaker.  This may be the worlds fasted ""surge protector"" failure.  I have to surmise that the engineering behind this device does not exist.  Fail.  Avoid."
2444,0,"I'm baffled, too. I don't know why a powered hub won't run my MacAlly iceKey keyboard, or my Canon S600 printer, or the brand new CanoScan LiDE60 scanner I had bought to use it with, but it looks as if I'm back to square one. All of the above items worked as soon as I plugged them straight into my MacMini's USB ports. Everything lights up I've plugged and unplugged the hub, and each time I get the ""low power"" warning, even for the keyboard. A hub like this is supposed to be plug and play, especially on a Mac. Something is wrong, somewhere. I've wasted an evening trying to get it to work. I'm out UPS 2Day shipping, but I'm sending it back."
2445,0,I ordered this radio for my travels between my home in Canada and my home in the States. When I received the radio I tried it out and seemed to work ok although it didn't have much more than a mile distance. When I was ready to travel back to Canada (about 5 months after receiving it) I tried using it and it just did not work....period!I contacted Cobra via email and their response was 'ship it to us and we will repair it for $45.00 + shipping. The warranty had expired but it hadn't really even been use other than to test it.I was totally upset with their response and have never been able to use it since. I had a Cobra in the late 70's to early 80's and it worked great so I am totally annoyed that they wouldn't look after this problem for me and will definitely NOT buy a Cobra product again. STAY CLEAR OF THIS ONE.
2446,0,"I was mislead by the title here. This item is a REPLACEMENT for the Canon CB-2LS. It is NOT a Canon product. It does indeed charge the NB-1L battery. It does work on an AC or DC power source. The real Canon CB-2LS is a neat, compact unit about the size of a deck of cards and the AC power prongs fold down out of the way when not in use. It will store quite easily in a camera bag. This item here is about 50% larger and comes with an AC transformer and power cord and another power cord with a cigarette lighter adapter. Just what I needed, another product with a transformer and power cords to keep up with. This is listed as the Canon CB-2LS, but it is not. I will be sending it back because it is NOT what I wanted nor was it what I was lead to believe I was ordering.Addendum: Today, I see that my review is accomapnied by a picture of the real CB-2LS by Canon. The price here is about $35 which is probably the real thing. I paid about $20 for an ""equivalent"" [though ""equivalent"" was not in the product description]. My advice is that you should be sure that you are getting the real Canon CB-2LS. If the price is too good, you probably are not."
2447,2,"I think every pair of headphones should have built-in volume control, but a lot of them don't, so this bit of kit is needed.  They work just as expected with no degradation to the sound quality."
2448,0,"I've tried this on five surfaces - a soft foam mouse pad, a textured pad, a smooth plastic pad, a dark wood table and a light wood table. I have four other Kensington and Logitech cordless optical mice that work on all of these surfaces. The MX700 lazily lags behind (at best) and skates off across the screen (at worst).It's a little too narrow for my hands, too. My pinky has to go a long way to grip it and it leaves my hands sore after a few hours."
2449,1,"We got our Bose 3-2-1 about 6 months ago.  Overall, it's pretty good.  It was easy to setup and the sound quality is good.You'll like this system if: you want something easy to setup, you want a complete audio entertainment system with high quality (not excellent) sound, you want to be able to play CDs and DVDs.You won't like this system if: you want true surround sound, you want a headphone jack, you want to play DVDs that you create with your PC (including VCDs, DVD+Rs, etc - the only DVD it plays is the kind you buy), you want a home stereo that has high volume, you want your universal remote to work with it.If Bose made some very basic improvements, they would have a great system, including:* Support all homemade DVD formats* Have the volume range higher* Add a headphone jack (better yet, have a wireless port for wireless headphones)* Include a universal remote (or make their remote compatible with universal remotes)"
2450,2,"5.5 starsFor my 200th review, I thought I'd sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things I've ever owned, the PortaPro. I got these shortly after they came out, as I always longed for bass in my early Aiwa walkman (best of breed back then). These thangs changed my life!I still love music deeply, but back in school it was everything to me, my solace and balm and ecstatic release, hours and hours every day. I still wear mine daily while running the dog, walking the dog, and during various non-dog activities as well. They have tremendously balanced sound, lots of bass but very open and tight bass, not sloppy. The highs are clean and never harsh, the mids smooth and present. From Bach to the Beatles to Metallica to Charlie Parker, they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum, top to bottom.For the money they are a miracle! They turn any mp3 player into a real sound machine, and BLOW AWAY any of the in-ear phones except for the thousand dollar customs (go to the HeadRoom online if you want perfect sound...they sell these alongside the best cans in the world, say no more). They deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detail.Add to that two great features. They fold up easily and fit in your pocket (make sure to get the folding ones, worth the extra few bucks for sure), making them a perfect companion to tiny mp3 players (they are a perfect match with my Muvo 2gb player, such sound from such tiny devices!).But THE best feature of the PortaPros is the inestimable LIFETIME guarantee!! And they ain't whistlin' Dixie, folks, they mean it. I would know, as I've bought maybe four of these in the last 20 years, but I've owned about 14 new pairs total! Whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear (can happen, it's only thin rubber and wire, happens now and then when you're mountain climbing etc), I send them back to Koss with a six-dollar check (only gone up one buck in 20 years) and in a week I get a BRAND NEW pair. If that ain't taking care of the customer, what is?So, for coming through on their promises, and for making a truly great-sounding and very cheap-for-the-quality headphone, I give Koss total props and praise for this product, one of the best values I've ever encountered as a music uberlover. This and a Muvo 2gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go. I have enjoyed my PortaPros on mountain tops, inside the Louvre, Prado, MOMA, etc, by the sea, on ski slopes, on trains in the high alps with views to die for as Beethoven's Sixth took me to heaven, in the subways and busses of dozens of lands, in front of literally thousands of sunsets from Big Sur hills to Jamaican beaches to Mallorcan cliffs to Norwegian fjords and so on for twenty-plus years.I can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet. If we've achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years, this is it: great portable sound that turns any post office line, etc from a nightmare into a dream.In fact, now that I think of it, no product I've ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy, except perhaps some of my guitars. The Pros were 25 bucks in the mid-80s and are now only 35; with inflation it should be far more. Thank you Koss for proving that some companies still know what value is. This is a bargain of the highest degree. Whoever invented these, I LOVE you!Buy some for a friend; I have, many many times. And make sure to buy some for yourself; your life will become a lot sweeter, especially if you know how to let music take you far beyond this mortal coil.My highest recommendation."
2451,2,Night and day difference between these and either of my old Sony headphones. Blows away Nano earbuds. Money well spent.
2452,2,I have had this unit for quite a while I think I got it when it was on sale.  I still use it in the bedroom listening to cd's putting me to sleep at night.Great deal.  The controller is another story if you make a controller with all the same size buttons with no distiguishable pattern make it illuminate so you can see it at night.  I have memorized many controllers by use but this one I still have to turn on a light to find the right button.
2453,1,"Seems well built, but haven't seen it doing anything yet, other than resetting it self all of a sudden for no reason."
2454,0,This player is too old and not worth the money. Spend a few more bucks and get a player with Gb's of storage space and way better audio output.
2455,2,"Just unboxed these today and started listening to them, and my first impression is that they're quite possibly the simplest and most functional I've ever used. No frills, no sexy designs, no gimmicks, no extra features, just GREAT sound and a fantastic, functional design that has withstood the test of time. I read the reviews that others gave and I thought ""they can't be THAT good,"" but for the price, I didn't have much to lose.Pros-Adjustable earpieces work surprisingly well; basically, it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears. I find that my ears get sore with most headphones, but these are very comfortable.-The adjustable headband will fit any head size. I haven't got my hair caught in it yet.-They fold up for greater portability, and come with a very stylish leather bag (probably fake leather, not sure).-The sound is fantastic, better than anything in this price range. Clear mids and highs, and decent bass that doesn't sound distorted when I crank it.Cons-No manual/directions. They weren't that hard to figure out, but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice. It took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband, then clip together the earpieces, then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bag.-I'm sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out, but luckily they sell cheap replacements.-The leather bag is quite small, and the headphones barely fit inside.Overall, great headphones. They do what they do, and nothing more. Perfect.**UPDATE, ONE YEAR LATER**: I accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones. I shipped them to Koss and they sent me back a brand new pair for free (but I had to pay $9 for return shipping). No nonsense or forms to fill out, just a new pair of headphones in about a week. Koss, you've gained a lifelong customer."
2456,0,"Ordered a 3.5mm male connect received a 2, had to run around to get a adaptor for $5 more. Then the mouth piece failed. Totally useless for what I wanted.Up side my kid uses it with his X Box."
2457,0,"I bought these with the intention of replacing my iPhone earbuds for use at the gym. The iPhone earbuds just didn't fit me and would constantly fall out when running on the treadmill. I purchased these Sony headphones because they were inexpensive.I found them to be made of hard plastic that had rough edges. I could feel them scraping my ear, especially when running hard. They didn't really stay in place. They are vertically stabilized so they don't fall off of your ear, but there is nothing really keeping them horizontally in place and sticking in your ear so you can hear them. Also, the audio quality isn't the greatest and as you turn up the volume the sound becomes distorted.After 2 weeks of gym usage (1 or 2 hours a day, 5 days a week) the left earbud stopped working. I ended up just throwing them away. It wasn't worth pursuing a warranty claim on something so inexpensive. I went with the over-the-ear earbuds from Philips and I was much happier!"
2458,2,"My Fiancee and I have many, many, VHS and DVD movies.  Here VHS player started messing up, so we went to store after store looking for a cleaning tape. Finally ordered two cleaning tapes online. both work great."
2459,2,This is an absolutely amazing product. Twice it has made a VCR that is at least 10 years old go from unusable to working like a charm. It has certainly kept us from throwing out our VCR. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get more life out of their VCR.
2460,2,"Definitely a must-have accessory if you are doing long exposure or macro photographs.  I'm using mine with an EOS Rebel XTi and it works exactly like I expected.A half press sets focus/exposure and a full press releases the shutter.  Identical to the shutter button on the camera.  To hold the shutter open, you can continue holding the remote button down with your thumb, or you can slide the ""lock"" upwards and it will hold the button down for you.  Slide the lock down and it will release the button.  Ideal for use when the shutter is in ""BULB"" mode.For the price paid, it seems a little bit flimsy and fragile.  I wouldn't expect it to hold up under heavy duty use, but for my purposes, I expect it to last quite a while.  The half-press/full-press of the button is hard to ""feel.""  Unlike with the camera's button, you don't get a lot of feedback on when to stop pressing for a half-press.  Not a huge deal - the worst thing that would happen on a digital is a few extra shots on your memory card.If you need an external shutter release for your photography, don't hesitate on buying this Canon model.  If you see it for less than $10, buy two!"
2461,1,"It is a coupler for RJ 45 connections, and it does the job, but that is about it.  I would have expected a little more substance to the product, but it is flimsy.  It does work, so 3 stars is all it gets..."
2462,1,"Let me start off by saying that this in general is a very good minidisc player.  With that aside i would like to say that everything else is far from being simple to use.  When you get ready to use this product you'll notice that you will need to use their software in order to transfer the MP3s to your MD player.it begins. . .The installation of OpenMG is one of the longest i have every seen.  Took me at least 4-6 mins to get it fully installed.  Now There are two separate programs, OpenMG and Simple Burner.OpenMG is the program that is used to transfer the MP3s over to the MD player.  Simple Burner mearly rips and transfers the newly made MP3s to you MD player.Sounds good right? . . .WrongOpenMG leaves traces of the song on your HD, so basically its filling your HD up with duplicates of your song but in their format (ATRAC).  Then they put a restriction on it which only allows 3 transfers of one song (called checking out) and after that you will have to delete the song by using this software (called checking in) in order to be allowed more transfers.Simple Burner only allows you to rip the songs to LP2 or LP4 (basically compresses it to fit more songs) but there is no option to rip it in STEREO (i need this in order for it to work on my old MD player which does not support LP.There are ways around it though, you can download REALONE PLAYER GOLD and then add a device section to download a patch for NET MD SUPPORT.  It then becomes basically OpenMG but without leaving any copies in ya HD.  It is easy to manage songs on your Minidisc as well.With that being said, Yes this player is the best for its price, but be ready to be disappointed by its software that is used to transfer your songs."
2463,2,This case is excellent. I recommend it. I bought it for my gps and because it's leather. Very good. a
2464,1,"Bought it on Amazon.  The pick up pattern of the outside sensor is weird.  It misses the mail carrier on our mail box next to the front door, but triggers on someone walking by on the sidewalk.  Also triggers on nobody at all (a squirrel maybe?).  I tried pointing it down but does not help.  My wife leaves it turned off, so it does us no good.  The design and feel looks real good.  Maybe if you can orient it exactly right, or put white electrical tape over the lens to limit the sensitivity it could work, but I have not been happy with it so far."
2465,2,"These are outstanding headphones for the price, with excellent response across the frequency spectrum, and especially robust bass for such a small, lightweight set.  A friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large, over-the-ear type headphones.  Though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find, after listening to a comparison, that the Koss headphones sounded better. A lifetime guarantee never hurts, either."
2466,0,"My daughter purchased this player.  It works with the included software and the base memory only.  They have a bug in their SD support and Windows 2000/XP does not allow you to actually use the card.  I didn't know this when I purchased a $80 SD card to provide additional storage.  Also, this uses Musicmatch which insists on upgrading itself from the from the version included with the player.  If you perform the upgrade the software doesn't work properly with the player (yes--I installed the new plug-in).  All in all this is clearly a device built by a company that doesn't know how to interface to windows and it has caused plenty of grief in our house."
2467,1,I like it but it is a little erratic. Doesn't always go off. I have walked in front of it a bunch of times in a row to test it and sometimes it will not sense me and other times it will even though I pass by it exactly the same way each time. I'd say for the price it is a good purchase but don't leave a basket of expensive jewellery sitting out thinking this will prevent a robbery.  ;)
2468,2,I bought this for a canon t3i and it fits very well. it fit the canon t3i with 18-55m lens attached plus an extra 55-250mm lens and some little things like extra battery and memory card. But that's all you can cram into it. If you think you need to put in some more then you'll need a bigger bag. If not then this will do just fine.
2469,2,"It is absurd that these are so cheap. They sound basically as good as pro studio headphones. Totally effortless, full range of sound that is completely clear. And since they are open, you can still hear things around you, so you don't walk around with that sensory-deprived ""living in a cloud, disconnected from the world"" feeling.Also they're totally comfortable. Cannot go wrong with these."
2470,0,"Of course as all things computer related, as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically.  Unit works great but buy the 2 gig.  More bang for the $$"
2471,1,"I own a Z5500 and I think sharp has done a good job.The kernel is quite stable, just as one would expect from a Linux system.Once you can get the VNC service to run(which is very easy), you can do everything on the unit thru' the PC. The two expansion slot is good and comes handy if you want to access the files on SD while your cf network card is plugged in.Everything is cool, except that there are issues with Wi-Fi support with some Wireless cards. The Support people are quite clueless, and the only support they offer is send in the unit and we'll look at it, which kindda [stinks].The news groups are filled with people's concern on this matter and there seems to be no resolution from sharp.But again if you are not looking to use a wire less n/w card, I think you could go for it. There is plenty of stuff you can download and insall from various sites(handango, zauruszone, etc)"
2472,0,Instead look into CF1GB-40-278 (Lexar 40x) compact flash card. This one is Type 1 and slow as molasses. For about the same price the lexar card (which is Type 2) is almost 10 times faster. If you are into digital photography with atleast 3mp cameras you need to skip this card and get a faster one.
2473,0,"I had a Sony Hi-8 that was great. I love my Canon digital cameras so I thought I'd get a Canon MiniDV. Well, it works fine and has good features. The video is great, the audio and low light is probably not up to the Sony camcorders. Still, for the money I liked it and was happy. Just out of warranty it goes black and won't record. The shutter or CCD is dead. Reading online this seems to be a common problem with Canon camcorders. So, my new Sony MiniDV is rocking. If you are looking at a Camera, get a Canon, if you are looking at camcorders, get a Sony."
2474,2,"I have purchased about 10 sets of these over the past few years. I keep them everywhere - car, PC bag, desk, gym bag. They last forever, they fit snugly, they are great on the plane because they block the noise - and the price is terrific. Unlike other ""sit in the ear"" products, these stay. I ever wear them while riding the lawnmower, with big ear protector headphones over them, and it makes the work go faster and not seem like work."
2475,2,"This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX-90EC.  After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off, the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at. It took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller.  I had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope.  Once I learned the reference stars, the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby.  I cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controller!"
2476,0,"Takes great picture when you have a steady hand and when the subject is not moving. If you have kids who constantly move this will be hard to use especially indoors.I love taking picture using natural light so I used it indoors use with kids as subject is not good with this lens. Anyway, picture is good when the subject is still."
2477,0,"Stereo Sound but at what price ?.I never thought I would pay 50 bucks for this and since I got this as gift, I was excited.Save your money , This is not what you would expect from $50 sound !"
2478,0,"I have had nothing but problems with this wireless router.  The wireless connection setting on the router has to be reset every time I boot-up my laptop in order to obtain a connection.  And the IP address from cablevision keeps getting dropped (works fine without the router connected) and must be manually renewed every few days. The tech support people at SMC refuse to believe that it is their router.  The wireless card in my laptop works with 3 other wireless access points at my job perfectly.  But still, SMC tech supports insists it's not their router.  I have tried every thing, even a new SMC router.  I finally returned the router and purchased a different company's wireless router.  Needless to say, the new non-SMC router works perfectly and I've had it for over two months now."
2479,2,"It works as advertised, it's nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord. Mine doesn't look exactly like the one pictured (it's more squared off than rounded) but no big deal, I'm still pleased with it and do recommend it."
2480,0,"As another reviewer pointed out, the picture in this listing is a monaural adapter, showing only one band around the plug, where stereo plugs have two. I took a chance that the written description was accurate -- that this was a stereo 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. I needed it right away, so I had it overnighted.What I received was not only a monaural, not stereo, adapter, it wasn't even a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. What I received was a mono-to-stereo 1/8"" to 1/8"" adapter.With this kind of uncertainty you might want to opt for a different item with a clearer, more consistent listing."
2481,2,"Not being familiar with the Koss brand I was hesitant to order these headphones but with all of the consumer reviews being four stars and higher I decided to buy a pair. They are small, what you would expect from a cheap portable set. However, the sound blows me away. I hear every little nuance of the music. The bass is very present, the highs are crisp and clear. Well done Koss! They are comfortable to wear, easy to get a good fit with minimal adjustments. They do seem fragile, only time will tell. Get a pair, hear for yourself. I'm quite surprised and very happy with mine."
2482,0,"I suffered with this unit for about 2 weeks before I caved and returned it. I replaced it with a FAR more expensive Apple Airport Extreme, which works wonderfully. (I have a mixed Mac/Wintel LAN).I think my unit was defective, probably a defective 10/100 switch. It worked well in wireless mode, with range better than my older SMC (wireless card failed on that one).I really stress my LAN (backups, etc) so I might expose problems others might not notice. I suspect though that this is a true defect that hits some of these devices. I wonder, though, if the MR814 ever works properly with a secondary external switch.When I bought the device it didn't work at all with my Cisco 675 DSL/router, but a firmware update fixed that. Still, a bad sign that out of the box it was DOA on my LAN.Tech support never replied to an email inquiry.If you buy this device, ... DO NOT SEND IN THE REBATE UNTIL YOU'RE SURE YOU WON'T RETURN IT. ..."
2483,2,"I already have two ""no name"" inline volume controls, but I needed another.  This Koss unit was no more expensive from Amazon than another ""no name"" from an electronics store, and I've been a big fan of Koss since the late 70s, so I bought it.First, what it IS and ISN'T.  This is a volume control, but NOT an amplifier.  It will make your MP3 player, etc., quieter, but NOT louder.  If your source is too quiet, look for a headphone amplifier.When I used to listen to a cassette walkman it was easy to turn down the volume when I needed to.  The volume control was a thumbwheel right on the player.  I have several MP3 players now, and they all have hi-tech context sensitive controls.  This means (for me, anyway) that I have to look at the screen to make sure the button or slide control is set for volume.  This control solves that problem.  Set the player for a volume slightly on the loud side and use the inline control to get comfortable sound.  If you need to lower the volume (to talk to someone, for instance) you can use the volume control without taking your player out of your pocket.This model has a three foot cord between the player and the volume control.  This is nice if your player has an FM tuner -- MP3 players use the headphone cord as an FM antenna.  My generic ones were only about 8 inches long and the FM reception suffered.The control has a clip on it, so you can wear your player safely in a padded pouch on your belt and clip the volume control to your chest pocket.A few reviewers have noted that lowering the volume attenuates high frequencies.  I tried using the EQ settings on my player (I was also using Koss PortaPro headphones).  When I had Bass Boost EQ settings I did notice some high frequency attenuation in both the Koss and generic inline volume controls; when the EQ was turned off I didn't notice as much high frequency attenuation, but the sound was very ""flat.""  Anyway, I don't think I would have noticed it if other reviewers hadn't pointed it out.An inline volume control is very handy for portable MP3 players, etc., and this unit is well thought out, and works great."
2484,2,Works great for metal detectors that don't have volume control
2485,0,"I purchased two of these drives...one for my business and one for my daughter's college work.  One had to be returned immediately as it would cause the blue screen of death whenever it was removed from the computer.There is little documentation for the device, both with the package and at the Lexar site, (one of the most laughably sparse FAQ's I have seen) which leads to some misunderstandings:  The data light which is used to tell when it is safe to remove the drive does not illuminate on Windows 98, only on XP.  This is not mentioned in the manual.  I was told by Lexar that this is normal...it just is not mentioned in the manual.As others have posted, I have found the device can become unreliable after a short time.1. Occassional blue screens when the drive is removed. When deleting very large files, the blue screen is almost assured.2. Within the first month, I put in the drive to find all the imformation on it mysteriously gone and unrecoverable by me. I foolishly trusted the drive to hold the only files I had long enough to get it to another computer.  I know I should have made a backup, but it still should not have happened.3. Soon afterward, I found that the I could not rename files in the window...they would show only the name given when they were created.  This was true on whichever computer I used the device in.4. Soon after that, I could not drag files to the window either.  I could only alter files that were already on the drive (but not rename them.)5.  I use the briefcase function to transfer files between computers so I should have backups on both my home and office computers.  One evening I found that one important file containing several thousands of dollars of transaction records for customer orders had mysteriously (again) disapeared from the jumpdrive as the briefcase files updated, therfore erasing the copy stored on the computer, too.  As of this writing, I have not been able to uncover the files which may result in many hours of record rebuilding and possible financial losses.I cannot recommend this device as a reliable method of either transferring or storing data.I have transferred files between computers using floppys for six years now without these problems, so I have to assume the jumpdrives are at fault.  There are no other problems with the three other computers they were used on.Lexar has a help chat, but it is slow and not very helpful.  I used it a couple of times but the person at the other end was unable to solve the problem.  Both times, I got the same person which leads me to believe they don't have a big help staff.  The long delay between questions and answers led me to think that he was handeling a lot of peolpe at the same time, too.If you have the time to wait a day or two between responses, the email help is better.  Lexar did offer to try to extract the files the first time they went missing, but as of this time, even if they could I no longer trust the devices.  I am writing Lexar to see if I can return them for a refund.I bought the drive from Amazon, who is not at fault here.  They promptly replaced the original defective drive.  Lexar is now going to have to take the hit for the quality of their products because of the time that has passed between the purchase and the time the drive started to fail.  We'll see what happens."
2486,0,"All I have to say is this is the worst player ever! My MP3 cd player kept on skipping and having a rough time playing cd music. I didn't even bother of keeping it, I just throwed it outside my window into my trash can. There is way too much negative description for this player and it is way too much that I am not going to list them.RioVolt, if you want to try to make a better innovation for the community, then I suggest you to fix up this RioVolt SP350. Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this MP3 CD player!"

Not for anyone that doesn't like things in their ears. Best part, if you are a deaf fella like myself, you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds. Can get that perfect fit."

2491,0,"When I saw these I thought they were the old one's that Memmorex used to sell.  Memorex used to be a really good brand for media, but their CD-Rs just keep getting flimsier and flimsier.  I got these because the old black labels were really thick and lasted a long time.  They also held up great to scratching.  The new ones are cheap and the top often peals off which is even worse then a scratch on the bottom.  These seem to be as flimsy and cheap as the regular ones except black.  I would now choose a different media such as TDK, but unfortunately my old car stereo only prefers Memorex for some reason.The last 100pk spindle of Memorex CD-Rs I got werent black but seem the same.  Almost everyone has the top peeling or flaking off somewhere eventhough they were kept in a case most of the time.  And again, when the top peels off it seems to be much worse than a scratch (Data is completely lost).  Too bad a great brand turned to crap."
2492,1,"I picked one of these up to serve as the network adapter for my Tivo.  It worked right out of the box with no problems, but the connector is just way too sensitive.  If the network cable gets moved in any way, the connection is lost.  Very annoying.I'm sure this is a very handy product for some applications, but for more permanent setups I would sooner choose a larger, more stable network adapter."

First, one is charged, then the other is charged.The MH-19 is priced at $114.95 plus $8.95 for shipping.The MH-18 is priced at $39.46 with free prime shipping.You should buy two MH-18, have the ability to charge simultaneously, AND save $44.96.My MH-19 is several years old, and it has operated flawlessly; however, the price to value ratio is wrong.  I have several MH-18, and they are just as reliable."
2494,2,I like the selection of sizes and the storage container.  I've used these for tying up cables and holding things to each other.  I'm not sure I'll ever use all 500 but the price was good.  Clear color so unobtrusive.
2495,2,"The Canon Off Camera Shoe Cord 2 is indispensable for those who use a speedlight bracket for portrait photography. Raising the speedlight off the camera body helps eliminate hotspots, redeye and lens hood shadow in flash photography.Canon needs to make the cord much, much longer (don't know what electrical resistance problems this will cause) to utilize directly (as a master) with umbrella lights. I must use the umbrellas as slave units - because of the short cord length.One look at the set screws in the base reminded me of a problem pair of eyeglasses where the set screws backed out if you just looked at them wrong. A very careful application of CLEAR nail polish over each screw has prevented problems others have had (so far) with the screws backing out. This etches the plastic - apply sparingly and carefully.I'm CONSTANTLY checking, tightening, checking, remounting this cord and speedlight interface to insure reliable function of my 420EX and 580EX speedlights - mounted on a flashbracket with an adjustable arm. Flipping the arm back and forth for landscape and portrait picture formats - puts stress on the hotshoe and speedlight sides of the cord. After some failures - these compulsive actions become ""normal"" procedure!If someone has a better cord - I'll use it. In the meanwhile - if you use a flashbracket - you need this cord."

It worked great and had a wonderful picture -- at a great price.Now that we have had it a year, it recognizes less than half the disks we give it, otherwise showing the &quot;No Disc&quot; error. Now that it's below $50, it might be worth it if you think of it as a rental."
2497,0,"Pinnacle systems video editing software (Studio and Studio plus)promises so much but delivers very little of it. Furthermore, the technical support they steer you to is almost non-existant.With Studio, videos that I had edited and saved for later burning to dvd became impossible to access, making all the hours I put in a total waste. Studio and windows xp don't get along well resulting in frequent crashes and loss of data. E-mails to Pinnacle technical support got no answer. When I read about Studio Plus, I hoped all these problems would be resolved, so I ordered it. Now that I have it I find it won't install (tells me I entered the serial number incorrectly) After about a dozen attempts I have given up. Again I tried to reach Pinnacle Technical support and am getting nowhere. It's like beating your head against a brick wall. Users groups say Canopus doesn't do as much as Pinnacle promises, but it delivers, and the tech support answers when you call. Other people recommend Adobe Premiere, but say it's diffuclt to learn.But one thing for sure, if you want to feel the agony of frustration, try Pinnacle Studio."

The music played by these can be played at low volumes and i can tolerate. Very clear. One thing though, music is leaked really bad by these after bout 40% wich is bad cuz u know ppl can hear what you hear, and to me i dont like. Its plastic and aluminium, not the most durable of materials but hell with a lifetime warranty whos complaining. Its either these or some 100+ headphones. take these. Your wallet, and ears will thank you."
2499,1,"I have a love dislike relationship with Belkin products. I, as an IT Tech with experience back to the early days, found their products to be either good or boat anchors. Over the years, they have got better with the technical details of some of their product line.This cable works as designed.It is a recommend."
